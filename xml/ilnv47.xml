INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The blockade of all United States ports, including Galveston, has
been raised, and they are now open to foreign commerce.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has announced that, in consequence of England not
absolutely withdrawing the twenty-four hours' rule, the Federal
vessels will not pay the customary courtesies to vessels of the
British Navy. The Federal Government also refuses to recognise any
transfer of rebel cruisers, and claims the right to capture them under
whatever flag they may be placed.</p>
<p>President Johnson has appointed Andrew Hamilton of Texas, James
Johnson of Georgia, and Louis B. Parsons of Alabama, provisional
Governors of those States, in accordance with the programme adopted in
North Carolina and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Immense numbers of negroes, past work, have been expelled from the
cities of Georgia. Great mortality prevails among the negroes in
Charleston.</p>
<p>Provisional Governor Holden, of North Carolina, has issued a
proclamation calling for a Convention to amend the State Constitution,
to elect a Governor and Legislature, and to restore the complete rule
of civil law in that State. The Governor exhorts the people to become
loyal, good, and useful citizens. He officially announces to the
coloured people their freedom, and hopes they will become industrious,
as otherwise their race cannot escape extinction. He promises to be
their friend if they do right, but declares that he will aid in
inflicting prompt punishment upon the idle and vicious.</p>
<p>The message of the Governor to the Virginia Legislature urges the
avoidance of all legislation calculated unnecessarily to irritate she
people. He recommends fewer restrictions in the regulation of the
white elective franchise. As neither himself nor the Legislature has
the control of the negro suffrage, they will not deliberate on that
question. An extra Session of the Virginia Legislature was convened on
the 19th ult., at Richmond.</p>
<p>The Governor of Tennessee has ordered the election of a full
Congressional delegation.</p>
<p>Orders have been issued to dismantle the defensive works around
Washington, except twenty-two forts and three batteries, which will be
strengthened and permanently garrisoned.</p>
<p>The Government had ordered a further reduction of the army by
50,000 men.</p>
<p>The 25 per cent restriction duty on cotton west of the Mississippi
had been removed.</p>
<p>The country is now divided into five grand military divisions--the
Atlantic, under General Meade; the Mississippi, under Sherman; the
Tennessee, under General Thomas; the South-west, under General
Sheridan; and the Pacific, under General Halleck.</p>
<p>The grand jury of San Francisco has dismissed the complaint against
the parties charged with organising an expedition to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Breckenridge and six others reached Cuba, on the 11th ult.,
from the Florida coast. They crossed in an open boat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln has taken up her residence, for the summer, at Hyde
Park, six miles from Chicago.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seward, wife of Secretary Seward, has died of bilious fever,
at Washington.</p>
<p>A delegation of Poles has had an interview with President
Johnson. They say that 20,000 expatriated Poles desire to emigrate to
America. Efforts are being made to get them to settle in Virginia.</p>
<p>The reading of the argument for the defence, in the conspiracy
trials, was continued before the military court in Washington on the
21st ult. Mr. Doster, counsel for Payne and Atzerott, admitted the
guilt of Payne, but urged the Court to consider how far his punishment
should be mitigated on account of his manifest conviction that he was
doing right in attempting to kill Mr. Seward. Payne had, by reason of
his Southern education, his participation at a tender age in war, and
by his residence in districts wherein the Federal troops had caused
great devastation and suffering, become a deadly enemy to the
North. He had erroneously regarded Mr. Lincoln as a tyrant and
usurper, and Mr. Seward as a mortal enemy to the South and her
institutions, and he therefore believed himself right in attempting
his life. The accused was, in his guilt, only a consequence of the
evil teachings of slaveholders, and was no hired tool, but a fanatic,
an enthusiast, and a hero. Apart from his crime, which he (Mr. Doster)
abhorred, he saw much in Payne's character to admire. Mr. Doster
strongly urged the Court to consider the extenuating circumstances of
the case before pronouncing sentence, although the prisoner desired to
die, in the fanatical belief that, by suffering execution, he would
gain a crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In behalf of Atzerott, Mr. Doster claimed that the prisoner had,
although at first he considered Booth's propositions, finally shrank
from participation in their execution, merely maintaining an
appearance of co-operation therein to escape Booth's indignation.</p>
<p>An additional argument was read by Mr. Aiken in behalf of
Mrs. Surratt, and the Court adjourned. In consequence of her serious
illness, Mrs. Surratt has been removed from her cell to more
comfortable quarters in the penitentiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson has submitted an argument denying the
jurisdiction of the military court for the conspiracy
trial.</p></div2>

<p>Havannah advices announce the arrival of General John
C. Breckenridge in Cuba, after an adventurous voyage, in company with
six other persons, in an open boat, from the coast of Florida. The
persons accompanying General Breckenridge were Colonel Wilson, an aid
to Jefferson Davis, Captain Taylor Hood, formerly commander of the
Tallahassee; Corporal Russell, two Confederate private soldiers, and a
slave of Breckenridge's who refused to leave his master. General
Breckenridge and Colonel Wilson were within forty miles of Mr. Davis
when he was captured, and Captain Hood was actually with him, but
succeeded in making his escape, and on the following day joined
General Breckenridge, and the party at once started rapidly towards
the coast. Crossing Georgia into Florida they descended the St. John's
River in a boat to Jupiter's Inlet, where they met a party of Federal
deserters, from whom they secured a better boat, which they hauled
across the country to an inlet of the sea. After performing Divine
worship the little party launched their boat. They had a narrow escape
from capture on the first day of their voyage. They had beached their
boat on a sand-reef, some sixty miles from their point of departure,
in order to hunt shellfish, which, with Indian corn, constituted their
sole food on the voyage. A Federal steam-transport came in sight, and
a boat put off towards the reef. Captain Hood and the two privates met
the boat, some distance from the reef, and succeeded in convincing the
officer in charge that the party consisted of paroled soldiers, who
were looking down the coast for old wrecks, and they were left
unmolested. After a voyage of three, or, according to some accounts,
eight days, involving great exposure and privation, they reached
Cardenas, on June 11. They were very kindly received by the people,
and the authorities furnished them transportation to Havannah. Colonel
Helm, formerly United States Consul at Havannah, presented
Breckenridge to the Captain-General of the island, who received him
with cordial hospitality and great courtesy, and is said to have
assured him of a safe asylum in the island.</p></div2>

<p>On the 16th of June a stone monument, 27 ft. high, was erected,
with due ceremonial, on a crest a little south of Henry-house, "in
memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July 21, 1861." The spot
selected is where Heintzelman's division made their hardest fight, but
were finally driven back by Kirby Smith. A considerable force of
troops was on the ground, and a large company of civilians; proper
religious exercises were gone through, some addresses delivered, and
then a salute was fired by Captain Smith's Massachusetts battery on
the same spot where Rickett's battery was captured. The battle-field
itself presents few evidences of the engagement. Here and there a
mound indicates a grave, but they are not numerous; and the only relic
found was an old musket barrel.</p></div2>

Leeward Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, containing the richest natural
deposit of phosphate of lime at present known. The island was first
visited by an English gentleman about the year 1814, and again by him
in 1825, on which latter occasion a report was made to the British
Government, but did not meet with that consideration which subsequent
events prove it to have deserved. In 1856 the Americans took
possession of the island, and in the course of a very short time
exported to the extent of 100,000 tons of this valuable fertiliser, to
resuscitate the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Subsequently
their proceedings attracted the attention of a British surveying
expedition, at that time engaged in the West Indies, as may be learned
from a communication to the Royal Agricultural Society<pb n="18"/> of
England, by Sir Roderick Murchison, who, in describing the geological
structure of the island, says:--"I have often regretted that I have
never had it in my power to communicate anything of importance to the
British farmer; I am now, however, enabled to make an announcement
which will, I have no doubt, be as acceptable to agriculturalists as
it is likely to become very valuable to the merchant and shipowner."
It appears that the Americans have already quarried away a
considerable part of the island, and sold the substance in New
York. This transaction led to an official correspondence between the
British and American Governments, and eventually the right of the
British Crown to the possession of this valuable deposit was
acknowledged by the United States Government. Sir Roderick Murchison
considers our holding the Island of Sombrero to be of great national
importance, in providing our agriculturists, from a British
possession, with a plentiful supply of a good substitute for the guano
of Peru.</p></div2>

<p>....On Monday the new actor from America appeared at the New
Adelphi, in an American play and an American character. Mr. Owens
then, for the first time, presented himself before the British public,
and produced a new drama, entitled "Solon Shingle." The hero is an
American farmer who, in paying a visit to an American village, makes
himself at home wherever he is, and practises a familiarity so free
and easy that he scarcely recognizes any distinction between <hi
rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuum.</hi> The
nonchalance and provincialism of the character are very striking and
novel; the make-up is admirable. The old man toddles about, and
interferes in every thing, intruding himself into a merchant's store
at a late hour in the evening, and even into the Court of Justice,
standing up as a witness in a cause with which he had nothing to
do. In these different situations he spins a variety of yarns, in
which the most is made of nothing, the peculiarities of character
being brought out by minute details, which have no importance but as
they illustrate an individuality. Altogether, this is a remarkable
performance, and may make a sensation....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A "Shoddy" Millionaire At New York</hi>.--One
day, when Tommy was "doing" New York, he strode into Tiffany's
magnificent jewellery establishment, on Broadway, and startled the
assembled salesmen with a loud "Show us a diamond!""Here is one, Sir,"
responded an elegantly modulated voice from the "diamond department."
"Eighty dollars, Sir." "Pooh! not such a speck as that; something
bigger." "Allow me to show you this; very pure stone, Sir, 160 dols."
"Nonsense, bigger!" Herewith the gentlemanly salesman (who I have
always suspected to be a noble Lord in difficulties) produced the
brilliant of about the size of a small pea. "Exquisite stone, Sir;
first water, 800." "Look here!" cried Tommy, becoming exasperated, "If
you've got a reg'lar diamond, fetch it out; if you haven't, just say
so." My Lord, half amused, half vexed, here, by way of totally
annihilating his rough customer, brought out the Koh-i-noor of the
place. "Will this suit you, Sir? Moderately fine stone; price, 15,000
dols." "Now you're coming to it!" cried Tommy, decidedly
mollified. "Is this the tip-top biggest?" "It is, Sir," replied his
Lordship, coolly (stroking his beard at the same time, as if to say,
"Now, my rustic friend, I have wasted quite time enough upon you, you
may go.") "You ain't got nothin' bigger, now?" "Nothing, I assure
you." "Then I'll take it." M'Lord, I grieve to say, lost his presence
of mind, and stared; but Thomas at once produced a huge roll of
"greenbacks," counted out the money, and the sale was concluded. This,
as I have been told, occurred more than a year ago. Now, my Lord,
having become somewhat familiar with the ways and means of Shoddy,
would scarcely lift his eyelids were his coalheaver to propose to buy
out the entire concern.--<hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> for

<p>Sixteen years ago San Francisco was a petty hamlet, lying on the
sandy slope that curved its yellow crescent behind Clarke's Point. A
few whalers and United States men-of-war had touched there at long
intervals and an occsional merchant vessel had taken aboard a cargo of
hides and tallow. The interior was a <hi rend="italic">terra

and emigrants who had partly explored it. In one year after the
discovery of gold had become universally known San Francisco had a
population of about 30,000, and its harbour was filled with ships from
every quarter of the world. Ten years later its population had more
than doubled; and five years later it had nearly doubled again, being
hard on to 120,000.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RECONSTRUCTION, BRITISH AND<lb/>AMERICAN.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Great</hi> work of political reconstruction
is in mid progress in the United Kingdom. We are not, indeed,
refashioning our Constitution. The three estates of the realm, their
proper sphere and limits of action, their mutual duties and
responsibilities, remain what they have been, and are unchallenged by
public opinion. We are meddling with none of our great national
institutions. We are shifting nothing of importance from its ancient
basis. Nevertheless, we have been engaged throughout the week now
closing, and we shall be more or less generally engaged for the next
fortnight, in building up again that part of the machinery of
government which, because it bears the chief stress of legislation and
has a predominant influence on its character and results, is wisely
submitted to periodical renovation with a view to adapt it to such
change as may have passed upon the public mind. The Crown, acting in
conformity with law, has dissolved one House of Commons, and the
country is busy in putting together another. Strictly speaking, the
work is one of reconstruction, but reconstruction in an extremely
limited sense.</p>
<p>In the very thick of the turmoil inevitably occasioned by a general
election there is ground for satisfaction in the knowledge that the
process is attended with no danger. The legislative mechanism which on
Monday morning last was nonexistent, and which even yet is but half
refitted, will be framed on the same model, with two or three trifling
exceptions, as that which has served the use of the present
generation. Such alterations as are now being made will affect merely
the materials of which it is composed. The leading wheels and
principal levers in the machine will, for the most part, be replaced
from the old one. They will, no doubt, be cleansed of some of the
deposit which during six years' work has accumulated about them, and
which had helped somewhat to clog their movements. Friction against
the great outside public will, perhaps, rub away some soil and rust,
and fit them for accelerated action. But no great change is desired or
will be effected as regards them. In conjunction, however, with these
more important parts, there are a considerable number and variety of
minor pieces, all having something to do towards the general result,
and each susceptible, in doing it, of improvement or decay. It is here
that the chief alterations are to be expected. Old and untrustworthy
appliances, or, what in effect amounts to the same thing, those which
are thought to be such, will be cast aside for new and more promising
material. That which is suffered to remain will in many cases be
passed through the fire, hammered into more convenient forms, polished
and lubricated, and, refitted to its former place. There will be a
deal of scouring and cleaning, the substitution of not a little that
is untried for that which after trial is found wanting, and, it is to
be hoped, a general improvement of the machinery in regard to the
parts of which it is composed; but that will be the whole amount of
positive change accomplished or sought. There is nothing in all this
calculated to unsettle public confidence, nothing to excite misgivings
as to the future, no empiricism of which the most timid need to be
afraid.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not mean to imply that change even to this extent
may not or will not involve some change in the action of
Parliament. We shall not assume to judge what may be the character of
the future House of Commons, or what will be the drift of its
policy. Only events will bring either the one or the other fully into
light, But we do regard it as matter of satisfaction that, on the
whole, the process which is being now resorted to will tend rather to
abridge than to widen the distance between the legislatorial power and
the settled convictions<pb n="30"/> and will of the country. Whatever
these latter may prove to be, after the criticism, the siftings, and
the verdict of a general election, they may be embodied in law without
imperilling anything which commends itself to sound sense and just
feeling, and almost as certainly without producing so much as a jar
upon the nervous system of the community. We may anticipate just so
much expansion in the aims and proceedings of the Government as will
be rendered necessary by any expansion which has taken place in the
thoughts and wishes of the public. That is all; and that is an issue
to which every intelligent and well-trained mind will be content to
submit. So that, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
reconstruction is but a renovation of means and apparatus, with growth
as the result. The process is far from unimportant. Upon those who
conduct it rests a grave responsibility, but, at least, it is
unaccompanied by serious apprehensions for the future.</p>
<p>Our kinsmen on the other side of the Atlantic are also intent just
now upon the business of reconstruction--but under what different
circumstances and on how much wider a scale! Let it not be supposed
that we allude to the contrast for the sake of self-glorification--we
do so merely, with a view to deepen our own sense of
thankfulness. That they have to face and master, as we can hardly
doubt they will do, a much more searching and difficult problem than
ourselves, cannot be attributed to the superiority of our
qualifications, or of our mode of using them, in any respect. Our good
fortune is, that we long since passed through that stage of national
discipline which they have but just reached, and our hope is that they
will get through it without more permanent suffering than we. Still,
as a simple matter of fact, the processes which are at this moment
operative in the two countries differ so widely the one from the other
in depth, intensity, and duration, that one cannot help viewing then
side by side. The reconstructive work now absorbing the energies of
American statesmanship is not only difficult, but it touches close
upon several dangerous issues. Whereas, in our own case, the past, and
especially, the proximate past, is our mainstay, it is in theirs the
source of disquietude. They have to reconstitute the South, not merely
of new materials, bu after a new model. They have to lay again the
very foundations of society. The civil war has broken up the
pre-existing social system, and has pretty well levelled to the dust
the political edifice. It would seem impracticable to reconstruct the
latter in conformity with the provision of law, and, happily, as we
think, impossible, as well as impolitic, to base society on the
maintenance or rather the restoration of slavery. The consequence is
an immense amount of present confusion, collision, and misery--the
inevitable <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;bris</hi> of an armed conflict
on so gigantic a scale. Some time will be required before the dust and
smoke have sufficiently cleared away to allow of a definite plan being
adopted and brought into operation. Much suffering will, doubtless, be
endured meanwhile; but our Transatlantic cousins are not deficient in
a talent for organisation. We believe they will work out the questions
before them in much less time, and much more satisfactorily, than has
been generally expected, and that the social difficulty will, after
its first pressure, yield to the appliances which robust common-sense
will bring to bear upon it.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two countries at the present moment
suggests matter for profitable consideration. A theory has been
advanced by some, that no great nation can fully develop its
capabilities until it has passed through the ordeal of a civil war,
and that, in the course of its history, one such convulsive intestine
struggle is inevitable. We shall not discuss this theory, neither can
we assent to it. It may be true of certain stages of civilisation, but
we question whether it can be predicated as a law applicable to
nations which are, or will hereafter be, the growth of offshoots from
a population already educated and trained in the principles and
practice of self-government. Be this, however, as it may, every fresh
instance presented to us by history of the attainment of political and
social results by violent means makes us doubt whether the process be
not more costly than the end will repay, and whether the mischief done
by it be not so great that the time, the anxiety, the exertion, and
the self-sacrifice required for the work of reparation might not have
sufficed, if employed in conformity with law, to accomplish, within a
given period, all that may have been achieved by the sword, and
without anything like the attendant suffering. The upward and onward
destinies of a people are seldom, if ever, permanently hastened by
force. They are the result of moral culture, and in very few and
exceptional instances is moral culture quickened by the destruction of
property or the effusion of blood. The reconstruction rendered
necessary by mortal conflicts is always difficult, often
disappointing, and sometimes slower in arriving at its
consummation--namely, the settlement of the vital question in
dispute--than the patient use of milder methods would have been. We
may well be thankful that the business on which our fellow-countrymen
are now engaged is one which less than a month will be required to
effect, and which, when effected, will place the country a step in
advance; and we may sincerely sympathise with our American cousins
that their work does not more closely resemble ours in the ease and
certainty with which it may be dispatched. To bind up and heal deep
wounds is a serious affair--to wash and be refreshed is but a trifling
demand on exertion. Such, however, is the difference between what they
and we are engaged in doing at the present time.</p></div2>

<p>Telegrams from New York, to the 1st inst., state that the
conspiracy trial in Washington has been concluded. The Military
Commission has agreed upon the verdict, but it will not be made public
until after it has been either approved or rejected by the
President. The Judge-Advocate previously submitted an argument
asserting that four of the prisoners were fellow-conspirators with
Booth. He contended that the evidence showed that Davis, Sanders,
Tucker, and others, planned and assisted the assassination.</p>
<p>Owing to too close application to his duties, President Johnson has
been indisposed for several days past and unable to take part in
Cabinet meetings.</p>
<p>Colonel Mosby, the celebrated Confederate cavalry raider, has been
pardoned by the President, and has commenced practising law at
Culpepper, Virginia.</p>
<p>A deputation from South Carolina has had an interview with
President Johnson to request the appointment of a civil
governor. Johnson replied that no State would go out of the Union. He
must deal with restoration, not reconstruction. The people of South
Carolina could not be admitted to Congressional representation until
they called a convention and adopted the Federal and State
Constitutional Amendment abolishing slavery. He thought if negro
suffrage were now granted employers would control negro suffrage to
the detriment of the poor whites. He would, after consultation with
his Cabinet, consider the appointment of a governor.</p>
<p>President Johnson has ordered the military authorities at
Charleston not to prohibit political assemblages of coloured
people.</p>
<p>General Terry has issued an order at Richmond that the negroes will
enjoy the same personal liberty and be subject to the same restraints
as whites.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislature has adjourned, after extending the
franchise to those excluded by the Alexandria Constitution.</p>
<p>There have been serious affrays between the Federal soldiers and
the blacks at several places. At Norfolk the troops, aided by the
white inhabitants, had driven the negroes from the town. At Charleston
there had been a fight between the white and black soldiers, and
several were wounded on each side, At Savannah a New York regiment had
mutinied, and refused to do duty with the black troops; forty-three of
the mutineers had been apprehended, and imprisoned in Fort Pulaski. A

and coloured people. Many persons were wounded.</p>

rend="smallcaps">Of Bull Run.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> battles--that of July 21, 1861, and
that of Aug. 29, 1862--were fought between the Confederates and
Federals in the plain traversed by the small river called Bull Run,
which crosses the main road from Washington to Richmond, a few miles
north of Manassas Gap. The scene of the first conflict, one of the
earliest of the war in Virginia, would now scarcely be recognised as a
battle-field. Four years have obliterated nearly all the marks of the
struggle, and the relic-hunter only now and then finds in the grass a
memento of the event. Very few shot and shell remain upon the surface,
the trees are hiding the blotches on their trunks made by bullets, and
the only bones that are found, with few exceptions, are those of
horses, which visitors have not thought of sufficient importance to be
carried away. Some of the fences have been rebuilt, and corn is
planted in many places; while the rapidly-growing bushes hide nearly
all the original features of the field. The battle-field of Groveton,
two miles beyond, towards Warrenton, is more distinctly marked with
traces of battle. Here the shot and shell are thickly strewn, the
trees are splintered, and in many places the forest looks as if it had
been visited by smallpox. The bones of the soldiers of both armies are
scattered over the fields, and the phrenologist may find skulls
enough. A monument has now been erected on each of the Bull Run
battle-fields. These monuments are of chocolate-coloured, sandstone,
thirty feet high, and were erected by the officers and men of General
Gamble's separate cavalry brigade, camped at Fairfax Courthouse. The
monument on the first Bull Run field is situated on the hill in front
of the memorable stone house, on the spot where the 14th Brooklyn, 1st
Michigan, and 1st and 2nd Maine were most hotly engaged, and where
Ricketts and Griffin lost their batteries. The shaft is 27 ft. high,
and bears upon its top a hundred-pound shell. On the pedestal, at each
corner, is a shell of similar size. On one side of the shaft is
inscribed, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July
21st, 1861," and on the reverse, "erected June 10th, 1865." The
monument at Groveton is similar in its proportions, bearing the
inscription, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Groveton,
August 29, 1862," and on the reverse, "Erected June 10th, 1865." Our
Illustration represents the scene at the consecration, or
"dedication," as it is called in America, of these monuments. The
religious exercises were conducted on the first Bull Run field by the
Rev. Dr. M'Murdy, who read an appropriate service, which was followed
by a hymn written for the occasion by Pierpont; a military parade by
the 5th Pennsylvania heavy artillery, Colonel Gallup; and a salute by
the 16th Massachusetts battery, Captain Scott. At the close of these
ceremonies, eloquent addresses were delivered by Judge Olin, General
Wilcox, General Heintzelman, and General Farnsworth. At the second
monument the services were similar to those described. A large party
of visitors had come from Washington to be present on this
occasion.</p></div2>

<p>The assasination trials are over, and the sentences partly carried
out. Payne, Harrold, Atzerott, and Mrs. Surratt were hanged on the 7th
inst. The Judge of the Supreme Court had previously served a writ of
habeas corpus on General Hancock, in Mrs. Surratt's case, which, by
President Johnson's order, was not obeyed. It is stated that Payne,
previous to his execution, exonerated Mrs. Suratt, and that another
person had subscribed to an affidavit impeaching the testimony of an
important witness against her. Dr. Mudd, Arnold, and O'Laughlin are to
be imprisoned, with hard labour, for life; and Spangler, the stage
carpenter, is to be imprisoned, with hard labour, for six years.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia the Provost Marshal having, by order from
Washington, surrendered a prisoner named Cozzens to the Sheriff, Judge
Thompson has since released him, declaring that the President's power
to suspend the habeas corpus conferred by Congress terminated with the
war.</p>
<p>President Johnson's health is somewhat improved, but he is still
unable to receive visitors. The health of Mr. F. W Seward continues to
improve.</p>
<p>Independence Day, the 4th of July, was celebrated with more than
usual demonstrations of loyalty.</p>
<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation appointing Benjamin
F. Perry Provisional Governor of South Carolina. All the seceded
States, except Florida, have now either provisional or elected local
governments. The details of reconstruction, however, are much more
copious than interesting.</p>
<p>General Grant authorizes the statement that all the white volunteer
troops of the army would be mustered out of service at the earliest
possible day. It was probable that, by the middle of August, there
would not be 10,000 remaining in the whole of General Meade's military
division of the Atlanta.</p>
<p>Advices from the west report the capture of several desperate
guerrillas and murderers.</p>
<p>The military authorities of Richmond had taken precautionary
measures against an apprehended negro insurrection.</p>
<p>The Government are making arrangements to send to Atalanta a
sufficient quantity of supplies to relieve the necessities of the
people in that district, who for some time past had been reduced to
the last extremities of famine.</p>
<p>A committee of delegates, presenting the coloured population of
Virginia, was to meet in Alexandria on the 2nd of August, to consider
the condition and prospects of the race.</p>
<p>The number of applicants to the President for pardon average
between 200 and 300 a day. Papers were issued one day granting pardon
to 180, mostly North Carolinians.</p>
<p>The States of Wisconsin and Iowa have been visited by terrible
tornadoes. The village of Virogna, Vernon County, Wisconsin a place of
about 1200 inhabitants, was nearly destroyed. Seventeen persons were
killed and more than a hundred badly injured. The loss of property was
very great. In Iowa the crops were badly damaged, railroads and
bridges destroyed, and serious damage done in several counties. Heavy
rains succeeding had caused disastrous floods.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Federal troops were landing along the Texas coast
and the mouth of the Rio Grands. Six thousand troops, mostly coloured,
had arrived at Brazos. A detachment had been sent up the river, and
occupied Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> states that the Government had

<p>The Great Eastern, laden with the Atlantic telegraph cable, left
the Nore last Saturday evening, and arrived off Valencia on Wednesday
morning. The Caroline, with the shore end of cable, twenty-seven miles
in length, was detained at Falmouth by bad weather until Monday, and
had to be taken in tow by the Great Eastern off Land's-end the same
day, and taken to Valencia during a heavy sea. The Terrible and the
Sphynx are also off Valencia. In consequence of a heavy rolling sea,
the Great Eastern was unable to communicate with the shore, and went
for shelter to Berehaven Harbour, Bantry Bay, where she will lie until
the shore end of the cable is laid--an operation which will occupy
about two days, and which was to be set about directly the weather
improved. Once started for the Newfoundland coast, the only danger to
be feared i a storm severe enough to drive the Great Eastern from her
course. Messages will be transmitted from the ship on paying out each
fifty miles, so that the public will be able to watch her course from
day to day almost as closely as those on board. On arriving at
Newfoundland a message, already prepared, will be transmitted to the
directors, and the receipt of ths will be considered proof that the
line has been opened.</p></div2>

rend="smallcaps">Government.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> published at a somewhat late
period, the series of four Illustrations which we give this week
cannot fail to prove of much interest to our readers. It must be taken
into consideration that our Special Artist at the head-quarters of the
Southern army had numerous difficulties to contend with in the
transmission of his correspondence to this Journal; and it is only now
that, by his arrival in this country, we are placed in a position to
avail ourselves of the last of his experiences in the Southern States
of America.</p>
<p>After the capitulation of General Johnston there was virtually no
armed force left east of the Mississippi; and President Davis, already
a fugitive from Richmond, having been driven from the capital of
Virginia by the surrender of General Lee, found himself again a
wanderer by the wayside, seeking some means of escape from the Federal
columns which were closing in upon him in all directions. Our Special
Artist, as we have already stated, accompanied Mr. Davis in his flight
to within forty-eight hours of his capture. A few of the sketches he
made, while following the ex-President, are now given to the
public.</p>
<p>One of these Illustrations shows the ex-President's train crossing
the Pe-Dee River, in North Carolina. This was a long and tedious
operation. There are usually no bridges over the swift watercourses in
this part of America, and very frequently no fords. Each waggon, with
its team of mules, had in this instance to be ferried across
separately, and this delay, with an enemy following in the rear, was,
to say the least of it, a very anxious affair. In fact, more than one
alarm of the approach of the Federal cavalry was given before half the
train had crossed the river, and the excitement amongst the rearguard
and teamsters was excessive. The horses of the cavalry escort were
made to swim the stream, being stripped of their saddles and their
riders of most of their clothes. The confusion at the landing-place
was enormous, as many of the frightened animals were scarcely in the
water before they threw their riders and struggled to the bank,
charging through the crowd of attendant cavalrymen. Notwithstanding
all this, the entire train passed safely over the Pe-Dee and many
other streams while our Artist was in its company, and the only
misfortune that happened to him was two or three good duckings.</p>
<p>Another Illustration shows Mr. Davis and his Cabinet halting by
the roadside; the ex-President engaged in signing papers which
Mr. Benjamin, his Secretary of State, is handing to him. This was
probably the last official business transacted by the Confederate
Cabinet, and may well be termed "Government by the roadside." Our
readers must bear in mind that at any moment the alarm might be given
of the enemy's advance, and, to say the least, such a condition of
matters was scarcely calculated to give calmness to the deliberations
of the fugitive Government.</p>
<p>The subject of another Illustration is the scene presented by a
sudden alarm, or stampede, which was a very frequent occurrence, owing
to the proximity of the Federal cavalry, who were frequently within
three miles of the camp of the flying President. A scout had only to
dash in and give the alarm when everything went helter-skelter along
the road--President, Ministers cavalrymen, four-muled waggons, and
terrified negro servants, all jumbled up together.</p>
<p>The last of these Illustrations shows the farewell of Mr. Davis to
his escort and staff in the square of Washington, Georgia. It was here
that he determined to continue his flight almost alone; and,
assembling those round him who had sacrificed everything to the
defeated cause, he, with tears in his eyes, begged them to seek their
own safety and leave him to meet his fate. Undoubtedly, it was an
ill-advised arrangement which brought an escort of 1500 men in the
train of a man fleeing for his life; and, when too late, Mr. Davis saw
the error of thus attracting the attention of the entire country
through which he passed, and disbanded them but forty-eight hours
before his capture.</p></div2>

<p>....And so the Great Eastern is fairly off, and if in the ensuing
fortnight the telegraph cable is successfully laid down, amongst the
earliest news that runs along the line at the rate of four words a
minute will be that which relates the trial of Mr. Jefferson
Davis. There is now plenty of force in America, and the admirers of
Mr. Carlyle and a strong Government have their wish. No one can look
at a photograph of President Johnson without seeing that he is a man
of great capacity and of iron will. By-the-way, with what fervour
would the news be received, in America (were it only true) of the
assertion that Carlyle had undertaken the Life of President
Lincoln. "Two men I honour," said that writer; "and no third: first,
the toil-worn craftsman that conquers the earth. Venerable to me is
thy hard hand, hardly-entreated brother! The second is the inspired
thinker....These two, in all their degrees, I honour; all else is
chaff and dust." "Unspeakably touching" is the Carlylese expression
for the effect the sight of the two labourers united in one person has
on him; and in Abraham Lincoln, the eloquent rail-splitter and the
martyred President, surely these were so. The life of a mad despot
like Frederick might possibly be atoned for by the really deeply
instructive life of Abraham Lincoln. Will Mr. Carlyle take it in
hand?</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Things</hi> are looking favourable for the
Atlantic Telegraph. The shore end of the cable was successfully landed
at Valencia on Saturday morning last. Connections were made with the
instrument room at 12.45 p.m., Greenwich time, in the presence of a
large concourse. The Knight of Kerry and Sir Robert Peel made
congratulatory speeches. Three cheers were given for her Majesty and
three for the President of the United States. The paying-out of the
heavy shore cable, twenty-seven miles in length, was completed by the
Caroline late in the evening. Shortly after four, on Sunday<pb
n="83"/> afternoon, the splice with the main cable on board the Great
Eastern was completed, and the paying-out began from the Great
Eastern. Disquieting rumours were circulated on Tuesday to the effect
that the cable was in danger of failure. We are glad, however, to
learn that the hitch which occurred had been put right, and that at
the time of our going to press all was working smoothly. Telegrams
continue to be received from the gentlemen on board the Great Eastern,
signalling that the work of laying the cable is proceeding
satisfactorily; and this gigantic vessel, herself one of the wonders
of the world, which is bearing across the Atlantic the wire that is to
make thought simultaneous in the two hemispheres, has so far advanced
on her voyage that we may indulge in hopes of its successful
issue.</p>

<p>Silver Peak is believed to be as pre-eminent over all silver
mountains as the Iron Mountain of Missouri is superior to all other
iron deposits. Silver Peak is situated east of San Francisco, on the
eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, and nearly one degree south of the
city of Austin. It is some two miles from Castle Mount, an old extinct
crater, about 5000 ft. above ocean level. Near Silver Peak is an
extensive deposit of salt, and not far distant a hill of pure
sulphur. The whole country has a naked appearance, being quite
destitute of vegetation, and bristles with mountains scattered over a
plain of great extent. The dreaded "Valley of Death," upon the plains
of which, along the "old Spanish trail," travellers have suffered so
much, lies but a short distance to the south-east of the crater of
Silver Peak. Little Salt Lake, in Southern Utah, lies directly east of
Silver Peak. At first the searchers after deposits of the precious
metals confined their searches to the Pacific side of the Sierra
Nevada; but discoveries in New Mexico, Arizona, and Virginia city
induced a thorough examination of the east side of the Sierra
Nevada. This resulted in great success, the most brilliant of which is
found in the neighbourhood of Austin, on the line of the great
overland mail, where a city has sprung up within three years which,
Senator Nye says, contains a population of 10,000. From along this
line of exploration the miners are rapidly extending their operations,
both north and south. Recently (within six months) they came upon this
immense deposit near Castle Mount. Twelve exceedingly rich lodes, or
"ledges" as the miners call them, were discovered on that single
mountain. This discovery in an unexpected region is believed to be the
most valuable yet developed. The specimens--a great number of which
have been brought to New York by Colonel Catherwood--are certainly
very remarkable, and merit the attention of the whole financial
community. If there is no mistake--and with the specimens actually
before us we do not see how there can be--a new deposit, superior even
to the Comstock lode, which has furnished so many millions of silver,
is about to pour into our market its limitless supply of this precious
metal.--<hi rend="italic">New York Journal of Commerce.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAYING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the Supplement to this Number,...we
have given an account of all the operations connected with it till the
afternoon of Sunday, the 23rd ult., when the Great Eastern, having
joined the main length to the shore-end of the cable, twenty or thirty
miles from the Irish coast, started on her voyage across the
Atlantic. Next day, as we mentioned in our last week's Paper, a
telegraphic message was received from the Great Eastern, then lying
to, in lat. 52, long. 10, about eighty miles from shore, to say that
some defect had been found in the insulation of the telegraphic
wire. This mischief was supposed to exist about two or three miles
west of the shore-end of the splice, and it was believed to be caused
by the Great Eastern pulling on her end of the cable with too much
strain before the shore-end splice was properly completed. The time at
which this message was sent from the Great Eastern was half-past four
on the Monday afternoon. There was no apprehension expressed regarding
the complete and immediate repair of the damage, and the signals to
the telegraph-house at Valencia continued very distinct. The Hawk was
sent out that evening to go to the Great Eastern and see what was the
matter, while the Caroline was made ready to pick up the splice, if
needful, and repair the fault. Next day a telegram from Mr. Glass, at
Valencia, announced that "the cable was all right; there had been a
hitch, but all was now right." The Great Eastern, being in lat. 52,
long. 12, telegraphed on that day (Tuesday, the 25th) that "a small
fault had been discovered and cut out; she was now paying out again,
and the signalling was perfect; the weather very fine." The nature of
the accident was further explained next day when the Hawk had returned
to Valencia. In cutting off the loose ends of the twisted iron wires,
which form the external covering of the cable, a tiny shred of such
wire had been allowed to adhere to the composition which surrounds the
central electric wire at the core of the cable, and having come in
contact with the latter, had partially destroyed its insulation. This
piece of the cable, however, being submerged at a depth of not more
than two miles, could be raised again withoat much difficulty, and,
the faulty part having been cut out, a fresh splice could be made. On
the Wednesday morning the managing director at Valencia made the
following announcement:--</p>
<q><p>The Great Eastern telegraphs that the distance run at 9.50
a.m. today was 150 miles (nautical). The length of cable paid out at
6.50 a.m. was 150 miles (nautical). The signals are perfect. Weather
very fine.</p></q>
<p>At half-past seven on the same (Wednesday) evening, he again
reported, "All well. Two hundred miles of cable were paid out from the
Great Eastern at 8 p.m. to-day. All well."</p>
<p>The following despatches have since been published, from Thursday
week to last Thursday:--</p>

<p>....<hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> is scarcely so interesting as
usual, though it has some valuable papers. The most important is
Mr. Ludlow's sketch of the Presidents of the United States, somewhat
one-sided in its appreciations, but as lively and vigorous as most of
the productions of this very earnest writer. Jefferson scarcely
receives justice; the recent reaction in favour of the long-neglected
Hamilton having naturally operated disadvantageously to the statesman
who represented the opposite order of ideas. Both were eminent men;
but it is Jefferson's glory to have comprehended the genius of
republican institutions, while his rival scarcely disguised his
preference for a limited monarchy. The practical good sense of the
American people soon ascertained which of them was to be trusted, and
we have no doubt that its verdict will be ultimately confirmed by
posterity. Mr. Ludlow makes a strange mistake in calling President
Adams a Calvinist: he was precisely the reverse. Professor Cairnes, in
his paper on negro suffrage, discusses the most difficult question of
contemporary American politics. It is certain that the President
cannot confer the franchise on negroes without a violation of law, and
it remains for the advocates of the measure to show that such an
infringement is demanded by an imperious necessity. Professor Cairnes
argues the question very forcibly; but it is one that can only be
determined after the most mature consideration. The existence of such
difficulties is President Johnson's sufficient justification for
continuing to keep a tight grasp on the leading men of the
south....</p></div2>

<p>....As most of our readers are probably aware, the shore-end of the
cable, extending 27 miles from land on this side of the ocean, was
manufactured separately from the main length of 2300 miles, by
Mr. W. T. Henley, of North Woolwich, and was conveyed to Valencia by a
vessel belonging to him, the screw-steamer Caroline, which the
Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company had chartered for that
portion of the work. This piece of the cable is the largest and
heaviest ever made, weighing above twenty tons to the mile, and
measuring 2&#x00BD; in. in diameter, at the shore end, but diminishing
gradually, in the last 500 yards outwards, to the ordinary size of the
main deep-sea cable, with which it has been joined. The core or heart
of it is a cable precisely similar to the main length, but wrapped up
in jute yarn, and covered outside by a winding of twelve strands of
galvanised iron wires, three wires to the strand, and each wire a
quarter of an inch thick. Its strength is estimated as equal to a
breaking-strain of ninety tons. Such is the shore-end cable....the
voyage of the Caroline to Valencia, burdened with this cumbrous
section of the telegraphic line, seems to have been the most
difficult and hazardous task that has yet been performed in the whole
progress of the undertaking. the Great Eastern, with the main length
of 2300 miles of cable stowed in three iron tanks, as lately
described--making, with 7000 tons of coal and her other stores, an
aggregate burden of 24,000 tons--left her anchorage at the Nore<pb
n="123"/> on Saturday, July 15; and, with her insufficient
steam-power, had enough to do in getting down the Channel, by screw
and paddles, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but, when she
came off the Land's End; on the Monday, she found the Caroline, which
had started ten days before, and had lain weather-bound a week in
Falmouth Harbour, unable to proceed without help. The Great Eastern
was then obliged to take the Caroline in tow, from the Monday to the
Wednesday morning, against a rough south-westerly wind and the
tremendous swell of the open Atlantic, which, though scarcely felt by
the huge Great Eastern, almost overwhelmed the unhappy Caroline. There
was real danger of her being swamped, or rather dragged under the sea,
as she went round the south coast of Ireland on the Tuesday night, the
waves continually dashing over her decks from stem to stern, so that
the men on deck were up to their waists in water. The officers and
crew, who might have relieved themselves by casting off the tow-rope,
endured this severe trial rather than fail to perform their part of
the great work; but it must be considered that the Caroline was ill
chosen for this service, and that, with better arrangements, the
shore-end cable should have been safe at Valencia some time before the
Great Eastern set forth. As it happened, the tow-rope accidentally
breaking when a few miles off the Skelligs Rocks, at five o'clock on
the Wednesday morning, the Great Eastern first arrived alone at
Valencia, which is about twenty miles distant, and the Caroline made
her way in as soon as she could in the forenoon of that day. The Great
Eastern, after landing two or three of the official gentlemen
concerned in the enterprise went into Bearhaven, in Bantry Bay, where
she was to lie securely till the Caroline should have completed the
laying of the shore end, in readiness to meet the Great Eastern and to
form the junction with the main length of cable some twenty or thirty
miles out at sea.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern was accompanied by H.M.S. Terrible and Sphinx,
which met her at Valencia, and are to keep with her in her voyage to
Newfoundland. It should have been mentioned above that the Great
Eastern was assisted likewise in her start from the Nore by another of
the Queen's ships, the surveying-steamer Porcupine under
Staff-Commander Calver, by whose guidance she was enabled to pass
through a deep channel, recently explored and very seldom used, much
more convenient for her than either the Swin or the Alexandra channel,
ordinarily frequented by vessels leaving the Thames or Medway for the
North Sea. But we must return to the Caroline, where we left her, at
Foilhommerum in Port Magee, a narrow inlet of the strait which
separates the Isle of Valencia from the neighbouring coast of Kerry to
the south. To that remote part of the United Kingdom, thirty or forty
miles west of Killarney, had the Telegraph Construction Company
suddenly removed the scene of its operations, which we noticed so
lately at East Greenwich and in the Medway prosperously carried
forward under the eye of the London world; yet, by means of the pens
of the reporters...the public are now made acquainted with the
minutest details of this mighty work.</p>
<p>The road to Valencia, either from Killarney or from Kenmare and
Glengariff, at the head of Bantry Bay, was travelled not without some
delays by the few persons from London who, having made the best of
their way to see the landing of the cable, succeeded in getting there
on the morning of Saturday week. The local staff of the Telegraph
Construction Company had been engaged for some weeks past in various
preparations on the spot. An encampment of the workmen was here or
there to be seen along the road....These tents are pitched by the
side of the road which passes along the shore of Dingle Bay towards
Cahirciveen, at the foot of the Keragh mountains. The central figure
in our Artist's sketch is Mr. Watlock, the superintendent of the works
of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, to whom belongs the line connecting
Valencia with the telegraphic system throughout Ireland. The poles on
which the wire is stretched have, for the most part, been replaced by
new and larger ones. It happened, rather unluckily, that one of these
poles had been knocked down, some say by "an impulsive Irish cow,"
others by a drunken Irish car-driver, on the very day the cable was
landed, so that the news could not be transmitted to us in London
quite so quickly as we should have been glad to receive it, but this
defect was soon repaired.</p>
<p>...[T]he actual landing of the cable from the ship Caroline [took
place] in the small haven at Foilhommerun....This place lies just
under and within Bray Head, the mountain promontory which forms the
south-west corner of the Isle of Valencia, projecting into the
Atlantic Ocean. It is distant six or seven miles across the island
from Knightstown, the port, which occupies a position on the strait
like that of Sonderburg in the Isle of Alsen....A contemporary
reporter gives this description of the scenery:--"We now reach nearly
at the summit of the last hill a low wooden hut, painted black, and
not unlike the summer establishment of some watering-place
photographer. This is the temporary office of the Atlantic Telegraph
Company. Along the waste land, at some distance to the right, are half
a dozen thatched hovels, while a few feet from the grass-grown
turf-wall which divides the field containing this office from the
cliff, you look down upon the Caroline, which is in communication with
the land by a lengthy floating bridge of boats. To the right and left
precipitous rocks rise nearly 300 ft. from the sea, so hollowed at
each side as to give to the securely-sheltered little haven, which is
scarcely a mile from end to end, the conformation of a
horseshoe. Rugged, steep, and utterly inaccessible, save where a rude
and broken path has been formed by the cablemen, these cliffs are
studded with wild flowers and ferns, and variegated by large patches
of the brightest verdure, which alternate with masses of tangled
seaweed and huge blocks of slate and parti-coloured rock. Butler's
Island, a large grass-grown strip of stony ground stretching from left
to right, from the far point of the bay, lessens the opening to the
sea, and materially helps to shelter this beautiful nook, though, as
there is of course neither land nor breakwater between its entrance
and America, it will be readily understood that in rough weather it
presents a very different appearance to the one it wore
yesterday. Then all was smiling, sunny, and calm. The spectator who,
after drinking in the beauties before him from the heights, scrambled
down the rugged path and stood among the men hauling the cable on
shore, or balanced himself on one of the crags arresting his downward
path, was in a magnificent natural amphitheatre, with toiling
peasants, earnest savans, excited seamen, and eager capitalists for
his actors--priests, local gentry, electricians, and telegraphists for
his fellow lookers-on, and the broad Atlantic for his
stage. Mr. Creswick never surpassed the rich hues and bright tints of
the rocks and vegetation around; Frith never painted brighter eyes,
more supple figures, or more picturesquely artistic costumes than
those of the barefooted nymphs assembled to look at Pat or Mike
'helping the tiligraph gintlemin;' Stanfield never transferred to
canvas a more beautiful and varied sea-piece than the one before
us. On the highest pinnacle of the cliff, to the right, the country
people had planted a succession of improvised flags, consisting of
coloured pocket-handkerchiefs, scarlet cloaks, blankets, petticoats,
and what not, which fluttered gaily in the breeze, while all round the
summit a long fringe of lookers-on stood out sharp and clear against
the blue sky, some mounted, some squatted on the ground, dudheen in
mouth, some gesticulating in little groups, and all manifesting the
keenest interest in the proceedings of the day. The peasant's notion
of the mysterious wire is that it will somehow bring him nearer to the
land of promise. Every Irish labourer tells you of the relatives or
friends who have prospered in America; and no man or woman here seems
too old or feeble to hope for the day when their savings will amount
to 'five or six pounds, yer honour,' that they may bid the old country
good-by and begin the world anew. The telegraphic colours, represented
by rosettes of red, white, and blue, made and presented by Lady Capel
Molyneux, decorated the coats or hats of those immediately interested
in the enterprise; and, out of the three or four hundred employed on
the boats and shore to assist in hauling the cable in, it is scarcely
necessary to say no two figures were attired alike. The high-collared,
swallow-tailed blue coat--new, perhaps, before the electric telegraph
was invented, and sadly soiled and threadbare now--worked side by side
with the ragged nondescript garment which had been fustian, but had
reached the stage of hardly-kept-together tatters. Shirts which
blushed darkly at being exposed; jersies blue, red, and brown; caps
and hats of every variety and shape; bare heads, bare legs, and feet,
and arms made up the line. The boats were similarly manned, and
continued this line from the stern of the Caroline, some 700 yards
off, so that the cable was passed literally from hand to hand from
ship to shore." The appearance of this long row of boats was very
striking, and they varied from the smart cutters of the ships and the
trim gig of the coastguard to the ordinary fishing-boat of the
coast. Besides those which formed the line, having eight or ten men,
labourers or fishermen, in each boat, to hand the cable along, there
were detached boats passing up and down, with the experienced persons
who were to direct the landing--about thirty-five boats in all. On
shore, where a trench, 2ft. deep, had been cut across the narrow beach
and up the face of the cliff, to receive the cable, a hundred or more
of the country people, encouraged by the presence of their popular
landlord, Mr. Fitzgerald, the Knight of Kerry, were pulling and
shouting in their Irish fashion, with the utmost enthusiasm, but with
less discretion--for, not being aware that it was necessary to bring
in and lodge upon the beach a certain quantity of cable in excess of
the distance from the ship to the shore, in order that it might be
passed up the cliff and across a couple of fields to the Telegraph
House, these Irishmen, as soon as they got hold of the end of the
future line of communication with America, threw it upon the ground,
and raised a wild "Hurroo!" This was caught and repeated by the crews
of the boats, who, concluding that their work was well done, at once
proceeded to heave the massive rope into the sea. From boat to boat
the first bad example was followed by all until to the dismay of the
cablemen, who could not gain a hearing amid the continued cheers,
every fathom up to the stern of the Caroline was thrown overboard. The
result of this touching enthusiasm was that every foot had to be
underrun, preparatory to the whole operation beginning <hi
rend="italic">de novo</hi>. It took some time to effect this, during
which the Irish were silent enough.</p>
<p>"When the cable bad been underrun, hauled into the boats again, and
the shore end really began to come on land, and was stowed away in
gigantic circles at the foot of the cliff, the scene was one of
extraordinary animation. Numbers of men were in the water to their
waists or shoulders easing the cable over the rocks, while along the
steep path up the cliff was a close row of figures, men and boys, of
every rank, from the well-to-do farmer down to the poorest cottier,
all pulling at the cable with a will, and, as if in atonement for
their first fault of enthusiasm, obeying with silent and almost
childlike docility every signal made by Mr. Glass or Mr. Canning as to
when they were to haul or slack away." Mr. Temple, assistant to
Mr. Canning, with another of the staff, was in the water up to his
neck working as hard as any. By twelve o'clock the cable was well up
the groove which had been cut in the face of the cliff for its
reception; and from this point the work of carrying its massive coils
across the meadows to the Telegraph House was soon accomplished; and
at a little before one o'clock the end, taken over roads, hedges, and
ditches, was brought close up to the house, or hut, a plain wooden
building, already mentioned....Here several of the gentlemen
chiefly<pb n="124"/> interested in the great enterprise were
assembled, with Sir Robert Peel, Chief Secretary to the Government of
Ireland, and Lord John Hay, who had both come with the Knight of
Kerry, having, as well as Mr. Glass, the managing director of the
Telegraph Construction Company (and manufacturer of the main length of
cable) been the guests of the Knight of Kerry, at his mansion of
Glenleam, Knightstown. The simple ceremony with which the cable was
introduced to the telegraph station has not been noticed by other
reporters, but our Artist says, "The end of the cable was taken up by
Mr. Glass and handed to Sir Robert Peel, who passed it through ahole
left for the purpose in the building which forms, pro tem, the
station, where it was speedily connected with the batteries in the in
instrument-room. A signal was then interchanged with the Caroline,
proving that the electric communication was perfect. Three cheers for
the Queen were called for meanwhile, and given with Irish warmth. The
Knight of Kerry briefly addressed the large concourse of ladies and
gentlemen, yeomen and peasantry, now gathered about him. He expressed
his gratification at this auspicious commencement of the work, and
called for three cheers for the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, and three
cheers for Sir Robert Peel. These were most heartily given, and, of
course, were followed by a speech from Sir Robert Peel. He spoke, with
his wonted energy, of the political, social, and commercial benefits
which would be secured if the cable should prove successful; and,
after invoking the aid of Divine Providence, called for three cheers
for the Queen and three for Mr. Glass. In replying, Mr. Glass said
that all human skill could achieve had been applied to the furtherance
of the object, which he hoped was now near its consummation. Sir
R. Peel, having called for three cheers for the President of the
United States, and the Doxology having been sung, Mr. Glass formally
announced the success of the test that had been just applied, and then
the men returned to the beach and filled in the trench in which the
cable lay. Soon after twelve the Hawk arrived from Knightstown, and
towed the Caroline out of the bay to lay the cable, which was done
slowly but safely, under the able superintendence of Mr. Canning,
chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company,
assisted by Mr. Henley and Captain White, the officer commanding the
Coastguard stations along this coast, and who has devoted much care
and attention to obtaining correct soundings along the route to be
taken by the shore end. The Caroline started from the bay at 2.10
p.m. (Irish time)....Telegrams were constantly received from the
Caroline at Foilhommerum station, showing that all was going on
well....It was nearly twelve o'clock at night when a message was
received by Mr. Glass that the Caroline had laid the whole of the
shore-end cable with perfect success, and that its electric continuity
was quite perfect.</p>
<p>On the next day (Sunday week) the operation of joining the shore
end of the cable to the main length was performed at about fifteen
miles beyond the most western of the rugged rocks on the coast of
Ireland. Here the Great Eastern, attended by the Terrible and Sphinx,
was approached by the Caroline, bearing the last half mile of the
shore end. The spectators of the work were on board the Hawk, a
steam-yacht belonging to Mr. Glass, which came upon the scene as the
cable was being drawn from the stem of the Great Eastern to the
Caroline. Among those on board the Hawk were Lord John Hay; Sir
R. Peel, M.P.; the Knight of Kerry, with his daughters, the Misses
Fitzgerald; Captain White, R.N.; and Captain Hamilton; with Mr. W. H,
Russell and Mr. Robert Dudley, who are appointed to be the historian
and the artistic illustrator of the voyage of the Great Eastern across
the Atlantic....Soon after one o'clock the coils of the deep-sea cable
were safely wound on board the Caroline, and the work of splicing them
at once commenced. This was done by stripping both ends of hemp,
outside wires, and gutta-percha for a short distance, till the copper
conductor of the line was laid bare, and pared down to a fine
wedge-shaped point at each end. The connecting conductors were then
overlapped in the form known as a "scarf" joint, and firmly bound
together with fine threads of copper wire, till the junction was made
even stronger than the main portions of the line. The threads and
conductor were then soldered together thickly, and strips of soft
gutta-percha, like bands of brown tape, were wound layer over layer,
and their edges closely pressed, so as to form one homogeneous mass;
till a certain thickness was completed. Then came a coating of
insulated material called Chatterton's compound, and then again
another layer of gutta-percha tape, until the whole was inclosed in
four rings of the gutta-percha and three of the compound. The joint
was then immersed in cold water for testing, and, the signals proving
perfect, the last protection of hemp and outside wire was added, and
the joint sunk again into the sea, that its perfectness as to
conductivity and insulation might be ascertained from the extreme end
of the whole length of the cable on board the Great Eastern. It was
past four o'clock before the last of these tests was concluded, and in
every case they proved to be most satisfactory. At 4.30 the signal was
given and the last fastenings which held it to the Caroline were cast
adrift, and, with a great splash, the final joint of the Atlantic
telegraph and the first thirty miles of its length went down slowly
into the blue water, the depth here being 100 fathoms. The Hawk then
gave the Great Eastern a parting cheer; the Great Eastern fired a
salute of three guns, took a turn ahead, and was fairly off; floating
from her trunks she bore the white jack, an American ensign, the
burgee of the company--the union jack and American stars quartered,
together, the words "Atlantic Telegraph" being on the tail; a red
ensign, a union jack, and the French flag; and from her peak the blue
ensign, which she flies because Captain Anderson is an officer of the
naval reserve. In the five ships thus lying near together all the
British ensigns were used, the Caroline having red, the Great Eastern
and the Hawk blue, the latter because she ranks as a yacht, and the
two men-of-war white. Just before the start, the Captain of the
Terrible, who was on board the Great Eastern, consulting with Captain
Anderson, retired to his own ship, which presently took her place on
the starboard quarter of the big vessel, the Sphinx taking the port
quarter; and so they went away to the West. The Caroline had before
this turned her head to the shore, and now the Hawk followed, and soon
caught her; the Great Eastern and the men-of-war, which had been
passing out of sight on the horizon, were by this time discernible
only by the bank of cloudlike smoke which lay in the golden pathway of
the setting sun....</p></div2>
