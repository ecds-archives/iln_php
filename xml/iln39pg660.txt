<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1861.</hi>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> a few days from the time of our publication England will, in all probability, bemade aware of the intentions of the American Government. If Mr. Lincoln has the courage to act up to his own convictions, and to defy the menaces of an infuriated mob, Messrs. Mason and Slidell are by this time on their way to our shores. But we have no great hope that such will be the freight of the vessel now hastening to Liverpool. It is true that ultimately the Government that shall provoke a contest with England will go down in disgrace when the ignorant and angry myriads who now denounce us are excited to frenzy by the chastisement which, in the event of war, England will inflict. It is true that, in the presence of disasters, no American Government, save that of military despotism, will be able to endure; and therefore that it is a choice of evils which the Lincoln Cabinet has before it. But with a certain class of minds the immediate danger is always more terrible than the remote one, and these are the chances for Messrs. Lincoln and Seward to reckon upon-the possible capital to be made out of a great success by General M'Clellan, and the possible interposition of European Powers between England and the Northern States. Of two evils choose the most distant, is a favourite variation upon a well-known rule; and we are disposed to believe that Mr. Lincoln will prefer to hear the distant cannon of Britain rather than the yell of a mob under the windows of the White house. Therefore we do not look for a message of peace, though we hope for it, so far as hope is consistent with a calm examination of the case.</p>

<p>At the same time we are glad to believe that the French notification will have its weight with the American Government. Nothing can be more distinct than this document, and it points out so lucidly to Mr. Lincoln that Captain Wilks has committed an outrage, that the reasoning must be convincing, whatever the resolutions of the President may be. There can be no doubt of the valuable character of this State paper, inasmuch as it testifies to the European world that the first of the Continental Powers takes the side of England. It may also have the advantage of inducing Mr. Lincoln to reconsider his position and to devise some means of extricating himself from it without the fatal appeal. We speak, of course, of the document, not as if it had been composed at the period at which it was issued, but as the embodiment of a decision which was doubtless perfectly well known to our Foreign Minister when he sent the despatch to America. We cannot suppose that diplomatists acting in concert, as those of France and England are understood to do tarried for the issue of a formal despatch. They must have been in perfect accord at the time the demand of England left these shores; and the President was at once made aware that though England desires no physical aid in any contest into which she may be called to enter, she has, and is glad to have, the moral support of the Imperial Government. We can only say again that we wish to believe Mr. Lincoln strong enough to listen to reason and justice.</p>

<p rend="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The Tower has lately been the scene of great bustle, owing to the preparations for sending military stores to Canada. Night and day, on Sundays as well as other days, men have been engaged packing arms, clothing, and other necessaries to a great amount, which are placed on sailing-barges moored alongside the quays; the stores are taken thence down the river, and shipped on board the transports now off Deptford and Woolwich.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday week a great number of persons assembled at an early hour at the Wellington Barracks, St. James's Park, on the occasion of the departure of the 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards and of the 2nd battalion of the Fusilier Guards for Canada. The 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards, 800 strong, under the command of Colonel the Hon. Hugh Manvers Percy, C.B. (Victoria Cross), assembled, shortly after six o'clock, on the parade at the Wellington Barracks, preparatory to their departure for Southampton. After a due inspection, and after partaking of breakfast, at half-past seven o'clock the battalion left for the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. Owing to the death of the Prince Consort the regimental baud did not accompany the battalion to the station. On their arrival at the terminus the men were told off in fours, and with the greatest facility--the system having been initiated by the late General Torrens-the train started at eight o'clock with its gallant burden; so that the entire battalion, each man carrying his rifle and a cooked ration, left quarters and started by railway to their destinations within half an hour. The men were loudly cheered as they proceeded to the railway. The 2nd battalion of the Scots Fusilier, of the same strength, commanded by Colonel William John Ridley, left the Wellington Barracks at eight o'clock, and pursued the same route--along Birdcage-walk. Great George-street, and across Westminster-bridge. The same excellent arrangements were observed, and without slightest confusion or delay the battalion departed at half-past eight o'clock for its destination. As the detatchments reached the docks on arriving at Southampton, they were received by the Southampton Volunteer Rifle Corps, and escorted to their respective ships by the band. The troops were cheered as they left the docks an immense crowd of persons.</p>

<p>The steamer Adriatic, with the Grenadier Guards, and the Parana, with the Scots Fusilier Guards and the eighteenth company of the Royal Engineers, left the docks about two o'clock in the afternoon and anchored in the river. Both vessels sailed for their destination early on the following morning.The Parana had a berth in the docks close to the Nashville, the Confederate man-of-war. As she was leaving her berth, with the Guards on board, the band struck up the tune, "I'm off to Charleston so early in the morning," The officers of the Nashville were watching the departure of the Parana with apparently considerable interest.</p>

<p>Each soldier destined for Canada, on stepping on board of his transport, finds ready for him two pairs of woolen drawers, one jersey, two merino-under-vests, two pairs of worsted stockings, one comforter, one chamois leather waistcoat, one sealskin cap with ear-mufflers, one pair of sealskin mits, one pair of Canadian boots, and one sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail Company's steamer Magdalena, Captain Woolward, with, the 16th Foot (about 1000 strong) on board, took her departure from Southampton last Saturday afternoon. She is under orders to sail for I Halifax direct.</p>

<p>The Cunard Company's Royal mail steam-ship Asia, which sailed from Liverpool on Saturday for Halifax, carrying the mails for Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada, and other portions of North America, also took out about 470 military passengers, and nearly 200 tons of warm clothing, camping equipment, &c. The military arrived at Liverpool early on Saturday morning by special trains from Woolwich and Aldershott, and they were promptly conveyed in steam tenders to the Asia, lying at anchor in the Sloyne. The Asia sailed about 11:30 a.m., with an easterly wind and every prospect of making a rapid passage to Queenstown. Amongst the military passengers there were the staff for the army in Canada.</p>

<p>The Flying Fish sailed yesterday week for Lisbon, with sealed orders and despatches.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at the camp at Colehester for volunteering for the 15th. 17th, 36th, 47th, 62nd, 63rd, and 96th Regiments, which are destined for Canadian service, and which are short of their full complement of men.</p>

<p>The Government having decided on forming a reserve of troops at Bermuda, for operations in North America, orders were on Sunday received at Chatham for the fifth company of Royal Engineers to hold itself in immediate readiness to embark for Bermuda at an hour's notice.</p>

<p>Admirality instructions were received on Saturday directing the whole of the screw gun-boats attached to the first division of the steam reserve at Chatham to be removed from the several ports on the Medway for immediate service.</p>

<p>The following further arrangements for the embarkation of troops for Canada have been completed:- the Hibernian will sail from Liverpool for New Brunswick, taking the fourth company of the Royal Engineers -5 officers and 120 men; the G (Captian Hoste's) battery of the fourth brigade Royal Artillery, from Aldershott-7 officers and 255 men; the sixth battery of the tenth brigade Royal Artillery (Captain Robinson's), from Woolwich -6 officers and 117 men; a detachment of the  first battalion 15th foot- 4 officers and 147 men. The Canadian mail-steamer will take from Liverpool the seventh battery of the tenth brigade Royal Artillery (Captain Child's), from Woolwich- 6 officers and 117 men; and the eighth battery of the same brigade (Captain M'Rea's)- 6 officers and 117 men; the seventh battery for Halifax, the eighth for Newfoundland, the fifth company of the Royal Engineers for Bermuda- 4 officers and 100 men; and 6 men of the Army Hospital Corps for New Brunswick. The detachment of Royal Engineers under orders to embark in the Victoria will sail in the Calcutta.</p>

Hautefeuille, the learned author of "The History of Maritime International Law," and of "The Treatise on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Nations during Naval Warfare," has just given to the world a careful examination of the various questions involved in the Trent and Nashville cases. M. Hautefeulle divides the subject under three heads: admitting the right of search, he declares that the Captain of the American frigate "violated all the rules relating to the right of search." He asserts, "The reply to the question put is, therefore- First, that in no case can there exist contraband of war on a neutral vessel sailing between two neutral ports. Second, that even if there were contraband of war, the sole right of the cruiser would be to seize the vessel and to carry it into one of the ports of the own country to have it legally sentenced. Third, that persons cannot in any case be considered as contraband of war. Fourth, that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, not being in the military service of the Southern Confederation at the moment of thier arrest, could not be carried off from the neutral vessel in which they were sailing. From these answers it evidently results that Captain Wilks has committed a violation of all the principles regulating international relations." He also decides that President Lincoln has not the right to seize and make prisoners the inhabitants and officials of the Southern Confederation wherever he can find them, although he has the right to regard them as rebels.</p>

<p>M. Thouvenel, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, has addressed the following highly important despatch to the representative of France at Washington:-

<p rend="center">THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE FRENCH MINISTER AT WASHINGTON.</p>

<p rend="right">Paris, Dec. 3, 1861.</p>

<p>Monsieur,-The arrest of MM. Mason and Slidell on board the English packet Trent by an American cruiser has produced in France, if not the same emotion in England, at least great astonishment and an extreme sensation.</p>

<p>Public opinion at once inquired, with anxiety for the consequences, whether such an act could possibly be legitimate, and there cannot be the slightest doubt of the general impression. The act seems to the public so entirely at variance with the ordinary rules of international law that it throws the responsibility exclusively upon the commander of the San Jacinto.</p>

<p>We cannot know yet whether this supposition is well founded. And the Emperor's Government has therefore felt called upon to consider the question raised by the capture of the two passengers on board the Trent. The desire to contribute to prevent a conflict, which is perhaps imminent, between two Powers towards whom it is animated by equally friendly sentiments, and the duty of maintaining-with a view to put the rights of its own flag beyond the danger of attack-certain principles essential to the security of neutrals, have, after mature reflection, convinced the French Government that it cannot remain completely silent under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>If, to our great regret, the Washington Cabinet should be disposed to approve the conduct of the commander of the San Jacinto, they must consider MM. Slidell and Mason either as enemies or as rebels. In either case there would be an extremely regretable forgetfulness of principle, on which we have always found the United States agreed with us.</p>

<p>On what ground, in the first supposed case, can the American cruiser have arrested MM. Mason and Slidell? The United States have admitted, with us, in treaties concluded between the two countries, that the freedom of the flag extends to persona found on board, even though they be enemies, except in the case of military men actually in the service of the enemy. MM. Mason and Slidell were, therefore, by virtue of this principle, which we have never found any difficulty in getting inserted in our treaties of friendship and commerce, perfectly free under the neutral flag of England.</p>

<p>It will not, doubtless, be pretented that they could be considered as contraband of war. What constitutes contraband of war is not, it is true, precisely settled; the limits are not absolutely the same for all Powers; but, as far as regards persons, the stipulations found in treaties relative to military persons clearly define the character of the individuals who alone are liable to be captured by belligerents.</p>

<p>Now, it cannot be necessary to demonstrate that MM. Mason and Slidell can in no way be assimilated to persons in this category. There would, therefore, remain no ground to explain their capture but the pretext that they were bearers of official despatches from the enemy. But this is the place to call to mind a circumstance which overrides the whole case, and shows the conduct of the American cruiser to have been unjustifiable.</p>

<p>The Trent was not bound to it point belonging to either of the belligerents. It was carrying its cargo and passengers to a neutral country; and, moreover, it was at a neutral port that it had take them up. If it were admissible that under such circumstances, the neutral flag did not completely cover the persons and goods transported under it, the immunity of that flag would be a vain word; the commerce and navigation of third Powers would be liable to suffer at any moment for their innocent, or even indirect, relations with either of the belligerents. The latter would not only have a right to require from the neutral the most complete impartiality, and to interdict him from being mixed up in any way with acts of hostility, but they would inflict restrictions upon the liberty of commerce and navigation which modern international law refuses to acknowledge as legitimate. There would be a return, in a word, to those vexatious practices against which, in former times, no Power protested more energetically than the United States.</p>

<p>If the Washington Cabinet should regard the two persons arrested as rebels, whom it has always a right to seize, the question, though shifting its ground, could not be more resolved in a sense favourable to the commander of the San Jacinto. In such a case there would be a contempt of the principle in virtue of which a ship is held to be a portion of the territory whose flag it bears, and there would be a violation of the immunity which forbids a foreign Sovereign to exercise jurisdiction on that territory. It cannot doubtless be necessary to call to mind the energy with which the United States has, on every occasion, defended this immunity and the right of asylum which is a consequence of it.</p>

<p>Without wishing to enter upon a more thorough discussion of the question raised by the capture of MM. Mason and Slidell, I have said enough, I think, to show that the Cabinet of Washington cannot, without infringing those principles which all neutral Powers are alike interested in maintaining, nor without putting itself in contradiction with its own conduct up to the present time, give its approbation of the conduct of the San Jacinto. In this state of things the Cabinet of Washington cannot, in our opinion, hesitate as to the course to be taken.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons is already charged to present the demand for satisfaction which the English Cabinet is under the necessity of making, and which consists in the immediate release of the persons taken from the Trent, and explanations which shall relieve the act of the Captain of the San Jacinto of its offensive character to the British flag. The Federal Government would be inspired by a just and elevated sentiment in yielding to these demands. It is impossible to conceive any object or any interest that it could have to run the risk of provoking a rupture with Great Britain by assuming a different attitude.</p>

<p>For ourselves, who would see in such a rupture a complication in every way deplorable of the difficulties with which the Cabinet of Washington has already to struggle, and a proceeding calculated to occasion serious uneasiness to all the Powers not parties to the present conflict, we think we are giving a testimony of loyal friendship to the Cabinet of Washington in not concealing from it our opinion.</p>

<p>I request you. Sir, to take the first opportunity of speaking frankly with Mr. Seward, and, if he should desire it, to leave him a copy of this despatch.- Receive, &c.,  <p rend="right">T<hi rend="smallcaps">HOUVENEL.</hi></p>

<p>We state for the satisfaction of the relatives and friends of the troops leaving for Canada that the "Persia, and the other large steamers, carry each four boats fitted with Clifford's patent for instantly and safety lowering-them.</p>
