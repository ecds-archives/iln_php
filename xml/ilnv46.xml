<p>....The prospect westerly is not so auspicious. Would that it were
in our power to foretell the certain termination of the struggle in
America before the year 1865 has closed! We can only look and sigh
over the ruin that is there running its course, and try to hope that,
when the end comes, whether this year or next, or even at some point
of time beyond them, it will bring with it some compensation, which
future generations at least may regard as commensurate with immediate
sacrifices and sufferings. It is to the West we look with most anxiety
in respect of our own international relations. The discharge of the
St. Albans raiders by Judge Coursal, upon a mere technical flaw, might
easily open the way to war between us and our transatlantic kinsmen if
the two Governments were not guided by a spirit of self-restraint
towards each other. Happily, as on the part of Canada the judgment of
its legal officer has been spontaneously repudiated, so on the part of
the United States the rash order of its military officer has been
discountenanced; and where there is a frank recognition of each others
good faith, and an evident desire on both sides to clear up accidental
misunderstandings, we need not allow our anxiety to deepen into
apprehension. Hitherto we have maintained our neutrality without
compromise, and, with it, amicable relations with Mr. Lincoln's
Government. There is ground enough in the facts of which we have
present information for regarding a rupture between the two greatest
maritime Powers in the world as a calamity which is equally and
earnestly deprecated by both, and is therefore
improbable....</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Hibernia we have news from New York to the
afternoon of Dec. 24.</p>
<p>General Hood's defeated army succeeded in crossing the Duck river,
in spite of General Thomas's hot pursuit. On the 20th ult. Hood was
joined at Columbia by Forrest; and on the 22nd he had reached Pulaski,
seventy-five miles south of Nashville, still closely pressed by the
Federal cavalry. The Federal accounts estimate Hood's losses at 17,000
men, killed, wounded and taken prisoners; and represent Thomas's
losses not to have exceeded 5000 men.</p>
<p>General Sherman reports on the 13th ult., from Ossibau Sound, that
he had captured Fort M'Allister, opened communication with the fleet,
destroyed the railroads leading to Savannah, and invested the
city. His left rested on the Savannah River, three miles above the
city, and his right on the Ogeechee River, at King's Bridge. He had an
agreeable and unmolested march. His armywas in splendid order, and
amply supplied with provisions. During his march of 300 miles Sherman only
lost about 1000 men, and he arrived in front of Savannah with more
stores, provisions, and horses than he started with. About 700 negroes
joined him on the route. He destroyed 200 miles of railroad. He
estimates the garrison of Savannah, under Hardee, at 15,000, with
about 25,000 inhabitants. According to Confederate despatches "all was
well" at Savannah to the 19th ult.; and there was no further
intelligence respecting the progress of General Sherman's
operations. A letter from Admiral Dahlgren states that he is buoying
the Savannah River for an attack on the city in conjunction with other
forces.</p>
<p>The Southern journals alleged that General Breckenridge had
defeated the Federal General Burbridge, in the neighbourhood of
Saltville, in Western Virginia.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter's whole fleet was reported by a Confederate telegram
to have been in sight from Fort Fisher, near Wilmington, on the 21st
ult.; and the Confederate commander, General Bragg, added in his
despatch a confident declaration that he could hold Wilmington. It was
said that Porter's fleet had been crippled by a storm, and no
immediate attack on Wilmington was expected.</p>
<p>Advices received at New York state that the exchange of prisoners
at Charleston being ended, the bombardment of the city will be
immediately recommenced.</p>
<p>The Federal gun-boat Narcissus has been blown up by a torpedo at
Mobile.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has cancelled General Dix's order as to the pursuit of
raiders across the frontier into Canada. Some of the New York papers
complain of this. In Congress it had been moved to prepare an armed
force for the Lakes.</p>
<p>A draught of 300,000 men has been ordered. All absentees are also
ordered to rejoin their regiments immediately.</p>
<p>Secretary Fessenden is about to contract a new loan of 100,000,000
dollars.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has ordered that persons coming to the United States,
except immigrants, must have passports. This regulation applies
specially to persons coming from the British provinces.</p>
<p>Both branches of the Federal Congress had adjourned to the 5th
inst.</p>
<p>Gold was quoted at New York, on the afternoon of the 24th ult., at
220&#x00B7;.</p>
<p>In the Southern Congress there have been some noteworthy
movements. First, a resolution has been introduced to send
commissioners to treat with Federal commissioners upon the restoration
of peace. Mr. Foote, a member of the Confederate Senate, made a
speech, in which he declared the Confederacy to be on the verge of
ruin, and blamed Jefferson Davis for all the late military
disasters. Mr. Foote afterwards withdrew from the Senate. The <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Enquirer</hi> says that General Lee is in
favour of arming the negroes. The same paper declares that if
independence can only be attained by the sacrifice of slavery that
sacrifice must be made.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Parliament is summoned to meet on the 19th inst.</p>
<p>A proclamation has been issued by the Governor-General of Canada
calling out a large force of volunteer militia to prevent raids from
Canada into the United States, and to maintain order on the
frontier. Thirty companies of Canadian volunteers have been sent to
the frontier.</p>
<p>Three of the St. Albans raiders have been recaptured. The discharge
of the raiders by Judge Coursal is condemned by both the Government
and rebel newspaper organs in Canada, and the majority of the people
appear to be indignant at the critical condition in which the
relations between the Northern States and the provinces have been
placed by it. Mr. Lamothe, the chief of the Montreal police, had
resigned, it was supposed, to avoid dismissal. The bankers and
merchants of Montreal had addressed a memorial to the Governor-General
setting forth their desire that a fair and honest neutrality should be
maintained between the belligerent States of America....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SINKING OF THE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Confederate Steamer<lb/>Florida, In The
James<lb/>River.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> would have been disagreeable to the
national pride of the Americans if the Federal Government at
Washington, unable to answer the diplomatic remonstrances provoked by
the late violation of a neutral harbour of Brazil, had been obliged to
send back the Confederate steamer Florida, captured illegally by the
Wachusetts at Bahia on the 7th of October, and to replace their prize
where she was taken, beneath the sheltering jurisdiction of the
Brazilian sovereignty. From this mortification they have been saved,
as already reported, by the happy accident or expedient of sinking the
Florida ten fathoms under water in Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the
James River, where she was unaccountably run down by a Federal
transport-steamer, the Alliance, on the 19th of November, going to the
bottom a few hours afterwards.</p>
<p>The Illustration we now publish is from a sketch by Mr. Edward
L. Henry, of New York, who witnessed the event. The Florida is shown
as she appeared, having lost her mizenmast in the conflict with the
Wachusetts at Bahia. The ship seen to the right hand is an ironclad or
Monitor, named the Atlanta, which was stationed as a guardship at the
mouth of the river. In the distance is Newport News, with a military
camp on shore. The following account of the destruction of the Florida
is given by the correspondent of a New York paper:--</p>
<p>"On the 19th the Florida went to Norfolk to coal, and just before
starting was run into by the transport-steamer Alliance. She was was
in very bad condition when captured, and all the time since her
arrival here she has leaked so badly as to keep the steam-pump engaged
continually. The collision with the Alliance greatly increased the
volume of the water which constantly poured into her. About nine
o'clock on Sunday evening one of the pumps on board suddenly gave
out. Before more assistance arrived the water had risen considerably
above the fire-room floor, so that it was found necessary to put the
fires out. The pump-engine was thus stopped, and the water came
pouring in at a fearful rate. It was impossible at any time, after it
was found the ill-fated ship was sinking, to move her toward the
shore, as there was but 7 lb. pressure of steam--just sufficient to
work the pumps. Neither were there means at hand for towing her
ashore. In a few minutes after sending the two boats to the Florida,
Captain Woodward, of the Atlanta, came himself on<pb n="6"/> board to
see what could be done to keep her afloat. But it was apparent that
she must soon sink, and the men were ordered to save their effects and
prepare to leave her to her fate. The Florida kept rapidly filling so
that at seven o'clock the water was a foot above the berth-deck. At
the same time that Mr. Baker signalled the Atlanta he sent a
telepathic message to Admiral Porter at this place that the Florida
was sinking. The Admiral immediately ordered the tug Page to steam up
to the Florida and tow her into shoal water towards the shore. The tug
came alongside at 7.15, but the Florida was by this time so near
sinking that it was deemed dangerous to attach it, as in going down
she would take the tug along with her. A few minutes after, with eight
feet of water in her, she careened over, and disappeared stern
foremost. Mr. Baker and Captain Woodward remained alongside in the tug
until she went under. The Florida had all her guns and everything on
board just as when she was captured. There is a feeling of general
satisfaction among naval officers here at her fate. It is considered
much preferable to have her disposed of here, and then indemnity be
offered to the Brazilian Government, than suffer the humiliation of
taking her backs and seeing her saluted as she would enter the harbour
of Rio Janeiro in triumph, with the rebel flag flying. This would have
been a most bitter pill to the American officers who would have had to
accompany her."</p></div2>

<p>....But they are saying at the clubs, too, that Lord Lyons will not
return to Washington. His Lordship has but recently returned to this
country on leave of absence; but, if the sages of Pall-mall are to be
believed, he will not resume his arduous and thankless mission. He is
said to be suffering from an affection of the eyes; and, certainly,
the climate of Washington--scorching in summer and scarifyingly cold
in winter--is not favourable to the cure of affections of any
kind. But who is to replace an amiable and discreet diplomatist, who,
all things considered, has been the very best Minister we have ever
accredited to the United States? Washington might be an agreeable
change from Madrid to Sir John Crampton; but, alas! Sir John knows the
District of Columbia but too well. Did not our cousin turn him out of
it and out of the country to boot, ten years ago? Lord Napier; too,
has been promoted; but were it possible to take him from
St. Petersburg, his return to America would eminently please the
Northerners, among whom his frank and cordial manners have made him
exceedingly popular....</p></div2>

<p>....The opening paper in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, "President
Lincoln," by an American Abolitionist (Mr. Conway, we imagine), is
remarkable as a manifesto from that small but earnest band whose
triumphant contest in the name of principle against oppression,
supported by the entire strength of a mighty nation, forms as
remarkable and as encouraging a chapter in the history of the world as
the Reformation itself. We fear, however, that it is plain, on the
writer's own showing, that the Abolitionist leaders were incompetent
to carry out the movement they had so nobly inaugurated. An erroneous
fallacy pervades his essay, he fancies that he and his friends
represent the sense of the American people, and talks as though the
chief magistrate of the nation were bound to make himself the mere
instrument of a bare majority of the people of Massachusetts. Had
Mr. Lincoln done so, he and Massachusetts and the negro would long ago
have been swept away together in a tempest of popular wrath, and his
caution has been the salvation of the very men by whom he is so
fiercely denounced. He has been to Garrison and Phillips what Peel was
to Cobden, or Cavour to Mazzini--a practical, worldly wise man,
standing on a far lower moral level, but without whom lofty principles
and ardent imaginations would never have appeared in the guise of
realities....</p>
<p>This month's <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> witnesses the
conclusion of "Tony Butler," which has not wholly redeemed the promise
of its commencement, but is still entitled to the praise of an
interesting, animated tale. "The Man and the Monkey" is a most amusing
story, of a kind almost peculiar to <hi
rend="italic">Blackwood</hi>. "Cornelius O'Dowd" writes with sense and
point, except when treating of America, when his remarks betray great
flippancy and ignorance. The English officer's account of his visit to
the Confederate States is more satisfactory, though it is impossible
to repress a groan over the stupidity which could turn such splendid
opportunities to such poor account. However, we must take him as he
is, and be thankful. Charleston and the Chattanooga campaign are the
subjects of his present instalment. With characteristic infelicity he
managed to arrive at General Bragg' head-qnarters just too late for
the battle of Chicamauga, and to quit them just before that of
Missionary Ridge....</p></div2>

<p>The seal of the Confederate States of America, the composition of
which is by J. H. Foley, R. A., contains as a centre a representation
of that statue of Washington which was executed by the American
sculptor, Crawford, and erected at Richmond. The figure is mounted and
in uniform, as commanding in an engagement. It is surrounded by a
wreath beautifully composed of the most valuable vegetable products of
the Southern soil, as tobacco, rice, maize, cotton, wheat, and
sugar-cane. The rim bears the legend, "The Confederate States of
America, 22nd February, 1862. Deo Vindice." The seal is of silver, and
its diameter is from three to four inches.</p>

contained money, deeds, bills of exchange, draughts, cheques,
jewellery, and other valuables. Some of them were misdirected, others
not directed at all, other, unstamped, and others only partially
directed. Thousands of these dead letters were returned to the
writers, but the great majority had to be destroyed.</p></div2>

<p>By the Peruvian we have news from New York to the evening of
Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Savannah has fallen into the hands of the Federals. General Sherman
thus pithily notifies the welcome fact to President Lincoln:--</p>
<p rend="right">Savannah, Georgia, Dec. 22.</p>
<p>I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah, with
150 heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about 25,000 bales
of cotton.</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">W. J. Sherman</hi>,
Major-General.</p>
<p>General Sherman occupied the city on the morning of the 21st ult.,
and found the 20,000 inhabitants, he says, "quiet and well disposed."
The Confederate General Hardee had previously rejected a summons to
surrender; but during the 20th ult. he succeeded in transporting all
his infantry and field artillery across the river from the city to a
place called Union Causeway, and had thus escaped the assault which
the Federals intended to make, and withdrawn his troops before the
Federal works had advanced enough to impede his passage of the
river. Savannah advices of the 26th ult. report that an effort was
being made to intercept General Hardee's retreat before he could reach
the Broad River; but the Richmond journals stated that General Hardee
had arrived at Charleston.</p>
<p>As a set-off against the Federal success at Savannah, we have to
record the failure of the Federal attack on Wilmington. General Butler
had returned to Fort Monroe, and the transports with his troops on
board were also arriving there. Admiral Porter, with his frigates and
monitors, had proceeded to Beaufort, and was there awaiting further
orders. Admiral Porter, in his report of the operations, stated that
on the 24th ult., after a large powder-ship had been blown up under
the walls of Fort Fisher, without doing any damage, his fleet
bombarded the fort, and in an hour silenced the Confederate fire. On
the afternoon of the 25th 8000 troops, under the command of General
Weitzel, landed under cover of the fire from the fleet, captured two
batteries, and advanced within fifty yards of Fort Fisher, some of the
men even entering the outworks. General Weitzel, however, deemed a
successful attack impracticable, and reembarked on the same evening,
though about 1000 men remained ashore during the following day, in
consequence of the state of the weather. General Butler informed
Admiral Porter, on the night of the 25th ult., that an assault was
impracticable, as Fort Fisher was substantially uninjured as a
defensive work by the navy fire, and could only be reduced by a
regular siege; and he added that he should return to Fort Monroe as
soon as the transports for his troops were ready. Admiral Porter
vainly assured General Butler that the fire of his ships could keep
the Confederates inside the fort from showing their heads until a
storming column should be within twenty yards of the works, and that
the capture of the fort by assault, if attempted, would have been
easier than was supposed. An interesting feature in Admiral Porter's
report is his condemnation of the 100-pounder Parrott guns, which he
says were unfit for the service. Six of them burst, killing and
wounding forty-five men.</p>
<p>The notion of the powder-ship which, as stated above, was blown up
near Fort Fisher with such trivial result, was suggested by the
effect of the explosion at Erith; and the method of fitting out and
firing the vessel is thus described:--</p>
<q><p>The United States steam gun-boat Louisiana was taken to the
Norfolk Navy yard about a month ago, and such changes made in her as
would adapt her to receive the powder. She was also disguised as much
aspoesible, so as to give her the appearance of a
blockade-runner. After all the required changes had been made the
Louisiana was towed to Craney Island, where she was loaded. The hold
was left empty, as the powder at the explosion was desired to be as
much as possible above water. The powder was contained in a bulkhead
occupying a portion of the berth-deck and extending nearly to the
boilers. the first tier of powder was placed in the barrels with the
heads taken out, and the remainder was in bags. For the purpose of
exploding the powder, there were three clock-fuses placed in the
vessel, one in each gangway and one aft, near the boilers. From each
of these a patent Gomez fuse led completely round the vessel, and
terminated one in the hold and the others in the centre of the
berth-deck. Any one of the fuses ignited would fire all the others,
because each one crossed one of the others, and wherever they crossed
they were grafted. There were no absolute soundings of the shore in
the vicinity of Fort Fisher, and it was only a matter of conjecture
how near the Louisiana could go before she ran aground. When her
bottom first grated the sand her furnace-doors were to be thrown open,
the engines left running, and caps placed upon the fuses, the clocks
set, and everybody hurriedly transferred to the picket launch, the
tug, and the boats. The explosion was expected to take place in
thirty or forty minutes, and by that time the party, with their
steam-launch, would probably be five miles away. A provision was made,
however, in case something should occur--some accident befall the
launch. Under such circumstances they were to take the surf-boat and
row for life till<pb n="27"/> the time for the explosion, when they
were to jump overboard, go with ropes and buoys as far as possible
from the boat, submerge to the head, and, with cotton in their ears,
await the shock.</p></q>
<p>The Federals have been again repulsed in an attempt to land on
Roanoke Island; and an expedition by Granger against Mobile had,
according to Confederate accounts, been driven back.</p>
<p>There are contradictory reports as to Hood's movement. One account
says that he had crossed the Tennessee. Another states that the
Federal gun-boats had prevented him from crossing, and even adds that
the remnant of his army had been captured.</p>
<p>Although it was declared that the Federal Generals Stoneman and
Burbridge had been defeated in Western Virginia, it seems that they
have captured Saltville, the great manufactory of salt for the
South.</p>
<p>At Richmond there has been no new movement, but it was reported
that Lee was preparing to attack the Federals. The Southern press urge
Lee's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the
Confederacy.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has been made an LL.D. by the College of New
Jersey.</p>
<p>The President has remitted the sentence of the court-martial upon
Admiral Wilkes to a period of one year from its date. The sentence
suspended him three years from the service.</p>
<p>The Brazilian demand for explanation and reparation for the
seizure of the Florida has been replied to by a note from
Mr. Seward. Regret is expressed for the proceeding at Bahia. Captain
Collins is suspended and ordered to be tried by court-martial. The
United States Consul at Bahia is dismissed, and the men captured in
the Florida are to be set at liberty. Mr. Seward says the United
States have a complaint against Brazil for recognising the
Confederates as belligerents, but he adds that it is no part of the
duty of an officer to take upon himself the redressing of his
country's wrongs.</p>
<p>President Jefferson Davis has issued a declaration that
B. G. Burley--who has been apprehended in Canada, and who headed the
men who endeavoured to take the steamer Michigan on Lake Erie and then
release the Confederate prisoners on Johnson's island--is a
Confederate officer, and acted under the authority of the Confederate
Government.</p>
<p>The esteemed veteran English actor, Mr. James William Wallack--a
contemporary of Edmund Keen and Elliston--died at New York on
Christmas Day, aged sixty-nine, having been born in London in 1795. He
made his first appearance in America at the Park Theatre, New York, in
1818, and his great success and popularity with the play-going public
of that city induced him to divide his time thenceforth between
England and the United States. In 1836 he opened the National Theatre,
New York, and remained manager of it until it was destroyed by fire,
in 1839. He then returned to England, and played for some time at the
Princess's Theatre. In 1851 he once more crossed the Atlantic, with
the intention of residing permanently in America. The New York papers
record his decease with strong expressions of sympathy and regret.</p>
<p>The steam-ship North America foundered while on her voyage from New
Orleans to New York. She had on board 203 sick soldiers, twelve cabin
passengers, and a crew of forty-four men. Of these only sixty-two
persons were saved. Among the lost were Colonel Saunders and
Lieutenant-Colonel Horn.</p>

<p>The Governor of Canada issued a proclamation offering a reward of
200 dollars for the apprehension of each of the St. Albans

sent for examination to Montreal. Their trial began on the 27th ult.,
in the Superior Court, before Mr. Justice Smith. It was stated that
three of the raiders had made their way into the United States, and
had enlisted into the Federal service in New Hampshire, but had been

<p>"From Erith to Wilmington." The quiet little village, on the right
bank of the Thames, with its interesting old church and sundial
thereon, its yacht proclivities, and its water-side population, who
seem to get their living by leaning, in a long row, against the wooden
rails and, abusing one another in some dialect of Kent, was awfully
astonished on the morning when the powder blew up, by nobody's fault,
and in a second converted a scene of orderly industry into a hideous
ruin. But it must be almost as much astounded to learn that the story
of that explosion, having found its way across the Atlantic, set<pb
n="31"/> the Federal Admiral Porter upon a scheme for reducing a
strong Confederate fortress. Such, it appears, was the case; the ruin
wrought by that Erith catastrophe would, it was hoped, be paralleled
at Fort Fisher. Every clever precaution was taken to ensure success. A
tremendous quantity of powder was stowed on board a ship, and the most
ingenious system of clockwork was devised to fire the train at the
right moment. A grand expedition sailed against Wilmington, bearing
this floating mine with it, and in due course, and under favourable
circumstances, the powder-vessel was moored at the spot which had been
judged the best. Brave men fixed her at her moorings, set the terrible
clocks going, and escaped. The expedition watched with bated breath
for the eruption of the volcano. The clocks were faithful,</p>
<p rend="center">The nitre fired, and, while the dreadful
sound;<lb/>Responsive shook the yielding air around,</p>
<p>the assailants' hearts beat high; and, as the smoke cleared, the
Federals hoped to see a ruin where Fort Fisher had been. "The shock
was nothing like so severe as was expected," writes the frank sailor;
"it shook the vessel <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, broke one or two
glasses, but nothing more." Wilmington is luckier than Erith. However,
Admiral Porter, with a fine squadron, was not the man to be satisfied
with one failure. The experiment had been fruitless; but he had his
guns, and plenty of them, and he brought up his ironclads, and
commenced a fierce bombardment, which he describes, in the language of
the defender of Sebastopol, as a <hi rend="italic">feu
d'enfer</hi>. It silenced several of the fort batteries, blew up two
magazines, and set the place on fire. But there was delay in bringing
on the troops for the assault; and when it was effected the assailants
found that they could not succeed. When 3000 men had landed, the
Admiral was informed that they were re-embarking. Some brave feats
were performed, but General Butler did not see his way to storm. The
Admiral was clearly disgusted. He uses the ordinary civil language
towards a brother officer, and is certain that the latter had good
reasons for his conduct, but the gallant Porter thinks that it "would
have been worth while to make the attempt after coming so far." But
then he is only a smart sailor, while Butler, who has been an
attorney, may have known better when to issue his <hi
rend="italic">nolle prosequi</hi>. Finally, the attack was given up,
the expedition returned to head-quarters, and Wilmington is safe and
defiant.</p>
<p>This is an item which the Confederates are proud to set against the
series of Federal successes that marked the close of the year. They
have fairly beaten off one of the most formidable squadrons ever sent
against a fortress, and have been able to laugh at the failure of a
new and terrific-seeming engine of war. They gain nothing, it is true;
while Atlanta has been destroyed, and Savannah has been captured; but
they have saved a far more important port than either, and may
reasonably be exultant.</p>
<p>As regards the state of the war generally, at the opening of 1865,
we have less reason to be ashamed of stating that it is impossible for
people here to form a decided opinion, inasmuch as it is clear that
neither North nor South has an exact knowledge of the case. Sherman's
brilliant retreat, or march, has proved this. The Americans do not
know their own country. No one in the Federal district would speak
confidently of the probable success of Sherman; but those who did
attempt to demonstrate the truth were all wrong. They thought that he
was to pass through a poor and needy country; and so sincere was their
pity for the hardships he was to undergo that the most compassionate
articles were written upon the state of his army, and a painful
contrast was drawn between the meagre Christmas fare of his troops and
the ample comforts provided for the grand army of the Potomac. The
truth turned out to be that Sherman's men were marching through a rich
agricultural region, had the best food, never wanted a meal, and
arrived at Savannah in the highest health and strength. The Northern
writers now admit that folk generally did not know the resources of
Georgia. The truth is that the masses in America, with all their real
sharpness and all their flood of cheap newspapers, are very ignorant
about most things; and smart as is their talk, its chief cleverness is
that it covers a singular absence of exact knowledge. But, on the
other hand, the Confederates seem to have been equally uncertain as to
what Sherman could or could not do. His able feints at Macon and
Augusta no doubt bewildered them; but they must have known, one might
suppose, whether he could be encountered at all; and yet the most
opposite statements on the subject proceeded from the Richmond
papers. They know now that he marched all the way in triumph, his main
body scarcely hearing a cannon, his detachments burning and laying
waste, his whole force feeding on the fat of the land, and the negroes
crowding to his ranks, and having to be sent away sometimes by
force. But until the event had occurred neither South nor North could
give solid reasons for its anticipations. It is hardly to be expected
that English readers, even with the beautiful maps published under
Federal authority, should know more; although we have some idea that
our military men, with those charts before them, arrive at sounder
judgments than many folk in America, and that some of our journalists
give far more complete and truthful details than we find in the
Northern or the Southern press. But, so far as we can venture on a
decision, we must say that the enormous resources of the North are now
telling distressingly upon its antagonist, and that the admitted want
of men in the South, evidenced, too, by the renewed proposal to arm
the negroes, seems to point towards a crisis. The splendid valour
which the Confederates have displayed is unabated, and must not only
command respect in Europe, but in the North, and, with a generous
enemy, will certainly improve the terms on which the two parties will
soon, we trust, confer. Our own Foreign Secretary has said that,
though we are strictly neutral, the subjugation of the South would be
an injury to the cause of humanity, and we trust that both the word
and the idea will be alike discarded. The moment is not inopportune
for the discussion of an honourable peace, which must be obtained by
mutual concessions; and it could be wished that some Nestor could step
in between the transatlantic Ajax and Ulysses, and say,</p>
<p rend="center">"Forbear, my sons, your further might to
prove.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE TOWN AND PORT OF SAVANNAH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> town and port of Savannah, which
General Sherman has captured without a siege, by the retirement of the
Confederate General Hardee, whose forces were unable to defend the
place, is situated on the right bank of the River Savannah, eighteen
miles from the sea. It is the terminus of three railroads connecting
it with the neighbouring States of Alabama, Tennessee, and South
Carolina. The Savannah river, eed, marks the frontier between South
Carolina and the State of Georgia, to which the town or city of
Savannah belongs. The population was, previously to the war, about
25,000, and the place was a thriving mart for cotton, rice and lumber,
but especially for the Sea-Island cotton, the most valuable kind, that
is grown, produced nowhere except in the low lands along this
coast. The harbour is good, there being from 18 ft. to 21 ft. of water
at low-tide over the bar at the mouth of the river, while vessels
drawing 13 ft. can get up to the wharves of the town, and those
drawwing 15 ft. or 16 ft. may go as far as Five-fathom Hole, three
miles below the town. There is steam navigation up the river to
Augusta, a distance of 140 miles. The town itself stands upon a sandy
flat, about 40 ft. above the water. It is laid out with great
regularity, in spacious streets and squares, crossing each other at
right angles; the streets are lined with a double row of trees, and
the squares have inclosed gardens in the centre, like those of
London. There are fourteen or fifteen churches, one of which, the
Independent Presbyterian, is an elegant and costly structure of
granite; a Jewish synagogue, an academy, a courthouse, gaol, exchange,
barracks, arsenal, theatre, market-house, and various charitable
institutions. The accompanying Map or Plan will give some idea of the
capabilities of the place for military fortification.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> explosion of fifty-five tons of
gunpowder sufficed to frighten Erith out of its wits, wake Woolwich to
its foundations, and knock a considerable portion of the Thames
embankment into what is termed, in Hibernian parlance, "smithereens."
But 215 tons of powder exploded by the Federals under the lee of a
fort at Wilmington seem to have made no more impression on its walls
than the hundred plum buns full of calomel and prussic acid made on
Chunee, the mad elephant, at Exeter Change. Our cousins seem
unfortunate in their blow-ups. What a disastrous failure was the
springing of that mine before Petersburg last August! The
superstitious among the warriors of the great armada, which is said to
have returned to Fortress Monroe, may ascribe the failure of the
expedition to the presence of General Butler in a position of high
command. Jonah should have been cast overboard. But many of those who
are not superstitious might feel inclined to augur that no success
could attend an enterprise which was conducted on a Sunday and on
Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The veteran James Wallack is dead. Not many weeks have elapsed
since we saw him in his little bijou of a house in New York,
surrounded by the portraits of Macready, and Younge, and Kemble, with
his stalwart son Lester by his side, and a little grandson on his
knee, looking as handsome, and as dignified as of yore, and full of
his old humour, vivacity, and grace. He had been for many years a
cruel sufferer from the most atrocious form of rheumatic gout;
chalkstones exuded from him like drops of blood; his limbs were all
swathed in silken bandages; but at seventy years of age, and all but
bedridden, there were still in his eye and in his voice the vigour and
cheeriness of a young man. It was no wreck you saw before you. The
gallant and chivalrous Don C&#x00E6;sar, the dashing Massaroni, the
audacious Monseigneur, could still be recognised.</p>
<p>James W. Wallack was something more than a brilliant and versatile
actor. He was a high-minded and accomplished English gentleman. In his
own country the noblest in the land were glad to associate with him,
and more than one of his sons and nephews held commissions in the
British Army. He was the proprietor of the most charming theatre in
New York--a theatre wherein good English plays are performed by good
English actors, and had realised, we believe, a handsome fortune. His
son Lester, who is a great favourite as an actor in light comedy with
the New York public, and who is married to a sister of Mr. Millais,
the Academician, will, we presume, succeed to the management of
Wallack's Theatre. Some of the best traditions of the English stage in
its best days die with James W. Wallack....</p>
<p>We rarely allude to matters personal to ourselves; but there is an
acme of ill-treatment at which even the most patient camel will
groan. Among the multifarious publications of a Mr. Beeton we perceive
that there is a magazine specially devised for the delectation of
young ladies. We notice that Mr. Beeton, or Mr. Beeton's editor, has
chosen to appropriate two lengthy extracts from the series of papers
entitled "America in the Midst of War," written by the writer of these
"Echoes," and to publish them in his magazine as distinct articles,
appending to them the author's name. This is the more unseemly, as in
the whole course of our life we never wrote a line for Mr. Beeton. The
whole proceeding is exceedingly untradesmanlike. Every bookseller in
London knows that the experiences of the author of "America in the
Midst of War" are about to be published in book form; and had
Mr. Beeton's magazine been published in February instead of January,
an injunction in the Court of Chancery would very soon have taught him
the difference between <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi
rend="italic">tuum</hi>. Editorial scissors are excellent things, but
they are ill employed in taking the bread out of a labouring man's
mouth.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Saxonia and the City of Manchester we have
intelligence from New York to the 7th inst.</p>
<p>Everything was quiet at Savannah, and good order prevailed among
the citizens. General Sherman is reported to be in occupation of both
banks of the Savannah. It is believed that his next point of attack
will be Branchville, where the Charleston and Savannah Railroad meets
the Augusta road. The Confederates are preparing to defend this
important position. The military authorities of Charleston have shown
their sense of the near neighbourhood of Sherman by issuing an order
making it imperative on all slaves, not having permssion to remain, to
quit the city, and interdicting entrance to the city to all
non-combatants not having proper passes. At the same time the
engineers have set to work on the land defences of the place.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter appears to have withdrawn from Wilmington. General
Bragg reports the Confederate losses during the bombardment as three
killed and fifty-five wounded. Two guns in Fort Fisher burst, two were
dismounted by the Confederates, and two by the Federal fire. Southern
despatches contain a report that the Federals had five vessels sunk
and fifteen disabled, and lost all their horses in the gale off
Wilmington.</p>
<p>It appears that the Federals were to be supported in their attack
on Wilmington by a gun-boat expedition up the Roanoke River. According
to Southern advices, this expedition met with a disaster. Six
gun-boats were blown up by torpedoes and 1000 men were lost.</p>
<p>General Hood's whole army succeeded in crossing the Tennessee
River, and his head-quarters were at Corinth, whence he had reported
that his troops had sustained no material losses since his defeat near
Nashville. The Richmond papers publish a story of the capture by Hood
of a Federal brigade after his retreat from Nashville; but Hood; in
his despatch, says nothing of such capture.</p>
<p>The only news of importance from before Richmond is the failure of
Butler's Dutch Gap canal. An attempt was made to open it on the 1st
inst., when the earth fell in and closed the channel.</p>
<p>Guerrillas are becoming numerous and troublesome on the Potomac. It
is reported that Mosby is rapidly recovering from his wounds, and will
soon be again in the saddle. [We give on page 56 an Illustration, from
a sketch by our Special Artist, of a rendezvous of Mosby's men in a
pass of the Blue Ridge.] No important military operations in the
valley of the Shenandoah are reported, but the movements of the
Confederates in that region are said to be mysterious. Federal cavalry
is scouring the Loudon valley.</p>
<p>On the 24th ult. a force of about 2500 Confederates, under General
Wirt Adams, was threatening Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>
<p>A special despatch from Cairo states that General Dona's raid on
the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was successful. Twenty-five bridges were
burnt, and 4000 carbines, a large amount of ammunition, and 300 army
waggons captured. Many officers and men were taken prisoners, and
thirty-two railway cars destroyed.</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton had left Washington for Fort Monroe, Hilton Head,
and Savannah, in order to confer personally with Generals Grant,
Foster, and Sherman.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the Confederate Congress has secretly given
power to the Commander-in-Chief to detail 50,000 slaves for service in
the army as soldiers. Richmond papers continue to urge the Confederate
Congress to appoint General Lee Commander-in-Chief of all the
Confederate forces.</p>
<p>New-Year's Day falling on Sunday, the usual New-Year's holiday was
observed on Monday the 2nd. At Washington, the President's mansion was
freely thrown open, as is customary, and large crowds attended to pay
their respects. Among those present were all the foreign
Ambassadors.</p>
<p>The message of the Governor of New York to the Legislature
recommends a vigorous support of the war for the Union. the new
Governor calls upon the citizens to fill up their quota of the
draught.</p>
<p>In the Federal Senate, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, presented a
petition from officers of the army and navy asking for increased
compensation. Mr. Sumner presented a petition from coloured citizens
of New York asking for the abolition of slavery in the United
States. The Senate passed a vote of thanks to General Sherman and his
army. In the House of Representatives, the joint resolution to abolish
slavery by Constitutional amendment was debated without result.</p>
<p>Admiral Farragut has received a present of 50,000 dols. from the
merchants and people of New York.</p>
<p>The Hon. George Miffin Dallas, ex-Vice-President of the United
States, and more recently Minister to the Court of St. James's, died,
at his residence, in Philadelphia, on Saturday morning, Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Four persons were recently killed, and fifteen or twenty wounded,
by the breaking through the bridge at Hudson, Ohio, of a
passenger-train on the Pittsburg and Cleveland Railroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden is nominated Senator from Maine, and the Treasury
portfolio is virtually vacant.</p>
<p>The latest quotation of gold at New York was about 127 per cent
premium.</p>
<p>The Olustee made her escape from Wilmington on the night of Dec. 25
while the fleet was engaged in the attack on Fort Fisher. On the
following day she was chased by the United States gun-boat Lilian, but
finally turned upon her pursuer; and the Lilian, having only two guns
against five carried by the privateer, was forced to seek safety in
flight. The Olustee pursued for some distance, but the Lilian
escaped.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah has burnt several more American
merchant-ships.</p></div2>

<p>....We met the other day a gentleman who has made several millions
sterling by American blockade-running, and who spoke of one of his
cunning Flying Dutchmen craft as having "gone to resume her career of
usefulness." A new blockade-runner has just had her career cut
lamentably short in the Mersey, breaking her back close to the
north-west light-ship and going to pieces almost instanter. A
life-boat which put off to rescue her crew capsized by the violence of
the waves, and nearly all her gallant boatmen were drowned. We read
that they were unprovided with life-belts, which, according to the
rules of the service, they should have worn....</p>
<p>Mr. John Camden Hotten, whose curious volume on "The History of
Playing-cards" contains a very droll sketch of a pack supposed to have
been designed by the late Count d'Orsay, is about to give us an
English edition of the famous work of American humour called "Artemus
Ward his Book." Three or four years have passed since in this Journal
we used to notice occasionally a little comic paper at New York called
<hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>. To this paper (which was
short-lived) Charles H. Browne, whose pseudouym is "Artemus Ward," was
the chief contributor. The "Book" itself is an exquisite piece of
drollery. Artemus Ward is supposed to be a wild beast showman,
traveling through the States and commenting upon men and manners as he
goes along. His apocryphal narrative of a visit to the Prince of
Wales in Canada is inimitably funny.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">WINTER SKETCHES IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Correspondent</hi> in New York, to whose
pencil we owe the Illustrations of skating and sleighing in that city,
writes as follows:--</p>
<p>"A few days before Christmas we had a heavy snowstorm here, which
brought out the sleighs and made things look seasonable. Some of the
omnibus proprietors laid up their wheeled vehicles for the time,
substituting for them immense concerns on runners, drawn by six
horses, and capable of holding some forty persons each when closely
packed. I send herewith a sketch of one of these
omnibus-sleighs. Their occupation is a transient and uncertain one in
New York and, even as I write, the snow has quite disappeared, and mud
is the order of things once more.</p>
<p>"The brief spell of cold weather also brought out the skaters in
great force. For two or three nights many thousands of persons
enjoyed the sports of the ice in Central Park, the lakes and ponds of
which favourite place of resort were in excellent condition. The scene
at night, on such occasions, is very striking. Powerful burners are
placed so as to illuminate the whole surface, and the light from these
is reflected with great splendour by the clear ice. I send herewith a
sketch of one of these night scenes. The buildings on the further
shore of the lake contain accommodation for the skaters. There are
refreshment-rooms, a cloak-room, and another room where skates are
let out on hire. Here there is a long counter, behind which a great
array of skates of every description is displayed upon the
wall. Groups of persons are always collected round the great stove,
which is a feature of all public rooms in New York. Numbers of young
girls, attended by their beaus, are to be seen here, as skating has
become quite the fashion since the opening of Central Park, some four
or five years ago. The last day I visited the place I noticed in the
group around the stove a very respectable looking negro woman, dressed
in rather an expensive set of furs. She had with her two small boys of
colour, whom I afterwards saw wheeling about on their skates with
great glee. The policeman in the sketch is one of the park-keepers,
who are picked from the metropolitan police, and are remarkably fine,
soldierly-looking fellows, dressed in a very becoming, light-grey
uniform. The Americans are a progressive people. I observed that some
of the boys here who assist skaters in putting on their irons have
discarded the time-honoured gimlet, so long and favourably known in
connection with skates; using instead of it a bit and
brace."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> capture of Atlanta in October last,
followed by the march across Georgia to the seacoast, and recently, by
the capture of Savannah, has made General Sherman one of the most
notable officers in the Federal army. We give a Portrait of him and,
on the next page, a Map of his route from Atlanta to Savannah. William
T. Sherman was born in Ohio, in the year 1818. He entered, when young,
the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated
in the same class with General Thomas and then obtained his Ensign's
cornmission. He was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1841; and his conduct
during the Mexican war in California won him the rank of Captain. Upon
the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, he had a fresh opportunity of
active service, being appointed Colonel of the 13th Regiment of
infantry, which he commanded at the Battle of Bull Run. He was soon
afterwards raised to the rank of Brigadier-General and succeeded
General Anderson in command of the department of Ohio, from which,
however, he was removed because of a difference of opinion between
himself and the War Department as to the amount of forces required in
the Western States. At the Battle of Shiloh he took so prominent a
part that General Halleck reported the victory to be mainly due to
Sherman. He was therefore promoted to be Major-General and intrusted
with the command of the fifth division of Grant's army, with which he
was engaged in the siege of Vicksburg. During the last twelvemonth
General Sherman has performed those important operations in the States
of Tennessee and Georgia which have made his reputation second to none
in the military service of the Federal Government.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL SHERMAN'S MARCH THROUGH GEORGIA.</p>
<p>The map of General Sherman's route from Atlanta to Savannah, which
is engraved on this page, requires but little explanation. It will be
perceived that the central region of the State of Georgia, an upland
country, open and well-watered, fertile of wheat, cotton, and Indian
corn, is traversed by two railroads, from south-east to north-west,
converging at Atlanta, but running for some distance parallel to each
other, and forming the chief link of railway connection between
Virginia and the States of Alabama and Mississippi, now the south-west
limit of the Confederacy. One of these railroads is the Georgia
Central, running from Savannah to Macon, 190 miles, thence to Atlanta,
by the Macon and Western Railroad, 101 miles, making the total
distance from Savannah to Atlanta by railroad 291 miles. The other is
the Georgia Railroad running tram Augusta to Atlanta, at from forty to
sixty miles north of the Georgia Central Railroad, and making the
distance to Atlanta from Augusta 171 miles. The plan of General
Sherman's march contemplated the covering of these two lines of
railroad, their subsequent destruction, and a concentration of his
forces at or beyond Millegeville, with Kilpatrick's cavalry force well
disposed in front, and vigilantly covering each flank. The movement
and route of his infantry columns were so well masked that, from first
to last, the enemy were in total ignorance of the position of his main
body, and only discovered the track of his infantry columns after they
had left their vigilant foes many miles to the rear. This strategic
deception was aided by a feigned approach to Macon with the cavalry of
his right wing, which completely occupied the attention of the
Confederate General Cobb, whose militia, collected at that point,
were the only forces from which General Sherman could expect any
opposition. It was on the 12th of November that the right wing of the
Federal army, under General Howard, moved out from Atlanta and began
its march, proceeding southward on the way to Macon, and then turning
eastward, while the cavalry harassed and provoked the Confederates
within a few miles of that town. Meanwhile, on the 14th of November,
the Federal left wing, under General Slocum, set forth from Atlanta,
moving almost directly east, through Covington and Oxford to Madison,
thence turning southward to the rendezvous at Milledgeville. On the
same day General Sherman himself, with his own Staff, took the road to
Macon, so as to come up with General Howard. The crossing of the River
Ocmulgee was the first step which indicated that he would pass by
Macon without attacking that town; and if the Confederates had been
aware of this intention, they might have been prepared to interrupt
his passage here; but on that very day, Nov. 20, the Federal cavalry
were at Griswoldville, only eight miles from Macon, cutting up the
railroad and telegraph, burning a foundry, and doing other
mischief. Hence the Georgia militia, under Cobb and Phillips, were
induced to stand on the defensive at Macon; and it was not until the
22nd, when Sherman was already at Milledgeville, that they made an
assault upon his rear-guard, which was merely a skirmish without
result, though it cost them 600 killed and wounded. The right and left
wings of the Federal army, having destroyed the railroads and the
public buildings of every town through which they passed, even to the
Methodist college at Oxford, with its fine library and museum, came to
a junction at Milledgeville, and remained three days in that city,
where the State Legislature had been holding its session a few days
before. On the 24th General Sherman left Milledgeville, dividing his
army as before; and it marched, by the routes shown in our Map for
each wing respectively, to Millen, a distance of seventy-five miles,
in eight days, obtaining vast quantities of forage and much cattle,
especially in the neighbourhood of Sparta, in Hancock County. The
active movements of the cavalry, under Kilpatrick, contributed greatly
to deceive the enemy as to the position of the Federal army. It was
necessary to conceal the real direction of the march; for had Wheeler,
who commanded the Confederates in this district, known in time that
Augusta was certainly to be avoided, the entire force there could have
been sent down to Millen and, being thus thrown in Sherman's front,
would have resisted or delayed his march upon Savannah, and supplied
in the end a formidable addition to the garrison of that
place. Kilpatrick, therefore, pressed Wheeler more vigorously than
ever, and the latter fell back towards Augusta, which put him out of
Sherman's way most effectually, again leaving him in the rear of the
very army whose advance he was endeavouring to resist. The remainder
of Sherman's march was from Millen to Savannah, a distance of
seventy-nine miles. By the 10th of December he had arrived within five
miles of that city, but, with sound military judgment, he made
preparations at once, not for an assault upon Savannah, but for the
capture of Fort M'Allister, thereby opening the Ogeechee River,
communicating with the fleet, and making a water base on that river at
any point he chose, directly in the rear of Savannah; and also cutting
off all communication between Savannah and the southern part of the
State, vi&#x00E2; the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad, which has
heretofore been an important avenue of supplies to the rebels, from
the vast numbers of beef-cattle from Florida transported over
it. Accordingly, a division of troops from the 14th Corps, under
General Hazen, was sent down on the 13th, and the fort was gallantly
carried by assault, with its entire garrison and stores. This rendered
the situation of the army perfectly secure. The lines were stretched
across the peninsula in the rear of Savannah, the left resting firmly
on the Savannah River, about three miles above the city, and the
extreme right on the Ogeechee river, at Kingsbridge. Having cut off
all the roads leading to Savannah and obtained command of the Savannah
and Ogeechee rivers, he had made it impossible for General Hardee to
hold the city, which was consequently abandoned by the Confederate
General and taken possession of by Sherman in time to present it to
Mr. Lincoln "as a Christmas-box."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RENDEZVOUS OF MOSBY'S MEN IN THE PASS OF THE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Blue Ridge, Shenandoah Valley.</hi></p>
<p>Our Special Artist and Correspondent now at the head-quarters of
General Lee, in Virginia, has sent us a sketch representing a
night-scene which he lately witnessed in his excursion up the
Shenandoah Valley--the rendezvous of Colonel Mosby's corps of
irregular cavalry in a pass of the Blue Ridge Mountains. But we may
leave our Correspondent to describe this subject himself:--"During my
late visit to the valley of the Shenandoah with Kershaw's division, I
was fortunate enough to fall in with Mosby and a party of his famous
band. Though I found it extremely difficult to meet with this renowned
partisan chieftain, there are those amongst the Federals who find him
when they least expect and much less desire it. Your<pb n="67"/>
readers, no doubt, have frequently read paragraphs from the American
war news mentioning that Mosby had made another swoop from the
mountains of the Blue Ridge, capturing a Yankee supply-train and its
escort. To my mind he is the most astonishing guerrilla leader in the
Confederacy; and the tales one hears of him sound more like the
romance of war than the reality; but when it is considered how few men
he usually attacks with, his achievements are perfectly
marvellous. With comparatively a handful of troopers, he does not
hesitate to dash on a train of two or three hundred waggons, fighting
and dispersing a guard four or five times his number, and
appropriating to the use of the Confederacy the supplies and
transportation intended for Sheridan's army. At other tunes he will
fly at much higher game, piercing the centre of a large column on the
march, and before either the van or rear are aware of the cause of the
momentary tumult, he will be flying to the mountains with a goodly
number of prisoners. It is impossible to describe the terror that he
excites amongst the Federals; and whenever a party of them are moving
through the valley they are most eager in their inquiries as to
whether Mosby is anywhere in the neighbourhood. Of course they get but
little information from the inhabitants, whose idol he is. Originally,
Mosby's band consisted of but one company, but it has lately been
raised to a thousand, and he himself made a colonel in the Confederate
army, though none of his men are regularly enlisted soldiers. They are
mostly sons of farmers and gentlemen, who prefer the ubiquitous life
and its stirring adventures offered by their chieftain to the
comparative monotony of the ranks in a Virginia regiment. They receive
no pay from the War Office, but, instead of it, they are allowed to
dispose of their captures for their own benefit, the Government being
the purchaser. As soon as an expedition has been resolved upon, Mosby
sends a summons to his men, who are dispersed in every direction, to
meet him at some gap in the mountains, generally at night, and few
fail to answer the call. If they should do so three times
consecutively they are immediately handed over to the authorities and
conscribed into the regular army. My sketch shows a rendezvous of the
band in a pass of the Blue Ridge; Mosby is seated on his horse in the
shadow of a rock, and troopers are galloping up on all sides; others
are dismounted, waiting the order to move. Beneath, the Shenandoah
river winds its course through the fertile valley of
Virginia."</p></div2>

<p>....<hi rend="italic">The War in America</hi>--1863-64. By Edward
Pollard. (1 vol. Saunders, Otley, and Co.) Mr. Pollard, who was lately
editor of the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi>, has already
given his account of the first two years' war in America; and he has
now brought his narrative down to the critical moment when the
cautious Confederate General Johnston was superseded by the dashing
Hood. It will be seen, therefore, that he has left off at a point when
the campaign in Georgia became particularly interesting; but the
readers of the daily newspapers will easily supply for themselves what
Mr. Pollard's history lacks. Indeed, it is a question whether an
attentive perusal of the newspapers will not have given the peruser
quite as vivid and accurate an idea of the whole war up to the present
time as can be derived from Mr. Pollard's book. Mr. Pollard, as is
natural, is a warm partisan of the Southern cause and an ardent hater
of the Yankee. According to him, Yankee Generals are incarnate fiends,
and Yankee privates are not much better. Peace between North and
South, except the "wayward sisters" be allowed to have their desire,
is utterly impossible. And yet he is by no means a worshipper of
Mr. Jefferson Davis; he accuses Mr. Davis of conceit and obstinacy,
and attributes no less a disaster than the loss of Vicksburg to
Mr. Davis's headstrong partiality for General Pemberton. The story of
the war is told in a sufficiently sickening manner by the impassible
telegraph: whoever has the stomach to swallow it, warmed by passion
and spiced with virulence, will do well to try a dose of Mr. Pollard's
preparation....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> relations of our chief Transatlantic
colony to the United States are not quite so cordial just now as could
be wished. None of the ties which connect them together in
international friendship ae actually severed, but a process has set in
which, if allowed to go on much further, may very possibly end in
rupture. Symptoms of incipient inflammation are already visible, and
even where irritability of feeling is but slight, it greatly increases
reasonable apprehension of the effects which may result from
accidental causes. We believe that neither in the States nor in the
colony is war desired by either the people or their Governments. And
yet it cannot be concealed that, in opposition to the interests, the
policy, and the will of both, an extraneous agent of discord has
thrust itself between them, and has succeeded in giving to their
position toward each other an aspect of antagonism. The best of
neighbours are sometimes set together by the ears by the intemperance
of some third party, and nations are occasionally brought into
collision by the compulsory discharge of responsibilities which might
have remained dormant but for the follies and crimes of people whom
they both condemn.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the border States of the American Union
have suffered more from the raids of so-called Confederates from the
frontiers of Canada than any people would be likely to tolerate with
equanimity. The actual amount of damage done may have been small; but
the sense of insecurity, the apprehension, the suspense excited over a
wide extent of country, have been considerable, and have naturally
given rise to excessive soreness of feeling. The raiders were
political refugees from the Southern States, to whom Canada, nobly
imitating therein the policy of the mother country, had accorded
prompt and generous hospitality. Unfortunately, the guests who
received shelter in the colony do not seem to have recognised any
obligation of consulting the convenience of their host, and, under the
protection they have received, assert their right to levy war against
and harry a neighbour with whom she is at peace. Without inquiring
into the prevailing sympathies of Canada in reference to the pending
struggle in the United States, it is sufficient that her Govern<pb
n="78"/>ment honestly reprobated any such abuse of her hospitality,
and showed its sincerity by disclosing to the Government at Washington
every conspiracy against it of which it had an inkling of
information. This neighbourly loyalty was so far reciprocated that,
when the St. Albans raiders were captured by the Vermont militia on
the Canadian side of the border, the prisoners with their plunder were
unhesitatingly given up to the colonial authorities and their
extradition demanded in conformity with law. The unhappy decision of
Judge Coursal, by which the raiders were set at liberty and their
booty restored to them, gave a momentary appearance of collusion
between them and the government at Quebec. Momentary, we say, for the
judgment was repudiated at head-quarters the next morning, and fresh
warrants were issued against the accused, but quite sufficient to fire
susceptibilities and passions not easy to be quenched. In the full
blaze of this indignation General Dix issued his intemperate order to
the military under his command to pursue all future raiders across the
border if necessary, and to bring them thence to be dealt with as
martial law in the United States might determine--an order for setting
at naught the Queen's sovereignty which Mr. Lincoln had the good sense
immediately to command the General to withdraw. Nevertheless, although
the Canadian Government acted with the greatest decision and energy in
endeavouring to counteract the mischief of Coursal's judgment, have
since recaptured most of the liberated raiders, and have dispatched to
the frontier a force of volunteers competent to prevent future
depredation, the brief hurricane of anger in the States compelled the
unwilling statesmen at Washington, and afforded an opportunity to the
willing, to take some steps which have placed the relations of the two
Governments in a rather unsatisfactory position.</p>
<p>Canada is menaced with two serious evils by the President, and is
already galled by the infliction of another by Mr. Seward. Mr. Lincoln
is proceeding to give the six months' notice to the British Government
necessary to free the United States Government from the obligations of
the treaty which restrains both Powers from having more then one armed
vessel on the great inland waters that divide their respective
dominions. The wisdom of that treaty, and its effectiveness in
preventing needless expense and hostile collisions, have been fully
recognised by both parties, and incontestably proved by a long
experience. In what precise way the abrogation of it will operate for
the security of the American border States from the incursions of
lawless men, it is difficult to see. The only certain effect of it
will be to compel Canada to maintain on the lake flotillas of equal
strength, to involve both Governments in unnecessary expenditure, and
to multiply the chances of future misunderstandings. The step has
probably been taken partly with a view to threaten Canada, but chiefly
for the purpose of amusing irritated public feeling in the North, and,
possibly, the notice will not be followed up by action.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has also intimated to our Government that the
Reciprocity Treaty, which will soon expire, will not be renewed in its
present form. It is a strictly commercial agreement between the two
Governments, under which great advantages have accrued to the people
on both sides. It may be that the balance of advantage has been in
favour of Canada; but, in truth, each country gets by means of it what
it most wants from its neighbour at a much cheaper rate. Here again
the political wisdom of the menace is lost in obscurity. Canada cannot
be punished by the termination of the treaty without including in her
punishment large and influential classes in the States themselves; and
the Chamber of Commerce at Detroit, to which the question was referred
for examination and report, have lucidly pointed out the mischief
which the execution of the threat will inflict upon the trade and
prosperity of the American Union, as well as its utter inutility as a
political expedient. Where the interests are mutual, and ample time
remains for deliberation, it may be hoped that sober judgment will set
aside the intentions of temporary exasperation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Seward has struck his blow at once. He has established a
passport system along the frontier, which, as the <hi
rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi> observes, can be of no earthly use
for the prevention of raids; but which, by the heavy price demanded
for passes, not only prevents any American from passing into or out of
Canada who can possibly do his business in any other way, and thus
deprives her, to a large extent, of a large and lucrative traffic, but
which also taxes the trade which may be carried on in spite of the
regulation. In point of fact, the telegram sent over by the last mail
represented the overland intercourse between the two countries as very
nearly suspended, which statement, although pointing to a possible
truth, must be regarded as giving us a description of facts as they
are seen though the mist exhaled by anger. The commercial dealings
between Canada and the United States are too numerous, too various,
and too important, to allow of their being carried on satisfactorily
without the passing and repassing of commercial agents across the
border. A six-dollar fine each way is a heavy tax, no doubt; but
scarcely heavy enough, one would imagine, to stop all traffic
requiring personal superintendence. And, indeed, thus much may be
inferred from the <hi rend="italic">Globe's</hi> proposal to levy on
the Canadian aide, sum for sum, whatever is levied on the American
side. "No American," says that journal, "who can help it will, while
Mr. Seward's passport system exists, cross the boundary line either
way. But those whose business compels them to do so would not be
prevented therefrom by an additional six dollars. We have as good an
excuse for carrying out our plan as the Government of the United
States have for carrying out theirs. They wish to prevent raids; so do
we. They have instituted a passport system for the purpose; let us
follow their example; let us make all the passports they have issued
worthless, so far as we are concerned, until they have been
vis&#x00E9;ed by our agent to an equal charge to that of the United
States. We may just as well make money out of the business as
they."</p>
<p>We trust the Government at Quebec will think long and seriously
before they act on this advice. That the course proposed will not mend
matters is obvious. That it will contribute but little to the Canadian
Exchequer is confessed. It would be simple retaliation, which, in the
present state of affairs, is precisely what is least to be
desired. Mr. Seward, whose bias and habits as a politician are known
more than they are honoured, has committed the United States
Government to an act of petty vindictiveness. It would be bad policy
it the Canadian Government should suffer themselves to be provoked
into following his undignified example, and thus throw the sympathy of
American traders into his scale. The existing irritation is temporary
in its character and mainly factitious. Wise statesmanship will give
it time to die away. Just now, the most pressing duty of the Canadians
is to mature and set in motion the Constitutional machinery which will
make British North America a strong empire, and to put up, as best
they may, with the small annoyances inflicted upon them by regulations
which injure their neighbours as much as themselves. Great and
permanent interests are at stake, and it is by their regard to these
rather than by the impulse of angry excitements, even if justifiable,
that their present policy should be shaped. They have borne themselves
nobly hitherto; let them not descend to a miserable contest with
Mr. Seward, nor fight him with vulgar weapons. As a matter of fact,
although through no fault of theirs, the fire was kindled by sparks
from their own side, and they will, doubtless, recognise the propriety
of forbearing to add fuel to the flame.</p></div2>

<p>The news from New York, to the 11th inst., is unusually barren of
military events. We hear much of preparations, and some movements are
reported which may prove preliminary to important undertakings, but
there are no operations of consequence.</p>
<p>There were rumours of Federal expeditions on a large scale, to be
led by Generals Sherman and Thomas. The former is to operate in
Georgia and North Carolina; and another attempt to take Wilmington is
to be made, a land force being sent from Newbern to attack the city in
the rear while a combined naval and military force operates against
Fort Fisher. General Thomas was concentrating his troops on the
Tennessee, with the view of making a campaign through Mississippi and
Alabama. The Confederates were preparing to meet these aggressions;
and it was rumoured that General Lee had been placed in command of all
the Confederate forces, and that, putting Beauregard in command of the
defences of Richmond, he himself intended to go and confront
Sherman. General Hood was re-forming his army and getting in readiness
to meet Thomas or operate against Sherman.</p>
<p>The armies before Richmond and Petersburg have for some time ceased
to be the most active of the Federal forces; and the only change
reported from that quarter is the supercession of General Butler by
General Ord, an able and well-tried soldier. Butler has been ordered
to report himself at Lowell, Massachusetts, his native place. Various
charges, military and civil, have been brought against him, and his
disgrace appears to be complete. His removal gives rise to very little
difference of opinion. A few, however, remark that he is now out of
place, while a great number insist that he had been out of place for
the past four years. The committee on the failure of the great mine at
Petersburg has made its report. General Burnside is exonerated from
all responsibility for the failure, and Generals Grant and Meade are
censured.</p>
<p>General Sheridan has established his troops in comfortable winter
quarters in the Shenandoah Valley. Great scarcity of food is said to
exist in this once rich but often devastated district.</p>
<p>Up to the close of last year 3,604,743 men had been draughted into
the Federal armies by the conscription orders of the Washington
Government. In 1861 there were 664,743 men draughted; in 1862 there
were 740,000; in 1863 there were 700,000; and in 1864 there were
1,500,000, making the grand total as above. This embraces only the
several calls and draughts, and is quite independent of voluntary
enlistments and the 500,000 men called for a few days ago.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Blair, father and son, have again set out for the
capital of the Confederacy, on a supposed peace mission, not
official.</p>
<p>A bill passed by the Federal Senate emancipates the wives and
children of coloured soldiers.</p>
<p>The Washington Government has sent forces to the Canadian frontier
to prevent persons coming into the United States without a
passport.</p>
<p>The Governor of the State of New York, in his inaugural message,
delivered on the 2nd inst., stated that 182,766 alien immigrants
arrived at the port of New York in the course of the year 1864--an
increase of more than 25,000 over the number in 1863, and as large a
number as in any year since 1854.</p>
<p>The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher presided this year, as usual, at the
annual letting of pews and aisle-seats in Plymouth Church,
Brooklyn. The proceedings took place in the church on the 34d
inst. The premiums bid were much larger than ever before. The highest
bid last year was 200 dols.; this year, 400 dols., which, added to the
pew-rent, makes the largest total payment for the year for one pew 520
dols. Twelve pews were sold at prices (including premium and pew-rent)
exceeding 400 dols. each, and sixteen more brought above 300 dols. The
congregation have raised the salary of their pastor from 7500 dols. to
12,500 dols. per year.</p>
<p>Governor Cannon, in his annual message to the Legislature of
Delaware, again takes strong ground in favour of emancipation in that
State, as he did in his inaugural address.</p>
<p>The Missouri Convention have resolved to reorganise the State
Constitution.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Boston Traveller</hi> publishes a list of 103
persons in that city whose annual incomes are above 25,000 dols., as
returned under the special income tax. Ten taxpayers in the fourth
district are assessed upon incomes of more than 100,000 dols. each,
after the deductions allowed by law were made.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, in his annual message, just
issued, calls attention to the excess of women in Massachusetts, and
to the surplus of men in Oregon, California, and other remote western
communities. In Oregon, having 52,160 inhabitants, according to the
Census of 1860, there were 19,961 males over fifteen years old, and
only 9878 females above that age. Its population is estimated at over
100,000, this disproportion yet remaining. In Massachusetts there were
257,833 males between the ages of fifteen and forty, and 287,000
females; or, a surplus of 29,166. The excess (the Governor says) of
women of all ages above fifteen years was 38,846. The absorption of
men by the military and naval service during the intervening four
years has aggravated this disproportion. He recommends the adoption of
some practical way by which young women may be enabled to emigrate to
useful fields of employment in the Western States.</p>
<p>A party of about 1600 Indians made an attack on Julesburg, Colorado
territory, on the 7th inst., robbed the overland mail and express,
dispersed a mule-train, destroyed the stage-station and a large amount
of the telegraph materiel, and killed nineteen soldiers and
citizens. A severe fight took place between the Indians and the
troops, the latter numbering altogether less than a hundred; but the
former were finally driven off, with the loss of their chief and
twenty-four others killed.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Montreal Court (as stated in a portion of our Impression last
week) has reconsidered its decision in the case of the St. Albans
raiders, and has decided that it has jurisdiction in the matter.</p>
<p>It is said that the new Federal passport system has nearly put an
end to the travelling of Americans in Canada, the passenger-trains on
both the Grand Trunk and Great Western Railroads now running nearly
empty west of Toronto.</p></div2>

<p>....Talking of companies (limited), we hear that a boay of
gentlemen, long residents in, or acquainted with, or interested in the
United States, are about to try in London an experiment which in New
York has, of late years, met with triumphant success. It isn't
tramway; it isn't volunteer fire companies; it isn't paper
currency. But what will our readers think of a "London 'Delmonico'
Company" (limited)? Delmonico's at New York is simply the best and
most splendid restaurant in the world. There is nothing in Paris to
beat it; there is nothing in London, with all its plethora of hotels
and dining-rooms, to equal it. Delmonico's is a combination of the
Trois Fr&#x00E8;res, the Maison Dor&#x00E9;e, Philippe's (Rue
Montorgueil), Bignon's, the Trafalgar at Greenwich, the Star and
Garter at Richmond, the Hotel de Russie at Frankfort, Florian's at
Venice, the Ship and Turtle, Leadenhall-street, Darba's at
St. Petersburg, and the dining-rooms of the best Pall-mall clubs. You
may dine at Delmonico's for a dollar, and for a party of eight your
bill may come to a thousand dollars--precisely as you please. You may
be served off gold, and have pearls dissolved in your sauterne if you
choose. The projected "London 'Delmonico' Company" will of course
appeal chiefly to the wealthiest and moat luxurious classes. The
locale will be a splendid mansion at the West End, the furniture will
be gorgeous, the waiters irreproachable, the cookery simply
perfection, the wines:--<hi rend="italic">ne m'en parlez pas</hi>. The
servants will be superb in plush and silk stockings; and for a <hi
rend="italic">diner d'&#x00E9;l&#x00EE;te</hi> the major-domo will
bring in the first dish with a silver chain round his neck and a sword
by his side, according to the grand old traditions of the days of Ude,
and Car&#x00EA;me, and D'Ouix. The experiment is a bold one; but what
may not be tried in London the stupendous?</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Nova Scotian we have news from New York to
the 21st ult.</p>
<p>Whilst General Butler was giving evidence at Washington of the
impossibility of taking Fort Fisher, that powerful stronghold fell
under a combined attack of Admiral Porter's fleet and an assault made
by General Terry in person. The Wilmington expedition arrived off Fort
Fisher a second time on the morning of the 13th ult. At an early hour
Admiral Porter dispatched a portion of his fleet to a point about
three miles and a half from Fort Fisher, with orders to shell the neck
of land which at this place separates the shore from the river, and
which was thickly wooded, whilst in the meanwhile the iron-clad
frigates and the monitors were ranged within a distance from the fort
varying from half to three-quarters of a mile. At nine o'clock in the
morning the landing of the troops was begun, and as 200 boats had been
told off from the fleet to convey the soldiers from the transports to
the shore, 4000 troops were safely landed in the course of an
hour. The vessels which had been engaged in shelling the woods
previous to the landing of the troops then moved in the direction of
Fort Fisher, continuing to shell the adjoining line of coast; and at
four o'clock in the afternoon, the disembarkation having been
completed, the Federal troops, to the num<pb n="103"/>ber of 6000,
advanced two miles up the promontory, thus reducing their distance
from the fort to a mile and a half, where they remained until the
15th, on the evening of which day the fort was taken by
assault. Whilst one portion of the fleet was engaged, on the morning
of the 13th, in covering the landing of the troops, the ironclads and
monitors opened a bombardment on Fort Fisher. This bombardment is
described as having been incessant during the greater part of that
day, and the guns of the fort were either silenced or the commander of
the garrison was convinced of the inutility of firing upon the Federal
ironclads. In the course of the same day Admiral Porter directed the
wooden frigates, which had in the morning been engaged in shelling
that part of the coast where the troops landed to take part in the
bombardment, which they did, without, however, provoking a return fire
from Fort Fisher. During the night shells were occasionally discharged
against the fort, and on the afternoon of the following doy the
bombardment was renewed in all its previous intensity. On the morning
of the 15th it was continued, and at four o'clock on the same
afternoon the troops made the assault. Whilst three brigades advanced
to the attack, a division of the Federal army, remaining on the ground
it had occupied for the preceding two days, held the promontory
against the Confederate forces, which, under Hoke, advanced from the
direction of Wilmington, and which would otherwise have taken the
assaulting column in the rear. The defence of the fort was obstinate,
but fruitless. A battalion of sailors and marines, which had been
landed during the day in order to co-operate with the land forces, was
repulsed; but ultimately the garrison, being outnumbered, was obliged
to evacuate the fort. Hemmed in on one side by the river and on the
other by the sea, the Confederates (to the number of 1200) could not
retire beyond the extremity of the promontory, and as a matter of
course, were there compelled to surrender. The Federal loss was
considerable, but it is more then counterbalanced by what is
unquestionably a substantial success. On the first day the monitors
alone were at first engaged, and from eight in the morning till four
in the afternoon poured in 2000 ponderous shells--at the rate of four
a minute; then both divisions of the fleet, iron and wood, were
engaged with 312 guns, and in one hour and a half fired 21,600
shots. Fort Smith, on the opposite side of New Inlet, was subsequently
abandoned and blown up by the Confederates. Wilmington was reported to
be held by 5000 Confederates, under General Hoke; and it was not known
that further operations would be immediately undertaken by the
Federals. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi> thinks that the
capture of Wilmington is not a necessary, but a probable, consequence
of the fall of Fort Fisher, and urges the burning of all cotton in
Wilmington.</p>
<p>In consequence of this success, General Grant has ordered a salute
of a hundred shotted guns to be fired against Petersburg and Richmond
by each of the armies co-operating against those cities.</p>
<p>General Sherman had sent part of his army to reinforce General
Foster, who had occupied Pocotaligo, on the Savannah and Charleston
Railway, the Confederates having abandoned their works there. It was
reported that General Sherman was menacing Branchville. It was stated
that a considerable body of Federals was intrenched at Franklin Mills,
on the Dog River, and that serious operations were about to be
undertaken against Mobile.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair has returned from Richmond, and a general impression
prevails that negotiations in some form are afoot on the question of
peace. In the Confederate Congress, however, a strong determination to
prosecute the war is expressed. The <hi rend="italic">Charleston
Mercury</hi> of the 12th ult. says:--"The crisis of the Confederacy
has arrived in fatal earnest. The result of the next six months will
bring the Confederacy to the ground or will reinstate its
power. Without reform we are doomed. There must be no more Jeff Davis
foolery, but brains and nerve; reform, shooting, cashiering, order,
subordination; soldiers--not runaways, ragamuffins, ruffians."
Mr. Foote, the Confederate orator who denounced the policy of
Jefferson Davis within the walls of the Southern Congress, has been
captured in an attempt to reach the Federal lines. General Lee, it was
alleged, was urging the Confederate Government to order a conscription
of negroes, and to emancipate the conscripts and their families.</p>
<p>The monitor Patapsco has been destroyed off Charleston, while on
picket duty, by several torpedoes. Fifty of the crew were drowned.</p>
<p>The resolution of Congress to terminate the Reciprocity Treaty has
been approved by President Lincoln; and the Senate has ratified the
notice to be given to England for the termination of the Lake Naval
Force Treaty. Senator Sumner has introduced into the Senate a
resolution proposing that notice should be given for the termination
of the Extradition Treaty with England.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislature had almost unanimously rejected a
resolution "to make peace through State action."</p>
<p>Slavery has been abolished in Missouri and Tennessee by State
conventions.</p>
<p>The Hon. Edward Everett, formerly Ambassador for the United States
at our Court, died recently, of apoplexy, in Boston. Mr. Lincoln
ordered the customary marks of respect to be paid to his memory. The
Government buildings in Washington were to be draped with mourning for
thirty days.</p>
<p>Captain Bell and three other Confederates, charged with the attempt
to burn the New York hotels in November last, have been arrested near
the Canadian frontier and consigned to Fort Lafayette. General Warren
has been ordered to convene a court-martial for their trial.</p>
<p>A considerable fluctuation in gold had taken place, prices ranging
between 199 and 206, the latter being the latest quotation.</p>
<p>A curling-match between Canada and the United States was played at
Buffalo on the 5th ult. At the close of the day the score was found to
be:--Americans, 478; Canadians, 658; showing a majority of 180 for
Canada. The curlers afterwards dined together in the American Hall. By
special order of Mr. Seward, passports were not required from the
Canadians at the frontier on this occasion.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Parliament met at Quebec on the 10th ult. The
Governor's message announced that a bill to give the Executive further
powers to deal with political refugees who commit outrages on the
border and a plan for the constitution of the Confederation, would be
laid before the Parliament.</p>
<p>One of the Canadian raiders has been declared guilty of robbery,
and been adjudged to be delivered over to the Federal authorities. A
writ of habeas corpus had been demanded on his behalf.</p></div2>

<p>....The Hon. Edward Everett is dead. He was one of the best of
American classical scholars--the Hon. Charles Francis Adams is said to
be the strongest in Greek. Mr. Everett's character, during a long and
active life, was very pure and blameless, and he was in all respects
the model of a courteous and polished American gentleman. He was at
one period Minister Plenipotentiary from the great Republic to the
Court of St. James's, and was nominated (on the "Bell and Everett
ticket") for Vice-President of the United States. He was great at
orations. His grand discourse on Washington was delivered no less than
129 times in different parts of the Union in aid of the funds for
purchasing Mount Vernon; and a couple of years since he pronounced a
harangue over the graves of the Federal soldiers killed at Gettysburg,
which an enthusiastic old lady-listener declared to be "as smooth as
sarce and as sweet as maple-candy." The sayings of American old ladies
of the Mrs. Partington type are wonderful, and most of them are
unrecorded. Did you ever hear of the remark of the ancient dame whose
farm-homestead had been alternately ravaged by Federal and Confederate
troops? "North and South," she observed; "it's four pecks o' one and a
bushel o' t' other. I've had 'em both. Longstreet's 'walk' men, and
Wolford's 'critter' men, they both kem around, and, 'twixt the two,
they caved in my ash-hopper that I wouldn't ha' taken two dollars and
a York shilling for." The ash-hopper was all the world to the old
lady.</p>
<p>The amiable imperturbability of the Hon. Edward Everett was
marvellous, and rivalled that of Sheridan, or Sheridan's friend, who,
when he had sent the hot roast goose flying into the lap of the lady
in pink satin, observed that "he would trouble her for that goose when
she had done with it." Nothing ruffled, nothing disturbed Mr. Everett,
He went on, smiling and beaming, beyond three score years and ten like
a Beautiful Image. He was once president of Harvard University; and
there is a story that at one of the "commencements" or commemorations
of that institution a wicked undergraduate who had recently been
expelled contrived to ensconce himself in the musicians' gallery,
which was directly over the dais, and amused himself during the
delivery of the inaugural oration by sprinkling flour on the
presidential head. The Honourable Edward at last became aware of the
farinaceous shower. He just gently inclined his head upwards;
"spotted" the culprit; then, without a word of remonstrance, unfurled
an umbrella; and uttered under that canopy such beautiful sentences
about Moschus, Bion, and the Pilgrim Fathers, that the auditory, who
had been on the broad grin, were hushed to reverential silence. It is
to be hoped that the wicked undergraduate forthwith repented, became a
hermit, and lived for the remainder of his blighted existence on
Greek roots and Congress water....</p></div2>

recollections of his deceased friend, Agostino Ruffini....</p>
<p>Next in interest to this tribute to the dead is Professor Goldwin
Smith's professedly slight and imperfect portrait of a great living
celebrity--President Lincoln. The ludicrous falseness of the popular
estimate of this remarkable man must by this time have become apparent
to all capable of reflection. Mr. Smith has contributed towards the
formation of a better one by some judicious observations; but, in
particular, by simply letting us see how the President is wont to
express himself on great occasions. No man, it must be conceded by all
who read this paper, could have spoken more simply and nobly over the
dead at Gettysburg; more firmly, and at the same time wisely and
moderately, on the question of emancipation; more tersely and
unanswerably than in rebutting the charges of illegal arrests. The
same spirit pervades all these utterances--that of a magistrate
severely conscious of his responsibilities, disinterested, energetic,
circumspect.....</p></div2>

<p>....It is precisely because we are sincerely solicitous for the
abiding welfare of the projected Confederation that we cannot join
some of our contemporaries in flaunting before the eyes of British
Americans the dazzling, but, in our opinion, improbable, prospect of
their one day becoming "the leading Power of the American continent."
It is a dream flattering to British vanity, and countenanced at the
present moment by some American malcontents. The British Americans
will do well not to import from this island the high-flying Imperial
ambition which once swayed Britons so powerfully, but which is now
somewhat out of date and fashion. "The leading Power on the American
continent," whoever it may be, will have the leading debt in the
American continent, will be the most prone to wars of empire, to wars
for a fanciful balance of power, or more probably for a real but
selfish preponderance. Such distinctions as these may be accepted as
the gratuitous gifts of destiny, but are not worth heavy sacrifices
for their attainment.</p>
<p>Still more important to the Confederation than its relations to
Great Britain and France (for we must not forget that Canada has a
hold upon the French heart also) are its relations to its powerful and
excitable neighbour. It is the instinct of danger in this direction
which has so rapidly brought to a head the idea of a British-American
Confederation. President Lincoln has given notice to the British
Government to terminate that stipulation of the treaty of Ghent,
which, in substance forbade the maintenance of a naval force on Lakes
Ontario and Erie. Congress has instructed, or is on the eve of
instructing, the President to give the requisite year's notice of the
termination of the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada. We will fling a
veil of oblivion over General Dix's passionate order, speedily
cancelled as it was by the President. The repeal of the Reciprocity
Treaty alone will exclude American vessels from the navigation of the
Canadian witers, natural and artificial, and place the disabilities of
the American fishing interests on the same footing as they were in
1852, when the American people were excited to a war point by the
simple enforcement of an almost unquestioned British right. The
birthday of the confederation will fall in no halcyon time of
security, but at an epoch when the minds of its citizens are brooding
anxiously about the future of their country and the various forms of
danger to which it may be exposed.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the free-trading interests of the Great West
will eventually outweigh in the political balance the Protectionist
tendencies of the Atlantic States, and that the repeal of one
reciprocity treaty will be only a step towards the conclusion of
another and an amended one. The pungent manifesto of the Detroit Board
of Trade, which has been recently republished in this country, gives
us an assurance that the men of the West will not allow their greatest
commercial interest, the export of grain and its free transit to the
seaboard, to go to the wall. That they will find willing allies in
British American statesmen the following well-conceived resolution
shows:--</p>
<q><p>The communications with the North-Western territory <hi
rend="italic">and the improvements required for the development of the
trade of the</hi> Great West with the seaboard, are regarded by this
Conference as subjects of the highest importance to the Confederation,
and should be prosecuted at the earliest possible period when the
state of the federal finances will permit the Legislature to do
so.</p></q>
<p>The improvements referred to are, we presume, the construction of
the Ottawa Canal and the deepening of the Welland and St. Lawrence
canals. Such being the highly precarious state of the commercial
relations between British America and the United States, it becomes
doubly incumbent on the former to establish that system of entire <hi
rend="italic">intercolonial</hi> free trade which is one of the most
prominent features of the new scheme. The sweeping away of four or
five provincial tariffs will be the best means of indemnifying the
British Americans for the possible loss of a reciprocity treaty with
the American Union.</p>
<p>To carry out this general system of free trade, as well as to
facilitate intercourse between the maritime provinces and Canada, it
is absolutely necessary that the missing links of the intercolonial
railroad, which is to connect Halifax with Quebec, be forthwith
completed. These missing links are two--viz., between Truro, in Nova
Scotia, and Shediac, in New Brunswick; and between Fredericton, N.B.,
and Rivi&#x00E8;re de Loup, the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk
line, 114 miles below Quebec. The construction of this line was
recommended by Lord Durham in his celebrated "Report on the Affairs of
British North America," so early as January, 1839, at a time when the
present gigantic system of American and Canadian railroads ws yet in
embryo. We quote this curious passage:--</p>
<q><p>The completion of any satisfactory communication between Halifax
and Quebec would, in fact, produce relations between these provinces
that would render a general union absolutely necessary. Several
surveys have proved that it would be perfectly practicable the whole
way. It appears to be a general opinion in the United States that the
severe snows and frosts of that continent very slightly impede and do
not prevent the travelling on railroads; and, if I am rightly
informed, <hi rend="italic">the Utica Railroad, in the northern part
of the State of New York, is used throughout the winter</hi>. If this
opinion be correct, the formation of a railroad from Halifax to Quebec
would entirely alter some of the distinguishing characteristics of the
Canadas. Instead of being shut out from all direct intercourse with
England during half the year, they would possess a far more certain
and speedy communication throughout the winter than they now possess
in summer. The passage from Ireland to Quebec would be a matter of ten
or twelve days, and Halifax would be the great port by which a large
portion of the trade, and all the conveyance of passengers to the
whole of British North America, would be carried on....If the great
natural channel of the St. Lawrence gives all the people who dwell in
any part of its basin such an interest in the government of the whole
as renders it wise to incorporate the two Canadas, the artificial work
which would, in fact, supersede the lower part of the St. Lawrence as
the outlet of a great part of the Canadian trade, and would make
Halifax, in a great measure, an outport to Quebec, would surely, in
the same way, render it advisable that the incorporation should be
extended to provinces through which such a road would pass.</p></q>
<p>Although Sir Robert Peel's Government was favourable to this
project, and offered to guarantee 4 per cent interest to the
investors, it has not yet been carried out. The want of it was
grievously felt by the empire in the winter of 1861-2, when the 10,000
British troops made their famous passage on sleighs between
Fredericton and Quebec. The same motives of economy and speed in the
conveyance of troops, military stores, and the mails which have
prompted the Indian Government to guarantee a certain rate of interest
upon the vast sums invested in Indian railroads, has at length
impelled both the Imperial and Colonial Governments to renew their
offers of a guarantee and grant of land to any capitalists who will
supply the missing links in the railroad chain between Halifax and
Quebec. As the surveys have long since been made, and the estimated
outlay is only &#x00A3;3,000,000 for a length of 350 miles, and
inasmuch as its execution is a condition precedent of the proposed
Confederation, we may soon expect to hear of its introduction on the
Stock Exchange....</p></div2>

<p>By the Moravian, we have intelligence from New York to the 28th
ult.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair had returned to Washington, having, it is said,
altogether failed in his peace mission. The Confederate House of
Representatives has unanimously confirmed the resolution to issue an
address to the Southern people announcing the determination of
Congress to continue the war; and at Washington resolutions have been
introduced into the Senate in favour of the continuance of the war
until the South shall make an unconditional submission. So it is clear
that "the end is not yet."</p>
<p>The Federal General Terry had demanded the surrender of Wilmington,
giving General Bragg until the 19th inst. to decide. Opinions differ
as to whether the Confederates would surrender or defend the place. In
the mean time Admiral Porter had occupied all the forts and works
abandoned by the enemy, and was feeling his way up the river.</p>
<p>A Confederate squadron, composed of three ironclads and five
gunboats, and said to have been commanded by Captain Semmes, descended
the James River during the night of the 23rd ult., with the supposed
purpose of surprising the Federal flotilla and destroying General
Grant's stores and transports at City Point. But the Confederate
vessels failed to pass the obstructions laid by the Federals in the
stream. One of them ran aground, and had to be destroyed; and the
others were compelled to return without effecting anything.</p>
<p>General Sherman has received considerable reinforcements, but
nothing definite is known as to his movements.</p>
<p>In the West there have been several movements of detached
expeditions.</p>
<p>The city of New York was to furnish 20,000 recruits under President
Lincoln's last levy; and the Government had refused to reduce the
quota.</p>
<p>President Davis has signed the Congressional resolutions creating
the office of general-in-chief. He has also sent a letter to the
Confederate Congress stating that, when General Lee took the command
of the army of Virginia, he was commanding all the armies of the
Confederate States, but was relieved of the latter command at his own
request. Whenever General Lee finds it practicable to assume the chief
command without withdrawing from the direct command of the army of
Virginia, Mr. Davis will deem it conducive to the public interest to
place him in that position. General Johnston has been reinstated, and
appointed, it is said, to the command of the Confederate army in the
West.</p>
<p>President Davis has written a long letter in which he argues
against separate State action, and also agaanst the project of a
convention of all the States of the Confederacy and of the Union.</p>
<p>The New York oil "diggings" promise to become as remunerative as
those of Pennsylvania or West Virginia, and Cattaraugus County is fast
becoming the Mecca of those who hasten to be rich.</p>
<p>The Senate has ratified the treaties with the north-western bands
of Shoshoonee Indians establishing peace and friendship, the several
bands stipulating that hostilities and all depredations upon the
emigrant-trains, the mail and telegraph lines, and upon citizens of
the United States within their country, shall cease. The boundaries of
their country, as claimed and occupied by them, are thus given by the
<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>:--On the north, by the middle
of the Great Desert; on the west, by Steptue Valley; on the south, by
Toedon or Green Mountains; and on the east, by the Great Salt Lake,
Tuilla, and Rush Valleys. The Indians agree to remove to the
reservations whenever the President shall deem it expedient for them
to do so, and become herdsmen or agriculturists, the Government paying
them certain annuities in money, provisions, and goods. The Indians
also agree that the Pacific Railroad shall not be molested; that
military posts, &#x0026;c., may be constructed, the gold and silver
mines worked, and mining and agricultural settlements formed, and
rancheros established wherever they may be required.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government and Parliament are taking high ground in
the matter of the St. Albans outrages. Judge Coursol has been
suspended, and a bill introduced to make good the fifty thousand
dollars which were returned to the raiders on their release. In the
opening debate in Parliament the Government was sustained by a large
majority, and the conduct of the Southern refugees in Canada strongly
denounced. A determination was expressed to stop the abuse of
asylum. The Government is carrying out a general draught in order to

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">TUESDAY</hi>.</p>
<p>The seventh session of the present Parliament was opened by
Commission. The ceremony was a very simple one. A few ladies assembled
in the House of Lords and occupied the back seats usually taken by the
peers. In the galleries there were also a few ladies. As soon as the
Royal Commissioners entered, the Lord Chancellor directed the Usher of
the Black Rod to summon the House of Commons, and in a few moments
afterwards the Speaker, in his state robes and accompanied by a few
members of the House of Commons, appeared at the bar. The Lord
Chancellor then read the</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Queen'S Speech.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lords And Gentlemen,</hi></p>
<p>We are commanded to assure you that her Majesty has great
satisfaction in recurring again to the advice and assistance of her
Parliament....</p>
<p>The civil war in North America still unhappily continues. Her
Majesty remains steadfastly neutral between the contending parties,
and would rejoice at a friendly reconciliation between them....</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Debate On The Address In Reply
To The Royal Speech.</hi></p>
<p>The House resumed at five o'clock, when, the Speech from the Throne
having been again read,</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Charlemont</hi> (in the absence of
the Duke of Cleveland, owing to domestic breavement) moved the Address
in reply to the Royal Speech. Having adverted to the principal
questions to which the attention of Parliament had been called, he
read some statistics referring to the condition of Ireland to prove
the gradual progress of that country, and maintained that though some
persons and parties were dissatisfied, the people were generally
loyal.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Houghton</hi> seconded the motion. After
referring to the treaty with France of 1852 and the confederation of
the British North American provinces, he defended her Majesty's
Government from the charge of having violated its neutrality in the
civil war now waging in America. He denied that in any one instance it
had ever departed from the policy of non-interference it had declared
it would observe. As to the relations of England to foreign nations
generally, he pointed out the important fact that wherever England was
in arms it was entirely in self-defence. The domestic legislation in
which they were asked to engage in the present Session would, he
assumed, be of the same kind as that of former years. The measures to
be proposed to them would mostly be of a practical character. He had
hoped that in some manner they would have succeeded in broadening the
basis of the Parliamentary representation; but that work was, perhaps,
reserved for another and more ardent generation. He hoped, however,
that some progress would be made in preparing a digest of the law of
England, a measure that certainly ought to receive serious
attention.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> described the Speech
from the Throne as just the sort of speech that was likely to be
addressed by an aged minister to a moribund Parliament, whose
dissolution no event can postpone; so that all its experienced
advisers could do was to find it some gentle occupation and take care
that its dying moments were not disturbed by any unnecessary
excitement; whilst its physicians held the usual consultation and
pocketed their accustomed fees. The noble Earl then adverted to our
relations with Brazil and the civil war in America, calling attention
to the ingratitude with which the neutrality of this country had been
met by the Government of Washington, who had given notice to terminate
the Reciprocity Treaty and the agreement for securing the neutrality
of the American lakes. Under these circumstances the noble Earl said
he regarded with satisfaction the proposed confederation of the
British North American provinces. He alluded to the distress in the
cotton districts, pointing out the condition of those districts; and
expressed his regret that legislation had not been determined upon as
the result of the Public Schools Commission.</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi> congratulated their
Lordships upon the good sense and good humour displayed by the Earl of
Derby, and congratulated the latter upon the brilliant success which
had attended his literary labours during the recess. Referring to the
notice given by the Government at Washington to terminate the
Reciprocity Treaty with England, he stated his belief that it was to
be traced to irritation consequent upon the movements of Confederate
raiders, but that there was still time for negotiation.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Leitrim</hi>, having spoken on the
Irish portion of the Speech,</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> stated his pleasure at
finding that there was a general approval of the House of the foreign
policy of the Government; but in answer to observations of Lord Derby
on the diplomatic rupture with Brazil, he denied that the Foreign
Office was to blame, or could have taken any other course than they
had adopted. As regarded American politics, he urged that the United
States expected that her Majesty's Government should do all that the
law of nations and international law required to prevent any aid being
given to the Confederates; but it had been impossible to prevent acts
by British subjects, which had caused great irritation in America,
such as the fitting out of ships in English ports to prey on the
commerce of the United States. In Canada also Confederate agents had
done acts calculated to embroil this country with the United States,
and it was not surprising that the Federal Government, seeing the
Canadian lake made use of for such purposes, should be inclined to
take steps to put a stop to such proceedings. While, however, her
Majesty's Government would adhere strictly to neutrality in the
American contest, they would not admit claims on this country which
were not founded on justice.</p>
<p>The Address was then agreed to.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">My Diary in America in the Midst of War.</hi> By
G. A. Sala. (Tinsley.) Mr. Sala's peculiar powers appear to the
greatest possible advantage in these two volumes; and the only
consequence is that there has not been published for many a long day a
book more full of entertainment and amusement. His keen faculty of
observation had full scope; his talent for minute description was
taxed to its utmost; his ability to place both persons and things in
the most stirking light was freely exercised; his intimate
acquaintance with popular taste had a chance of showing itself; his
brilliant colouring had a fine opening for application; his
appreciation of humour did him excellent service; his capacious memory
or his punctual notification supplied him with copious stores of
anecdote; and his epigrammatic style of writing gave a pungent flavour
to the sentences which flowed from his pen. It must be remembered,
however, that the greater part of that which is contained in his two
volumes was written in the form of letters to a newspaper which has,
perhaps, the largest circulation of all daily publications in England,
if not in the world. The remembrance of this fact will enable the
reader to understand not only why Mr. Sala frequently speaks of
himself as "the subscriber," but also why he should have been accused
by the Americans (particularly those of extreme Northern principles)
of misrepresentation. For it is plain that he must have given ready
ear to what would be likely to amuse and to gratify his readers and to
increase the circulation of the paper for which he had undertaken his
pilgrimage; and how well Mr. Sala fulfilled his objects, let those
many admirers testify who purchased the <hi rend="italic">Daily
Telegraph</hi> simply for the pleasure to be derived from his
letters. Now, experience will tell you that there is nothing so
delightful as to have pointed out to you the mote in your neighbour's
eye; and in this respect Mr. Sala has been a most conscientious as
well as humorous showman. He would, of course, have scouted the idea
of putting upon paper what he had neither seen nor heard; but he would
naturally repeat not only what he saw but what he heard that was
likely, from its grotesqueness to convulse with laughter, from its
folly to put upon good terms with themselves, and from its horribility
to interest as well as shock his readers. In fact, the "chiel" who
"takes notes" in a foreign country nearly always does so in the spirit
of a censor. Hence the charge against Mr. Sala of misrepresentation,
by which is probably meant an unconsciously, perhaps, partial, but
still a partial, representation. A man who spends but a year in a
large country cannot gain an insight into its interior economy; he
gets but the public--which is usually the worse--view of it; and
Mr. Sala, so far as we can discover, does not seem to have penetrated
far, if at all, into American private society.  Nathaniel Hawthorne,
who lived amongst us in time of peace far longer than Mr. Sala lived
amongst the Americans in time of war, found occasion to apply the lash
to us and, though he did not lay it on with the rigour displayed by
Mr. Sala, even Nathaniel Hawthorne has been accused of
misrepresentation. However, that the Americans are not so black as
they have (not by Mr. Sala) been painted is proved by the fact that
Mr. Sala, in spite of his "misrepresentation," was not subjected to
the American amenities of cowhiding, tar-and-feathering, or gratuitous
riding upon a rail. He bit them hard, and they winced; but they took
no ruffianly vengeance such as they are reported to be in the habit of
taking. One is pained at Mr. Sala's views on the negro question; but,
on the whole, one is inclined to look upon his picture as a faithful
representation of matters as they appeared to a writer who was far
from a "Northern sympathiser," who was on the look out for literary
capital, and who was expected to make of his capital the most that he
possibly could. Mr. Sala was, of course, dependent to a considerable
extent upon hearsay, but it will be profitable in the interest of
truth to compare what he says at p. 361 and. at p. 377, vol. ii, with
what has been written about Sherman's barbarity in driving out the
inhabitants from Atlanta and about the composition of the Northern
armies. We read with respect to the former, "all the inhabitants who
were able fled from before the dreaded Yankees," from which one would
infer that there was no great hardship in removing those who would
have gone had they been able, and that Hood's letter to Sherman was
mere "tabu talk;" and with respect to the latter, "the best blood, the
best bone, the best sinew, of the Northern States have already been
offered up to this Moloch. There is scarcely a Unionist family--from
that of the millionaire merchant to that of the petty farmer and
store-keeper--which has not sent a son, a brother, and often even a
father and bread-winner to the war;" from which one would infer that
the Northern armies are not entirely or even principally, composed of
"Irish and German mercenaries." It is true that Sherman's reply to
Hood does not quite bear out the inference we have said might be
drawn, so that Mr. Sala's account may not be literally correct; but as
regards the composition of the Union armies, Mr. Sala is as likely to
be well informed as any other "special correspondent" or
"commissioner," and it is desirable, whatever one's individual
sympathies may be, that truth should not be sacrificed to prejudice
and passion.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE NEGRO IN AMERICA.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">The coloured man</hi>," said Mr. Frederick
Douglas, the eloquent negro orator, at a lecture which he recently
delivered in New York, "<hi rend="italic">is the master of the
situation. Upon whichever side he shall declare himself, on that side
will be the victory</hi>." Mr. Douglas knows his people, and does not
exaggerate the importance of their action in the mighty struggle, of
which their emancipation was the pretext rather than the cause; and,
knowing them so well, his opinion that they will fight for their
masters, on the promise of freedom to themselves and families; that
they will not, as some abolitionists have predicted, turn their arms
against the cause in which their services are enlisted; but that, on
the contrary, they will zealously, faithfully, and bravely earn their
liberty on the terms proposed, is entitled to the respect which all
opinion founded upon knowledge claims from every rational man. As the
South, under the pressure of military necessity, is about to make this
vital experiment, for the sake of replenishing the ranks of its
dwindling and decimated armies, the time is favourable for a review of
the progress already made in the emancipation of the coloured race. As
a preliminary to the full comprehension of the subject, it should be
steadily borne in mind that the South, though it has always been
pro-slavery, has always been pro-negro; and that the North has, in
like manner, been anti-slavery and anti-negro. The South has
maintained that it was a good thing for America that the negroes
should remain in it and increase and multiply, and that it was a
better thing for the negro that he should be a slave than a free
man. The North, on the other hand, has maintained as strenuously that
slavery was an abomination, an outrage, and a crime; but that, all
things considered, it was a very bad thing for America that the negro
race had ever been introduced into it; and that if slavery were an
evil, free blacks were evils almost, if not quite, as flagrant. Social
prejudice set up and still insists on this preposterous claim. The
result is that throughout the North, the negro is systematically
repressed and deprived of social position and political privilege by
the tyranny of custom and the nameless operation of social laws. In
some of the States in the West neither negro slavery nor negroes are
allowed to exist, and in Illinois, if not in Indiana, it is a penal
offence for a coloured man to cross their borders and presume that he
has any right to dwell among his white superiors. The negroes of the
North feel this social excommunication more acutely than the negroes
of the South feel the oppression of slavery. In the South the white
man does not hate the negro, nor the negro the white man; while in the
North the love felt by antislavery agitators and others for the negro
is purely theoretical and political, and not in the slightest degree
social; while the opinion entertained by the negroes of their white
"friends," who talk so much and do so little in their behalf, is of
the kind which most men entertain towards palpable
hypocrisy. Mr. Lincoln once told a deputation of negroes that the best
thing they and their race could do would be to take themselves out of
the country, to go back to Africa, or drift down into Central
America. Mr. Douglas, speaking for his race, declares that they will
do nothing of the kind; that they will not be "improved off the face
of the earth," like the red Indians; that they have found a home in
America, and that they will keep it; and that their true place is
among friendly, and not among hostile, white people. Possibly, and
very probably, the result of Northern love for emancipation and of
dislike for the negro may be, if the South should achieve or help to
achieve its independence by the aid of the coloured people, that the
Northern negroes will gradually, if not collectively, migrate to the
South, attracted by the superior congeniality of the climate. In the
North their natural increase is not so great as in the South; in fact,
if their numbers were not augmented by fugitives from slavery, they
would die out as a people in a certain calculable length of time, as
may be discovered from the fact that the annual number of deaths among
them is greater than that of the births.</p>
<p>The South hold the doctrine that the Federal Government had neither
the right nor the power to abolish slavery, but that the only agency
which could effect the purpose was the lawful and Constitutional
legislation of the States in which the institution
existed. Mr. Lincoln, for military reasons and for State necessity,
abolished slavery by proclamation and by stroke of the pen as the Pope
would abolish heresy by an encyclical letter. But slavery remained
unaffected by his fulminations and only perished in districts where
his armies were able to penetrate, holding its own as firmly elsewhere
as if he had never issued his proclamation against it. And now, in the
fourth year of the war, though slavery is falling right and left, it
is not because of his proclamation, but because the Border States of
Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri have, in their sovereign
capacity, resolved to abolish in Congress, which is ready to indorse
all Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds, finding the futility of
"proclamations" or "edicts" of military power, debates an amendment to
the Federal Constitution--a document which permits slavery, but which,
if the amendment shall pass, it will tolerate no longer. And more
effectual than anything that the North can do or propose, the South
takes measures not alone to emancipate its slaves, but to elevate them
in the social scale, and link the fortunes of the white man and the
black by the ties of mutual interest and reciprocal gratitude. The
black man man in the North is free, but a pariah. In the South, it is
probable that the black man who shall have served in the Confederate
army will be free, and as much of a man as soldiership and the respect
of his white contemporaries can make him.</p>
<p>It would appear from a consideration of all these circumstances
that the emancipation of the slaves is more likely to be
satisfactorily effected by the Southern than by the Northern
people. So passionately does the North love the Union, so immense are
the sacrifices of pride, as well as of material resources, that it is
prepared to make for its darling object, that, were the South to
declare that it would lay down its arms on the sole condition of the
maintenance of slavery by the whole force of the united Governments,
the majority of the North would in all probability accede to the
proposal. The negroes know the fact; and such men as Douglas give very
significant hints at all available opportunities that they will not
consent to be played with by either side, but will make their own
bargain whenever they think they have arrived at the decisive moment
of the struggle. There can be little doubt that the South can be of
greater benefit to them than the North; that the South, by reason of
its climate, is a better home for people of their blood than the
frozen regions of New York, New England, or the great North-West; and
that, under a properly-organised system of labour which would be
necessary to prevent them from becoming paupers in becoming free men,
the South, if it should be recognised among the independent nations of
the earth, would be enabled, by means of its freed negroes, to develop
its immense sources more rapidly than it was ever able to do under the
system of slavery; and that, finally, slavery would disappear
altogether. Should, however, the South be conquered, the question of
the negro as well as the question of slavery will not be so easily
settled. Slavery may be abolished, but the Northern overseer will take
the place of the Southern master, the relations of the races will be
as unkindly throughout the whole Union as they now are in the North,
and the poor negro will be fortunate if he escape in the sequel the
fate of other races that could not be enslaved and as a consequence
were exterminated.</p></div2>

<p>A pleasant hit at the neck-and-neck race of extravagance which the
two powers Shoddy and Petroleum are running in the States is thus made
in a paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">New York
Tribune</hi>:--Mrs. A., accompanied by Mrs. B., recently paid a visit
to Tiffany's, and bought there, aided by her friend's counsel, a
stylish assortment of jewellery for her own proper wearing. Before
they had quite concluded their purchases a stranger, whom we will call
Mrs. C., came in, and, after requiring the services of half the
attendants, bought a far more extensive and costly assortment of
richly set precious stones, for the adornment of her
person. Whereupon: Mrs. A. to Mrs. B. (in an undertone), "Evidently
Shoddy." Mrs. C. (overhearing), "No, Madam, Petroleum."--Another story
of the same kind is told. A young lady in Pennsylvania informed her
lover that the match must be broken off. "Why?" gasped the unfortunate
lover. "Dad has struck oil," replied the damsel, determined not to
lose her chance of a better match.</p></div2>

<p>The latest news from New York is to the morning of the 5th
inst. Accounts of the opening of peace negotiations between the
Federals and the Confederates, and of their complete failure, reached
us almost simultaneously. The Canada, which arrived during Tuesday
night from Boston and Halifax, brought the news that three Confederate
Commissioners--Vice-President stephens, Senator Hunter, and Judge
Campbell--had arrived at Fort Monroe on the 2nd inst., in order to
discuss peace unofficially; that Secretary Seward had gone to Fort
Monroe to meet them; and that President Lincoln himself had left
Washington for Fort Monroe in consequence of a telegram from
Mr. Seward. This important<pb n="151"/> news was brought to us by New
York despatches to the afternoon of the 8rd inst. The Hibernian, which
arrived on Wednesday evening, brought, however, telegraphic news from
New York to the morning of the 5th inst., to the effect that the peace
conference between President Lincoln, Mr. Seward, and the Confederate
Commissioners has proved a failure, and that both Governments remain
as they were. President Lincoln and Secretary Seward had returned to
Washington; and a secret session of the Cabinet had been held
there. The Associated Press despatches state that President Lincoln
and Mr. Seward had an informal conference with Messrs. Hunter,
Stephens, and Campbell, on board a steamer at Hampton Roads, which
lasted four hours; and it is positively known that it resulted in no
change in the attitude of either government. In other words, it was a
failure.</p>
<p>The war news is not important. There had been no operations in the
neighbourhood of Richmond; and the Confederate squadron had retired up
the James River. Part of the Federal fleet had left the Cape Fear
River for Charleston; and it would seem from Confederate accounts that
the Federals had assembled their troops near Fort Fisher, and had
probably abandoned for a time active operations against the town of
Wilmington. The main body of General Sherman's army had crossed the
Savannah River, and commenced on the 17th ult. its march, in three
columns, through South Carolina towards Charleston and Branchville,
but had experienced great difficulties at the outset in consequence of
heavy rains, which had rendered the swamps impassable. Federal
accounts stated that General Sherman was within forty miles of
Charleston, that General Foster was co-operating with him, and that
the Confederates were offering resistance at every point but were
being rapidly driven from all their defensive positions. Confederate
despatches, however, asserted that all General Sherman's efforts to
cross the Combahee River had hitherto failed. A number of steamers had
been sent from Cairo up the Tennessee and Cumberland River for the
purpose, as it was said, of removing General Thomas's army to "a new
base." The Confederate General Hill had announced that, in case of
need, all the cotton stored in Augusta would be burned, even though
the burning might cause the destruction of the city; and the Richmond
papers stated that measures had been taken to destroy all cotton in
Georgia and the Carolinas whenever it might be in danger of falling
into the Federals' hands.</p>
<p>President Davis has appointed the 10th of March as a day of fast
and prayer. The Confederate Congress was considering a bill for the
impressment of 40,000 negroes for "menial service" with the army, and
had rejected an amendment providing that none of them should at any
time be armed and employed as soldiers. General Breckenridge has been
appointed Confederate Secretary for War.</p>
<p>The Federal War Department has arranged to exchange with the South
all prisoners now in close confinement or in irons.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter has made a special report to the Federal Government
on the monitors. He says they behaved better in rough weather when off
Fort Fisher than any of the rest of the fleet, though they became very
uncomfortable for the officers and men, shipping much water. On one of
his ironclads the Admiral gets quite eloquent. He says:--"The
Monadnock is capable of crossing the ocean alone (when her compasses
are once adjusted properly), and could destroy any vessel in the
French or British navy, lay their towns under contribution, and return
again (provided she could pick up coal) without fear of being
followed. She could certainly clear any harbour on our coast of
blockaders in case we were at war with a foreign Power."</p>
<p>General Butler had made a speech at Lowell, in which he fiercely
attacked Admiral Porter, and especially General Grant, whom he charged
with preventing an exchange of prisoners with the South and with
lavishly wasting the blood of his troops. As to himself, he hoped that
when he died his epitaph might be--"Here lies the General who saved
the lives of his soldiers at Big Bethel and Fort Fisher, and who never
commanded the army of the Potomac."</p>
<p>A joint resolution submitting to the decision of the State
Legislatures the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery
throughout the United States has passed the House of Representatives,
amid great enthusiasm, by 119 ayes to 56 noes. The Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Western Virginia Legislatures and the
New York Assembly have ratified the constitutional amendment and it
has been ratified in Illinois and Rhode Island by the Lower Houses. In
the Senate Mr. Sumner has introduced resolutions declaring the consent
of the rebel States to the measure to be unnecessary while they are in
rebellion; and the Senate has passed joint resolutions declaring
Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee,
not entitled to representation in the Electoral College. President
Lincoln has been serenaded at Washington, when he made a speech, in
which he said that the passage of the amendment abolishing slavery was
an occasion of congratulation for the whole world. He thought the
measure was a fitting if not indispensable adjunct to the winding up
of the great difficulty. He wished the re-union of the States to be so
effected as to remove all causes of future disturbance. "The
emancipating proclamation," said Mr. Lincoln, "falls short of what the
amendment will effect when consummated."</p>
<p>The Senate has passed the retaliation resolutions, with the
amendment that the retaliation should be in conformity with the usages
of war among civilised nations.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill for the
construction of a ship canal around the Niagara Falls, and also for
the Illinois-Michigan Canal. The latter will enable gun-boats to pass
from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton has ordered the re-annexation of Arizona to the Pacific
department, under General Macdowell. The limits of the Southern
department are intended to embrace North Carolina.</p>
<p>A coloured lawyer has been admitted to the bar of the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>The peace negotiations diminished the premium on gold at New York
to about 105 per cent; but it rose again to about 113 per cent on the
4th inst., when the failure of those negotiations became known.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government has given up Burleigh, the Confederate
partisan who seized a steamer on Lake Erie, for trial in the United
States; and the Canadian Legislature has almost unanimously passed the
Alien Bill introduced by the Colonial Ministry. This bill provides
that, on complaint of a resident, the Governor-General may order
aliens to quit the Provinces, after giving them notice, through the
<hi rend="italic">Official Gazette</hi>, of their intended
expulsion. The accused may, however, tender reasons for
non-compliance.</p>
<p>Te report of Colonel Jervois respecting the defences of Canada has
been published. Colonel Jervois is of opinion that if Montreal and
Quebec were placed in a condition for defence, and the river between
Montreal and Quebec commanded by iron-plated vessels, a successful
resistance could be made to any attempt to subjugate the country, so
long as Great Britain had the command of the sea. The defence of Upper
Canada is, in his opinion, more difficult. Even there, however, points
are to be found--for instance, Kingston, Toronto, and and
Hamilton--which, if properly fortified, would offer a most serious, if
not effectual, resistance to an enemy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">WILMINGTON AND THE CAPE FEAR RIVER,<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">North Carolina.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Map of Wilmington and the Cape Fear
River, which appears on the following page, will doubtless have a
peculiar interest for our readers, as placing before them the some of
Admiral Porter's recent successes. The subjoined particulars have been
furnished by a correspondent direct from "Dixie's Land," who was
during four days, an eye-witness of the bombardment of Fort Fisher,
and to whom a three months' previous residence at Wilmington had given
many facilities for procuring the latest and most reliable
information. The port of Wilmington, North Carolina, is situated about
twenty miles north of the New Inlet entrance to the Cape Fear
River. It is about four miles long and three miles broad, numbering
nearly 6000 inhabitants, of whom two thirds are negroes. The streets
are built at right angles, and contain many handsome edifices, among
which the City Hall, the Custom House, and the marble mansion of
J. A. Taylor, a wealthy Northerner, are the most
conspicuous. Wilmington, however, owes its notoriety to having been
the principal port of rendezvous for blockade-runners since the
closing of Charleston Harbour. In spite of the vigilance of the
Federal cruisers--there were on an average eighteen blockading the
different entrances--as many as 164 runners successfully passed in and
out in the twelve months elapsing between Oct. 1, 1863, and Oct. 1,
1864. The value of imports, through the blockade, for the year ending
June 30, 1864, was 3,276,000 dols.; and of exports, 65,185,000
dols.--figures not even attained in prosperous times before the war,
when imports were almost nil, and exports consisted only of lumber,
resin, turpentine, and farm produce. There are two approaches to the
Cape Fear River, one at the New Inlet navigable for vessels not
drawing more than 9 ft., and one at the Western Bar, between Smith and
Oak Island, where the depth varies from 9 ft. to 13 ft. To the extreme
left of Oak Island (not visible in the map) is Fort Camel; and in a
straight line with it, on Smith's Island, below Bald Head Light, is
Fort Holmes. These two forts formerly commanded the channel, and kept
the Federal cruisers at bay when chasing a blockade-runner too close
to the bar. Caswell, a very strong, casemated earthwork, has been
blown up by the Confederates, as also the batteries on Smith's Island,
and Forts Johnson and Pender, one above, the other below
Smithville. Fort Fisher, against which Admiral Porter's attack was
directed, forms the key to the channel. The inner (direct) distance
from Fort Fisher to Caswell is eight miles, but to go round by the
Frying Pan Shoals, it is sixty-two miles. The fort itself is described
as "an enormous mound of sand"; but it mounted seventy-five guns,
Brook's rifled, protected by traverses, with bombproof casemates
below. The best instance of its extraordinary strength is that it
sustained a continuous bombardment of twenty-one days, for the attack
commenced on the 14th of December and terminated only on the 14th of
January. The banks all along the river, as far as Wilmington, and some
distance beyond, are protected by formidable masked batteries; and
torpedoes and other obstructions--piles and wrecks--have been laid
down in the channel by the Confederates, to impede navigation. Even
before the arrival of the Northern armada, that portion of the river
between Fort St. Philip and Fort French required the utmost skill and
caution to pilot a vessel of any width through without running aground
or against some hidden danger. Although secret information reached
Wilmington as early as the 18th of December of the departure of the
Federal fleet from Fortress Monroe, the military authorities in
command so little expected an invasion that there were only 400
effective soldiers in the town, and a little over 200 in Fort Fisher
when the shelling began. The Federal forces are now before Half Moon
Battery, about fifteen miles below Wilmington; and, as possession of
the town is of great importance to them--it commands the high roads to
Charleston and Petersburg--they are sure to use strenuous exertions to
effect its capture; and this we may expect to hear of by next mail,
the Confederates not being prepared for hostile demonstrations in that
quarter before spring, nor able to spare sufficient troops for a
lengthened resistance.</p></div2>

saturday, February</hi> 18, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the early part of the week came news
from America which excited legitimate hope that the combatants were
weary of the war. We were informed that agents from the South had been
empowered to meet the heads of the Federal Government, and to discuss
terms of compromise. We also learned that the authorities at
Washington had consented to receive these Confederate gentlemen, and
that a meeting had actually taken place. President Lincoln, having
previously dispatched Mr. Seward to Hampton Roads, went thither
himself, and met Messrs. Hunter, Campbell, and Stephens on board a
steamer, and it is said that their "informal conference" lasted for
four hours. The last mail confirms the intelligence that the meeting
has been without a result, and that the parties have returned to their
respective abodes.</p>
<p>We find ourselves unconsciously lingering over this detail, though
it is a vain one. How gladly should we have narrated every incident in
the history had we been able to end it with the intimation that the
heads of a treaty had been agreed upon. There was not an
honest-hearted man in England who did not hail the intelligence of the
early part of the week with satisfaction, and, indeed, with
gladness. It was felt that the period was opportune for
pacification. The Northern armies had accomplished splendid. things,
and had so triumphantly vindicated the claim of the Federals to
superiority of force that they could well afford to close the game,
and leave the South unsubdued, and proud of the gallant soldiery that
had held the capital against all corners. There was no loss of honour
to the Confederates in giving in when every one of their ports was
closed; for they were like to a brave garrison that had yielded to the
power of the assailants to draw lines all round the fortress. On the
great question of slavery, too, there seemed now but little on which
the antagonists need contend; for while the North had for the second
time confirmed the decree of freedom, the South had virtually conceded
the same boon, by preparing to place arms in the hands of the negroes
and giving them liberty in exchange for their services in the field of
battle. There remained, as we thought, an admirable subject of debate,
or <hi rend="italic">pi&#x00E8;ce de resistance</hi>, on which
treaty-makers might expend all their rhetoric and superfluous energy,
and do battle with a not unwise hypocrisy, because such discussions
would lead men's minds away from the savage feelings of war, and this
was the financial question which has been so often declared to have
been the rock on which the ship Union really split. Throwing aside
State rights and an absolute Union until the promise of peace should
have made men so resolved upon it that there could be no danger of the
failure of the negotiations, the emissaries from the South and the
authorities from Washington might have talked tariff until the minds
of all were prepared for constitutional debate and the resumption of
friendly relations.</p>
<p>It was not to be. Englishmen will again be told, both by South and
North, that we sordid islanders have never been able to attain to the
true estimate of an idea, The North will jeer us for thinking that it
would ever give up the glorious fiction of Union; the South will ask
us indignantly whether we believe that it would be content with the
fact of independence unless it had the name also. And we can only
reply that we are practical people, and are well satisfied to dispense
with names when we can have things, and that we do not care to fight
when nothing is to be gained by fighting. We know that a real Union,
such as is dreamed of by the more sanguine Federals, is an
impossibility; and that nothing can blend and fuse provinces which are
really distinct nations, with different customs, creeds and objects,
into one harmonious whole. But the honour of the North might have been
conserved by a treaty arrangement that should conserve the mighty
idea. We know that the South must, unless foreign aid be granted, ere
long succumb to the overwhelming power, numbers, and resources of its
enemies, and that it cannot, therefore, demand a formal recognition of
independence; but it has, by its gallantry, and by the terrible
obstacles which it will for a long time be able to throw in the way of
the Federals, earned the right to a real liberty, which might have
been assured to it, informally, by a little judicious diplomacy. We
may be taunted with the smallness of these views; but when we consider
that our small scheme would instantly have checked the flow of blood
and speedily have arrested the flow of treasure, while giving both
parties all that they could reasonably desire, and that the grand
ideas of each side have caused the negotiators to separate and the
signal to be given for new slaughter and new expenditure, we are not
so much ashamed of our insular pettiness as we probably ought to
be. At all events, we are anxious to assure our American brethren on
both sides that we hailed the tidings of possible peace with a
satisfaction for which some of them will not give us credit, and that
it was not a wild and childish greediness for good news that made us
receive the intelligence so eagerly. We had thought over the
situation, and perceived, as we believed, that it was far from an
unhopeful one, both champions being in honourable attitudes, and the
real causes of the war having been absorbed. We had therefore some
right to be bitterly disappointed when the second mail told us that
all has been in vain. Not quite in vain, however, for it is a good
thing that the peace idea has so far made its way that Mr. Lincoln can
meet the ambassadors of Mr. Davis. Let us hope that they may soon meet
again, and to better purpose.</p></div2>

good effect. He did not, however, consider, looking at all the
circumstances of the matter, that the notice to terminate the
convention could be construed into an exhibition of hostile feeling
towards this country. Certain things had taken place of which the
United States' Government had reason to complain; and if they could by
any means protect the property of their citizens they were surely
justified in so doing. With regard to the Reciprocity Treaty, no
official notice could be given to terminate it until the 15th of
March, when the fixed period of ten years would have
elasped....</p>

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 11th inst., when gold
was quoted at 204 1/8.</p>
<p>President Lincoln and President Davis have both communicated to<pb
n="175"/> their respective Congresses the result of the late Peace
Conference at Fort Monroe; and they agree in stating that President
Lincoln refused to recognise in any way the Southern Confederacy, or
to make peace on any other terms than the unconditional return of the
South to the Union.</p>
<p>President Lincoln's account of the negotiations was received in
Congress on the 10th. It is of considerable length, and is very
complete in its details, narrating the circumstances of Mr. Blair's
visit to Richmond, and supplying all the despatches preliminary to the
meeting of the President with the Confederate Commissioners in Hampton
Roads, as well as giving a report of the proceedings of the Conference
itself. Though Mr. Blair went to Richmond with the consent of the
Government, he had no authority to speak or act for it. Mr. Davis sent
a letter by him expressing his willingness to send or receive
Commissioners, and Mr. Lincoln subsequently stated his willingness to
receive gentlemen informally chosen on behalf of the Confederates,
with the object of securing peace on the basis of an undivided
country. Before the Confederate commissioners were met by the
President they were given to understand that the negotiations were to
be informal, and that no proposition which in the slightest degree
contemplated a recognition of the Confederate States could be for a
moment entertained. During the conference Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,
and Campbell endeavoured to effect an agreement for an armistice, but
were informed by Mr. Lincoln that there could be no suspension of
hostilities till the Confederates had disbanded their armies and
acknowledged their allegiance to the national Government, and also
that there could be no recession on the slavery question. General
Grant had been previously instructed not to allow the presence of the
Southern agents within his lines to cause any delay in his military
operations. President Lincoln's account of the peace mission concludes
in the following terms:--</p>
<q><p>On the morning of the 3rd the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens,
Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview
with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No
question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or
mentioned. No other person was present, no papers were exchanged or
produced, and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be
informal and verbal merely. On our part, the whole substance of the
instructions to the Secretary of State, hereinbefore recited, was
stated and insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith;
while, by the other party, it was not said that in any event or on any
condition would they ever consent to reunion; and yet they equally
omitted to declare that they would so consent. They seemed to desire a
postponement of that question, and the adoption of some other course
first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not lead
to reunion, but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite
postponement. The conference ended without result. The foregoing,
containing, as is believed, all the information sought, is
respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Executive Mansion, Feb. 10, 1865.  <hi rend="smallcaps">Abraham
Lincoln.</hi></p></q>
<p>Some of the New York journals have expressed an opinion that the
way is now opened to a further and perhaps more successful conference;
but the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the organ of the Government,
says that "there is nothing left but a vigorous prosecution of the
war, and that, with full ranks and a full treasury, sixty days will
suffice to kill the rebellion."</p>
<p>War is equally the cry of the Confederates. At a mass meeting
convoked by the Governor of Virginia, held at Richmond, at which
President Davis was present, resolutions were unanimously passed
spurning the terms proposed by Mr. Lincoln and expressing the
determination of the Southern people to maintain the war to the last
extremity. Richmond journals scout all ideas of peace, and advocate
fighting it through. General Lee has expressed himself as
follows:--"Any compromise of our struggle would only prove a truce or
armistice, and would only be an unmanly shrinking from present duty
that would entail upon our children untold disaster." The Legislature
of Texas had passed resolutions declaring their determinatfon to
accept no peace that did not guarantee independence.</p>
<p>General Grant's army is no longer mudbound. On the 5th inst. two
divisions of his army moved, one along the Weldon Railroad, towards
Reams station, the other to the left to Hatcher's Run, a short
distance from the Southside Railroad. The Confederates were driven
from their rifle-pits, and the Federals intrenched themselves in the
position they had won. They captured a large commissariat train. On
the 6th and 7th Grant put out his forces to the left still more, and,
though they sustained a "temporary repulse," with the loss of more
than a thousand men, they succeeded finally in establishing their
position, and occupied four miles beyond their former
lines. Substantially this is corroborated by General Lee, who adds
that General Pegram was killed. A rumour prevailed that this movement
was intended as a cover to an advance on Wilmington by General Terry,
at the head of a large force.</p>
<p>General Sherman appears to be steadily pushing forward. One of his
columns was moving on Branchville, and there was a rumour afloat
(lacking confirmation, however) to the effect that it was
taken. Another column was moving towards Charleston.</p>
<p>Movements of troops in other parts are rumoured, but nothing
definite concerning them is known.</p>
<p>An arrangement had been made for a general exchange of prisoners
between the belligerents.</p>
<p>General Lee has appealed to the Southern people for carbines,
pistols, revolvers, and saddles for the equipment of an additional
cavalry force.</p>
<p>The Confederate Senate has almost unanimously rejected the bill for
putting 20,000 negroes into the Confederate army. The Senate has also
confirmed the appointment of Mr. Breckinridge as Secretary for War;
and has passed a vote of thanks to Mr. John Lancaster, the owner of
the Deerhound, for rescuing Captain Semmes and his officers from the
Alabama.</p>
<p>Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Maine, in addition to the States
mentioned last week, have ratified the constitutional amendment
abolishing slavery; but it has been rejected by Delaware. The Governor
of Kentucky has recommended its adoption, but thinks the Government
should pay Kentucky 34,000,000 dols., the value of the slaves in that
state.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has signed the joint resolution to give England
notice of the termination of the treaty of 1817 regulating the naval
force on the lakes. The resolution is preceded by a declaration that
peace on the frontier is endangered by hostile expeditions, which the
naval forces of the two countries may be insufficient to prevent.</p>
<p>The Vice-President has officially informed the Federal Congress
that Lincoln and Johnson have been elected for four years. 213
electoral votes were cast for Lincoln and Johnson, and twenty-one for
M'Clellan and Pendleton.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Montreal Court has refused to grant further delay in the case
of the St. Albans raiders. The refusal is regarded as deciding the
case against the prisoners. Their counsel asked for delay on the
ground that the messengers sent to Richmond were unable yet to reach
their destination. It is unofficially announced that the raiders will,
if surrendered, be delivered to the authorities of Vermont for trial,
according to the State laws.</p>
<p>A mass meeting has been held at Toronto, at the call of the Mayor,
condemning the Government for passing the Alien Bill and for refunding
the money taken by the St. Albans raiders. An amendment, sustaining
the Government, was adopted by a large majority.</p></div2>

<p>....That famous Amazon of Secessia, Belle Boyd, now Mrs. Hardinge,
and whose marriage to the gallant but susceptible lieutenant whom she
converted, as Omphale converted Hercules, to Southern proclivities,
was one of the fashionable events of last season--is in London, and
proposes, it is said, to publish her memoirs as a Secesh partisan and
aide-de-camp to Stonewall Jackson. These memoirs cannot fail to be
very interesting. Belle Boyd has been the Flora Macdonald, the Madame
Lavalette, of the South, and has suffered captivity, exile, and
poverty for the cause which she believes to be the true one. It will
be gatifying to her friends to know that her husband, who was taken
prisoner while attempting to run the blockade--and who, under the
circumstances, might have expected to languish in a Federal prison
until the termination of the war--has been conditionally released, and
has rejoined his wife in England.</p>
<p>There is another American lion--for Belle Boyd deserves the nobler
gender--just now in London, and who is being lionised to the last hair
of his mane. <hi rend="italic">Il est de Marly!</hi> as they used to
say in the days of the Grand Monarque; and a grand field-day was held
in his especial honour at Aldershott last week. This lion, however,
roars from the Northern side of the hedge. His name is General Barlow,
and he is one of the youngest and bravest of the Union generals. At
the commencement of the war General Barlow was a peaceful lawyer in
New York city; but, his blood fired by the attack on Sumter, he
enlisted in the Federal army as a private; rapidly obtained promotion;
was in all the pitched battles in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania
Courthouse; captured a Confederate brigade 5000 strong; and for his
distinguished gallantry, was made a Major-General. This Paladin of the
North is a slim, beardless, well-shapen youth--just such a one as you
might picture George Brummell to have been when he was a Cornet in the
10th Hussars--and does not look six-and-twenty. But what are years to
those who are made of the heroic stuff? How old was Wellington at
Assaye, and Napoleon at Arcola?</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Zoological Society of London have
lately purchased of a London dealer in wild animals the only specimen,
it is believed, yet brought to England of the Prong-horned Antelope
(Antilope furcifer), which is commonly known in North America by the
name of the "Cabree goat." This animal is never found east of the
Mississippi, but inhabits the great western prairies of North America,
from the 53rd deg. of latitude to the plains of Mexico and California,
and was formerly numerous in the country watered by the Saskatchewan
River; frequenting the open plains and hills, but never inhabiting the
closely-wooded districts. During the winter, however, it migrates from
north to south, and returns in the warmer season. It is now becoming
scarce in most parts. Its ordinary<pb n="184"/> size, when full grown,
is about 3 ft. high and 4 ft. 4 in. long from the nose to the tip of
the tail. The body is covered with long hair, which loses its
elasticity in cold weather; there is an erect mane upon the neck; the
head, ears, and legs are clothed with short, close hair, of a common
description. The colour is generally a light fawn colour; except the
white stripes across the throat and about the legs and tail. The horns
rise perpendicularly from the skull, immediately above the eyes; they
spread outwards and are straight till within two or three inches of
the points, where they curve suddenly backwards and inwards, forming a
small hook; the prong, which is little more than an inch in length,
projects from the front of the horn, about half way up from the root;
the lower part of the horn, below the prong, is rough and of a
flattish shape; above the prong it is round, black, and polished. The
specimen now in the gardens of the society in Regent's Park is a young
male, which was brought from California to New York, and thence
re-exported to England.</p></div2>

<p>By the Inman steam-ship City of London, we have news from New York
to the 18th ult., when gold was quoted at 104&#x00BD; per cent
premium.</p>
<p>General Sherman occupied Branchville on the 8th ult. According to
the statement of a Federal courier, who was said to have left General
Sherman's army and to have ridden across the country to Smithville,
near the mouth of Cape Fear River, the occupation of Branchville was
preceded by three days' hard fighting; but the Richmond journals made
no mention of any battle, merely announcing that Branchville was
abandoned because the Federals had occupied Orangeburg, and that
General Beauregard had taken up a new line for the purpose of covering
Columbia. The latest accounts from Richmond stated that the vanguard
of General Sherman's army had reached the south bank of the Congaree
River at a point a few miles east of Columbia; that the Confederates
had fallen back to the north bank of the stream, and that a battle was
imminent. A steamer, under a flag of truce, had brought from Richmond
rumours (not very trustworthy) that General Sherman had been checked
and General Beauregard killed.</p>
<p>Nothing important had occurred in the neighbourhood of Richmond or
Petersburg. General Grant was busily engaged in fortifying his new
position at Hatcher's Run. He has extended his pickets to Shiney
Creek.</p>
<p>The Federals were continuing their operations against
Wilmington. General Terry had made three attacks on the Confederate
lines at Sugarloaf, north of Cape Fear River, all of which, though
assisted by the whole of Porter's fleet, were repulsed by the
Confederates. The result of a reconnaissance at Wilmington was, we are
told, the advance of the Federal lines three miles. The new ground was
held and works thrown up on it as strong as those to which the
Confederates had retreated. Lieutenant Cushing made another
reconnaissance to the obstructions opposite Fort Anderson, crossed the
obstructions, passed up to Wilmington, and made a complete examination
of the wharves and shipping. He also proceeded to Charlotte, North
Carolina, and destroyed all the provisions there.</p>
<p>Three thousand Federals had effected a landing at James Island,
within three miles of Charleston. The object of the movement was
unknown.</p>
<p>General Thomas had arrived in New Orleans; but it was not known how
large a part of his army he had taken with him, or whether his
operations were to be directed against Mobile or against Texas.</p>
<p>At the great war meeting held in Richmond Mr. Benjamin, the
Secretary of State, delivered a speech strongly enforcing the
necessity of employing negroes as Confederate soldiers. The Richmond
Senate, however, has taken a different view of affairs; and, while
that body has decided upon the employment of 40,000 negroes in a
menial capacity in the army, it has voted down the proposal to arm two
hundred thousand of them.</p>
<p>The plan of the new Confederate flag, submitted some time ago by
Major Rogers for the consideration of Congress, has been adopted by
the Military Committee of the House and Senate, and will henceforth be
the national emblem of the Confederate States. The change made in the
flag consists in the division of the field into a white bar and a red
bar in equal proportion, the red bar being at the outer end oF the
field.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has called an extrordinary session of the Senate
for the 4th of March, "to receive and act upon such communications as
may be made on the part of the Executive."</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden has submitted to the Committee of Ways and Means a
financial plan for the next fiscal year. It provides for the issue of
a loan of 600,000,000 dols. in such form of bonds and such rates of
interest, not exceeding 6 per cent, as may seem most advisable to the
Secretary. The total public debt on Feb. 1 is officially announced at
2,000,153,000,000 dols.; the total interest is 98,130,000 dols.</p>
<p>The Federal House of Representatives had passed a bill imposing a
duty of &#x00BD; per cent on all sales and an internal revenue tax of
eight cents per pound on cotton.</p>
<p>The Senate has refused an appropriation for the Niagara Ship
Canal.</p>
<p>Congress has passed a bill for the establishment of a mail
steam-ship line between San Francisco and China.</p>
<p>Captain Beales, concerned in the Lake Erie affair, and sentenced
to be hanged, has been respited.</p>
<p>Minnesota and Kansas have ratified the constitutional amendment,
making fifteen States who have adopted it. The majority report of the
judiciary committee of the Kentucky State Senate recommends the
rejection of the constitutional amendment. The minority report insists
on compensation as a condition to precede the ratification.</p>

<p>The following telegrams have been received through Mr. Reuter's
office:--</p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the St. David (vi&#x00E2; Greencastle) we have
received the following intelligence dated New York, Feb. 18,
Evening:--</p>
<p>General Grant reports to Mr. Stanton this evening that to-day's <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Despatch</hi> says Sherman entered and took
possession of Columbia yesterday morning. General Beauregard
communicated this intelligence officially yesterday. From his despatch
it appears that the Federals shelled Columbia on Thursday from the
south bank of the Congaree. During the night they moved up the river,
and on the following morning forded the Soluda and Broad
Rivers. During the Federal passage of these rivers, Beauregard
evacuated Columbia. The Federals soon after took possession. Two days
previously, when it was decided not to attempt the defence of
Columbia, a large quantity of medicinal stores was destroyed. The
despatch presumes that the fall of Columbia will necessitate the
evacuation of Charleston, which the despatch thinks has already
commenced.</p>
<p>The general impression is that Sherman will now proceed to
Charleston to establish his base; but the <hi
rend="italic">Despatch</hi> does not see what need he has of a
base. He subsists on the country, and his army has not been exhausted
by any battle. Since he left Savannah, Sherman declared his intention
to march to Columbia, thence to Augusta, and thence to
Charleston. This Beauregard considers was uttered as a boast to hide
his designs. The <hi rend="italic">Despatch</hi> thinks that he will
next strike at Charlotte or at Florence. It was reported yesterday
that the Federals had captured Augusta; but the <hi
rend="italic">Despatch</hi> discredits the report.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> announced a temporary
suspension on Saturday, with the view to its removal to another point,
this being rendered necessary by the progress of military events.</p>
<p>Captain Semmes has been made a Rear-Admiral, with the command of
the James River squadron. Gold, 204.</p>
<p>Philadelphia papers announce that the Richmond papers of Thursday
state that Sherman's main columns had reached Kingsville Junction,
twenty-five miles north-east of Columbia. The communication south of
the Florence Railroad and on the Charleston Railroad is
interrupted.</p>
<p>A Confederate flag-of-truce boat has been blown up on the James
River. All on board were lost.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the Tariff Bill, and
rejected the proposition to tax sales of merchandise. Mr. Stevens's
proposed tax of 10 per cent upon gold sales has been defeated.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">CANADA</hi>.--Quebec, Feb. 17.--The House in
Committee has sanctioned the appropriation of 330,000 dols. for the
expenses of the arrangements on the frontier to prevent raids. It has
also approprinted 50,000 dols. on account of the money refunded to the

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL OCCUPATION OF<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">CHARLESTON.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> evacuation of Charleston, South
Carolina, by the Confederates is one of the most startling events of a
campaign which has presented a long succession of surprises. The
fact, regarded from a military point of view, is not, perhaps, so
important as the capture of Fort Fisher; yet we can hardly wonder that
the announcement of it stirred a deeper feeling of satisfaction in the
North than any that has shown itself during the progress of the
war. The few observations we shall make on it will have reference
rather to its moral than to its military or its political
bearings. The object of the struggle at its present stage is no longer
what it was at its commencement, so far, at least, as the South is
concerned. When the first gun was fired against Fort Sumter, there can
be no doubt that the seceding States contemplated founding an
extensive and extending empire, of which<pb n="222"/> their peculiar
and, as they affirmed, necessary institution was to have been an
important element. Such an object, however, it is impossible that the
Confederacy can any longer entertain with hope. Slavery, as a social
system, has so far suffered by the collision of the two sections of
the American people that its extinction, at no very distant date, is
morally certain. Such being the case, although the issue of the
contest may involve principles to which our Transatlantic kinsmen,
whether of the North or South, attach high importance, we, as distant
spectators, seeing that the broad interests of humanity are no longer
at stake, may be excused for doubting whether the cost of further
strife will not far exceed the ends proposed to be gained by it, and
for wishing that we may soon witness the end of bloodshed and
devastation. We know not how the fall of Charleston may affect the
final balance of political power on the continent of America, nor do
we pretend to be competent to foresee its strategical effects; but
there is one point of view from which the event may be regarded which
is full of instruction and which is worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>Charleston may be said to have precipitated this war. It cannot, it
is true, be proved that but for South Carolina, of which the city of
Charleston was the heart, Mr. Lincoln's election in 1860 might not
have led to the eventual secession of the Slave States; but, at least,
it should be borne in mind that South Carolina set the example. She
did so, not by accident, but on calculation. Her temper had inclined
her in that direction for many years past. She had used her readiness
to secede as a threat on former occasions whenever her selfwill had
been crossed by President or Congress. By means of it she strove to
overbear all legitimate opposition. We neither affirm nor deny her
right as a State to take the position she did; but we note the fact
that she asserted that right with inconsiderate haste. For awhile, the
policy of which she may be said to have been not merely the advocate
but the author was accepted by the majority of the people of the
United States, and none insisted upon submission to the decisions of
that majority, when they chanced to be with her, more loudly than
South Carolina. Then came the memorable election of 1860, by which the
political supremacy of the South was, for the time being at any rate,
broken and overturned. What might have followed that popular victory
had it been accepted we can only conjecture; but the election itself
could hardly be regarded as an invasion of the sovereignty of the
Southern States. Not a single act had yet been done, not a profession
had yet been made, inimical to State rights, when South Carolina
declared for secession, and was soon followed in that course by
several of her sister States. Her precipitancy was looked upon in the
North with wonder and, for a time, with forbearance. Ordinary
patience, tact, and statesmanship on the part of Secessia might
probably then have secured her ends without the exchange of a single
shot: for there was not then such a show of angry temper in the North
as forbade the South to believe that a peaceful separation might be
practicable.</p>
<p>Things were in this critical but not altogether hopeless position
when Charleston took into her own hands to bring to an abrupt decision
the alternative of peace or war. She assailed Fort Sumter, and from
that act what a long train of miseries has proceeded! What a sea of
tears and blood has resulted from that first concussion! What an
avalanche of destruction has been brought down upon both sections of
the theretofore prosperous republic! What a huge conflagration of
passion has been kindled! For all these things South Carolina made
herself responsible. Thousands upon thousands of men and women on both
sides, who had no participation in that act, but upon whom the
terrible consequences have fallen, have since bewailed the impatience
and imperious pride that needlessly and almost gaily flung back the
floodgates of devouring war, which from that moment to this none have
been able to close, and through which an inundation of woe has swept
to cover the face of the land, with wreck and death.</p>
<p>Remembering all this, one cannot wonder that the fall of Charleston
has sent a thrill of sensation through the North, nor that the
officers of the Federal Government took possession of the already
ruined city with a feeling of satisfaction that poetic justice had at
length overtaken her. We cannot pretend to be conscious of that
feeling. We know too well how, in all such calamities, the innocent
suffer with the guilty; and how, not the perpetrators of the crime
alone, but also those who would have prevented it if they could, share
the doom which it has entailed. But we do see in the retribution which
has befallen Charleston enough to make us pause and ponder. It does
present to our minds some suggestions, wholly uncoloured by party
feeling, to which we think attention may be profitably given.</p>
<p>The old proverb says, "Curses, like chickens, come home to roost."
The experience of mankind, condensed into these few words, discloses
to us one of the laws which characterise the moral government of the
world. Those who rely on the power of cursing--or, otherwise
expressed, on words of menace, outbursts of passion, and impatient and
angry self-assertion--rely upon the reed which, when it breaks,
pierces the hands of such as lean upon it. South Carolina, on any
question into which her passions entered, disdained reasoning. An
overbearing reiteration of her will was her main argument. Her social
structure had nurtured in her habits of despotic command, and she
freely expressed them. It will not do. It never has done. It is as
certain of bringing round its own retribution as it is that what men
sow they will reap. The fate of Charleston, now desolate and in ruins,
is but another historical illustration, added to many foregoing ones,
that reason, law, and justice cannot be set at defiance, by however
strong a will, with ultimate impunity.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note, moreover, that to Charleston has been denied
the gratification of falling heroically. Her children were quite as
brave as others; but circumstances conspired to render her fate an
inglorious one. She who fired the first gun in this awful war was
finally taken possession of in a manner humiliating to her pride. No
one will forget her successful defence of herself at an earlier
period; yet no one will associate with her end a sentiment of
enthusiastic admiration. Almost before Europe has given a week's
reflection to the announcement of her having been abandoned, the fact
is almost lost sight of, having been obliterated by the later tidings
that South Carolina is being traversed by an army of her foe, not
merely unresisted, but seemingly unmenaced, by her inhabitants.</p>
<p>Yet, one can hardly doubt that Charleston, prostrate as she is,
will rise up, and enter upon a better future. Her geographical
position will ever make her the chief maritime outlet for the
productions of the South. Cotton and tobacco will still be grown when
slavery has ceased. She has paid the penalty of her own mistake. Her
ruins will be repaired. Her grass-grown streets will once again
resound with traffic. Her waters will be crowded with the ships of all
nations. And her last state of prosperity will, we devoutly trust,
bury her first in forgetfulness.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 22nd ult,, at which time gold was
quoted at 201&#x00BD;.</p>
<p>Charleston, the capital of South Carolina, has been surrendered. We
were able to announce this fact in a portion of our Impression last
week. This city, the most important, next to New Orleans, of the
Southern seaports, where the first shot of the war was fired, and
which for nearly four years set at defiance the whole power of the
Northern navy, assisted by a considerable land force, is now
garrisoned by Federal troops. Charleston was evacuated by the
Confederates on the night of the 17th and occupied by the Federals on
the morning of the 18th ult.</p>
<p>In April 1861, Fort Sumter, at that time occupied by a Federal
garrison, was besieged by the people of Charleston, and surrendered
after a bombardment of some hours, but which occasioned no loss of
life. From that time till the 18th of February, 1865, the flag of the
United States never waved either on the forts or in the town. Animated
in part by feelings of vengeance and partly by a desire to gain one of
the principal Confederate seaport towns, the North spared no efforts
to gain possession of Charleston. Expedition after expedition was
dispatched with this object, ironclads were built expressly to run the
gauntlet of the fire from the forts by which the entrance to the
harbour was protected, and even cannon were invented and new engines
of destruction designed for the special purpose of raining fire on the
city which had so provoked the Federal wrath. But ironclads, Parrott
guns, and Greek fire were alike useless. When the city was evacuated
the Federal fleet was beyond the range of Fort Sumter, and the
besieging army was peaceably encamped behind its
intrenchments. Charleston was abandoned because the successes of a
General who had never appeared before its walls rendered the step
necessary, and the ironclads entered its harbour and General Gilmore's
forces occupied its streets without firing or receiving a shot.</p>
<p>On the 15th ult. Sherman appeared before Columbia, and, having
bombarded the town from the south side of the river on which it
stands, it was surrendered without a struggle. On the following day
the outposts of the Federal army reached the Kingsville Junction,
twenty miles north-east of Columbia, and thus secured possession of
the railroads communicating with the eastern portions of South
Carolina.</p>
<p>Intelligence of these events having been transmitted to Charleston,
the evacuation of that town was effected on the night of the 17th
ult., and on the following morning the Federal troops entered, without
opposition. The guns, to the number of two hundred, with which the
fortifications were armed, fell into the hands of the Federals, after,
however, having been spiked, and a considerable quantity of ammunition
also became prize of war. The retreating Confederates, however, left
as little for the enemy as they could possibly help. They set fire to
the arsenals, quartermaster's stores, and cotton d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;ts,
blew up their ironclads and other vessels in the dockyards, and
destroyed the railway bridges leading from the town. The upper portion
of the city was also intentionally, or accidentally, set in flames,
and 6000 bales of cotton are supposed to have been burnt. The
Confederate forces had quitted the city before the besiegers entered,
and no attempt was made to molest them in their retreat. The motives
which led to the abandonment of Charleston are manifest. Cut off from
the rest of the Confederacy, its capture became inevitable, and its
abandonment furnished the only way by which the army to which its
defence was intrusted could be saved from destruction. The
Confederates, after leaving the place, retreated in a north-westerly
direction.</p>
<p>Meantime Sherman was pushing his advantage in the centre of<pb
n="223"/> South Carolina. Beauregard, on leaving Columbia, retreated
rapidly towards Charlotte, a railway centre in North Carolina, about
eighty-five miles nearly due north of Columbia. Sherman's column lost
no time in following the Confederates up, and at last accounts was
thirty miles north of Columbia.</p>
<p>At Wilmington, too, the Federals have been successful. On the 10th
of February General Schofield, assisted by Admiral Porter, assaulted
and carried Fort Anderson, the garrison making good their retreat. The
fall of Wilmington, we are told, appeared certain.</p>
<p>From Newbern and various other points strong forces have started to
operate on the railways, and in Western Virginia another raid was
preparing. In Alabama General Thomas was, it is said, making
arrangements to prevent Hood's army from going to the Carolinas. Some
10,000 men have, however, left to reinforce Beauregard.</p>
<p>No active movements had taken place before Petersburg, but a strong
impression prevailed that Lee would evacuate that place and fall back
to Lynchburg, where he would be joined by Beauregard and such other
Confederate forces as could make their way to him.</p>

<p>The Upper House of the Canadian Parliament has voted, by forty-five
to fifteen, in favour of the confederation scheme. An address will be
presented to the Queen based upon the resolutions of the
Conference.</p>
<p>The Legislative Assembly, while in Committee of Supply, voted,
without a division, 50,000 dols. for the purpose of reimbursing the
St. Albans banks for the losses they sustained by the Confederate
raiders.</p></div2>

able. "Virginia, First and Last," is no doubt by Mr. Conway, whose
able contributions to this magazine we have before had occasion to
notice. The writer's situation is peculiar, he being, at the same
time, a patriotic Virginian and one of the most determined opponents
of slavery, in America or out of it. His love for his native State is
pathetically evident in his description of Virginian homes in the good
old times, while he does not disguise the deterioration which has
followed the unhappy day when, some thirty years since, Virginia
definitively united her fortunes with the Slaveholding States, and
excluded the liberal and humanising culture of New England. According
to Mr. Conway, the actuating principle of Virginia and the Carolinas
is the assertion of State rights, and consequent dissolution of a
Union which has become incompatible with them, while the rest of the
revolted States regard the destruction of the Union as a means to an
end, and that end the propagation of slavery. He seems to foreshadow a
breach between the allies on this account....</p></div2>

<p>Our latest news from New York, by the Nova Scotian, is to the
morning of the 5th inst.</p>
<p>In President Lincoln's Inaugural Address, which we give on another
column, there is, it will be seen, no indication of any change of
policy.</p>
<p>The great blockade-running city of Wilmington, as stated to a
considerable portion of our Impression last week, passed into Federal
occupation on the 22nd ult., Washington's birthday. From Admiral
Porter's official despatches we learn that General Schofield, now in
command of the Federal military in that quarter, advanced, on the 17th
ult., from Smithville, four vessels of the fleet simultaneously
attacking and enfilading the works. The wind and tide prevented more
vessels from participating in the engagement. Fort Anderson answered
pretty briskly, but quieted down by sunset. During the night the
Confederates sent 200 floating torpedoes down the river, but Porter
sunk them by musketry. One torpedo entered and blew up the wheel-house
of the Osceola, and knocked down the bulkheads. No damage however, was
done to the hull. Porter spread fishing-nets across the river. Next
morning Porter advanced with the greater part of the fleet. A heavy
fire was maintained silencing the Confederate batteries by three
p.m. Porter, however, continued the fire until dark, and also through
the night, and in the mean time Schofield was working in the
rear. "While the fleet maintained a heavy fire upon the fort,"
Schofield says, "I pressed the enemy on both sides of the river, and
sent Cox sixteen miles round the swamp to the enemy's right. Cox
proceeded along the narrow defile between the two swamps, and
completely turned the enemy's position. The enemy, discovering the
movement, abandoned the works and retreated to Wilmington. The guns
captured are uninjured. Fifty prisoners were taken. The loss was
small, on each side." It is stated that the Confederate shot made no
impression on the Federal monitors, although but a third of a mile
from the fort. The southern face of the fort, however, was "badly
disfigured." The Federals sent a sham monitor, constructed of canvas,
up the river with the tide to explode torpedoes. It floated past the
fort, and is supposed to have hastened its evacuation, the
Confederates believing the water communication gone. Immediately upon
the evacuation of Fort Anderson, Schofield directed Cox, one of his
subordinates, to follow the garrison towards Wilmington. The
Confederates made a stand behind Town Creek; but on the 20th Cox
crossed the river below them on flat boats, attacked their rear, and
routed them, taking two guns and 300 prisoners. On the 21st Cox pushed
on to Brunswick River, opposite Wilmington, where the bridges were on
fire on his arrival. The Southerners had begun burning cotton and
resin in the city, and left it that night. Citizens state that 1000
bales of cotton and 15,000 barrels of resin were burned. Northern
accounts say that "Union feeling showed itself strongly in the
city."</p>
<p>Sherman has burnt Columbia--in retaliation, it is said, for his
troops having been fired upon after they entered the city. The
Southern papers charge the Federal General with having bombarded the
town without giving warning of his intention to do so. Such accounts
as we have of General Sherman's movements are obscure and
contradictory. On the one hand, it appears to have been reported in
New York that General Sherman had marched in an easterly direction,
and had effected a junction with General Schofield, on the 27th ult.,
at some place not named. On the other hand, it seems to have been
stated by the Richmond newspapers that General Sherman was moving
against Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina, and had left the
Confederate army, under its new Commander-in-Chief, General Joseph
Johnston (who has superseded Beauregard), in his rear, at
Charlotte. There are rumours by the last mail of a battle, and of
Sherman and Schofield having been checked.</p>
<p>Southern papers continue to speak confidently of the safety of
Richmond and of Lee's ability to withstand any movement made by
Grant. On the other hand, there are statements that preparations for
the evacuation of the place have begun. It is said that Grant was
preparing for a new movement, but that the weather interfered with his
plans. General Grant states that since May last 17,000 deserters have
come over to him from the Confederate army. According to the Richmond
papers Grant's troops north of the James River have been moved to the
left and massed with the rest of his army in the vicinity of Hatcher's
Run.</p>
<p>The proposition to arm 200,000 negroes passed the Confederate House
of Representatives on the 20th ult.; but it was indefinitely postponed
by the Senate on the following day, by a majority of one. The <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Dispatch</hi> thinks the bill will be
reconsidered and passed. Opinion at the South seems evenly balanced on
the subject. General Lee has expressed his opinion that the employment
of slaves in the army is both expedient and necessary, on the ground
that the white population alone cannot supply the necessities of a
long war; and recommends that a call for those who will volunteer upon
the condition of their freedom be immediately authorised by the
Southern Congress. The message of the Governor of Georgia opposes the
arming of the slaves. They do not wish to enter the army. They will
desert by thousands. The Governor, it is said, denounces violently the
military and civil policy of President Davis, which, if persisted in,
he says, must terminate in reconstruction, with or without
subjugation.</p>
<p>A bill has passed the Confederate House of Representatives, in
secret Session, anthorising the arming of negroes tendered by owners,
and also authorising the President to call upon each State, whenever
expedient, for a quota of 300,000 troops, irrespective of colour, in
addition to those subject to military service under existing laws. The
relations of slaves and masters remain unchanged, except by consent of
the owners in States where slaves reside.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress have expelled Senator Foote.</p>
<p>The Virginia Senate has authorised the Governor to call for
volunteers among the slaves and free negroes of the State for the
defence of Richmond and other points threatened. They are to be
organised into infantry companies for the year's service, under white
officers, and to be placed at the disposal of the
General-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Governor Vance, in a proclamation to the people of North Carolina,
declares that the only dangers that threaten the cause of Southern
independence are the depression consequent upon recent reverses and
the risk of internal dissension. The muster-rolls of the Confederacy
show the record of 400,000 soldiers, but thousands upon thousands of
them are absent without leave. To entreat, to put to shame, or to
drive these men back to the defence of their country's standard is the
business of the hour.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has approved the Fortifications Bill, the
appropriations for which have been reduced to half their original
amount.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the 600,000,000 dols. Loan
Bill.</p>
<p>The Senate has adopted the amendment increasing the duty on
tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cheroots. It has also passed the House
Bill taxing sales &#x00BD; per cent.</p>
<p>New Jersey had refused to ratify the constitutional amendment.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from Quebec to Feb. 24.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council have got rapidly through with the debate on
the confederation scheme, having closed the discussion of that measure
on Monday, Feb. 20, when the motion in favour thereof was carried by a
vote of 45 to 15.</p>
<p>The discussion of the proposed new Constitution continues nightly
in the Lower House.</p>
<p>The resumption of the trial of the St. Albans raiders took place in
Montreal on Monday, Feb. 20, when the court was thronged with
spectators. Mr. Kerr opened the argument for the defence, and was
followed by Mr. Laflamme on the same side. On Tuesday the latter
counsel was to continue his arguments against the extradition of the
prisoners, but, owing to the indisposition of Judge Smith, the Court
did not sit on that day. The investigation is creating vast
excitement. Mr. Kerr submitted to the Court a series of printed
propositions, seventeen in number, with authorities sustaining
them.</p>
<p>Mr. F. W. Torrance, barrister, of Montreal, has opened his
commission of inquiry into the conduct of Judge Coursol in dismissing
the St. Albans raiders. Mr. Henry Stuart, Q.C., applied to be
admitted to watch the case for his client, which the Commissioner
declined to allow. The Hon. Mr. Letellier brought the matter before
the notice of the Upper Chamber by inquiring of the Government whether
it was by their instructions that the Commissioner was proceeding <hi
rend="italic">ex parte</hi> and with closed doors. In reply. Sir
E. P. Tach&#x00E9; stated that Mr. Torrance was only acting in virtue
of his commission, that he had received no instructions, and was
carrying on the inquiry according to law.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS.</p>
<p>The following is the full text of President Lincoln's inaugural
address, received on Thursday night through Mr. Reuter's office:--</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fellow-Countrymen</hi>.--At this second
appearance to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less
occasion for an extended address than at the first. Then, a statement,
somewhat in detail, of the course to be pursued seemed very fitting
and proper; now, at the expiration of four years, during which public
declarations have constantly been called forth concerning every point
and phase of the great contest which still absorbs attention and
engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be
presented.</p>
<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is
as well known to the public as to myself. It is, I trust, reasonably
satisfactory and encouraging to all with a high hope for the
future. No prediction in that regard is ventured. On the occasion
corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously
directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it; all sought to
avoid it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this
place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, the
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war,
seeking to dissolve the union and divide the effects, by
negotiating. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make
war rather than let the Union perish; and war came. One eighth of the
whole population were coloured slaves; not distributed generally over
the Union, but located in the Southern part. These slaves constituted
a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew the interest would,
somehow, cause war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this
interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union
by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than restrict
the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected the
magnitude or duration which it has already attained; neither
anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease even before the
conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph and a
result less fundamental and astonishing. Both read the same Bible and
pray to the same God. Each invokes His aid against the other. It may
seem strange that any man should dare to ask a just God's assistance
in wringing bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us
judge not, that we be not judged. The prayer of both should not be
answered; and neither has been answered fully, for the Almighty has
his own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offences, for it must
needs be that offence come, but woe unto that man by whom the offence
cometh!" If we suppose American slavery one of these offences which in
the providence of God must needs come, but which, having continued
through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives
to both North and South this terrible war, as due to them by whom the
offence came, shall we discern that there is any departure from those
Divine attributes which believers in the living God always ascribe to
Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently, do we pray, that this mighty
scourge of war may speedily pass away; yet if it be God's will that it
continue until the wealth piled by bondsmen by 250 years' unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash
shall be paid by another drawn by the sword, as was said 3000 years
ago, so still it must be said that the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous. With malice towards none, with charity for all, with
firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive
on to finish the work we are engaged in; to bind up the nation's
wounds; to care for the man who shall have borne the battle, and for
the widow and orphans; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just
and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> most interesting, as well as the most
important, debate which has marked the present Session took place on
Monday last, when Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald, calling attention to the
report of Colonel Jervois on the defences of Canada, brought up "the
American question." Several of the best speakers in the house took
part in the discussion, and the Commons were occupied upon it until
near midnight, the Premier closing the debate. It was, generally
speaking, conducted in a manner which showed that the House had a due
sense of the weight which would attach to the deliberate utterances of
the British House of Representatives. The report is now on its way to
the West, and it will be interesting to know how it will have affected
American readers. The declaration of the friends of the Federals that
the newspapers of the States are not to be respected, as they do not
represent the feeling of the people, may as well be borne in mind when
we are told, as we unquestionably shall be, that the British are
showing their terror of the great and glorious armies which the
crushing of the rebellion will liberate, and probably dispatch to
rectify an account which requires stern overhauling.</p>
<p>We do not suppose that an honest American reader of the debate,
however much he may fancy he dislikes England, will perceive any signs
of terror in the great debate, We are expressly told, on both sides of
the House, that there is no reason to believe that the Federals
propose to break the peace. Lord Palmerston assures us of the friendly
character of the relations between the Government at Washington and
our own; but his words are those which a Minister is bound to use
until a rupture takes place, and too nearly resemble the assurances of
peace which we received within a very short time of the declaration of
war with Russia, to derive very great importance from the position of
the speaker. Mr. Disraeli, like the celebrated German who had never
seen a camel but nevertheless described one, evolved a Federal out of
his own moral consciousness, and, having constructed the being, cited
Aristotle to show that Lincoln would not invade Canada. The leader of
the Opposition assumed, and sustained with great skill, a calm,
philosophic tone in regard to America; and argued, from a lofty
height, and as if with a bird's-eye view of affairs, that we need not
apprehend war, though it was just and necessary to state that our
Government was not to be thanked for our security. But Mr. Bright, who
may be regarded as the member for Federalia, and who represents
American views far more faithfully than those of any large number of
Englishmen, would not be content with any formalism or any
philosophy. He was, or seemed to be, more angry than he usually
appears and, while peace was his theme, he thundered over it as if he
were proclaiming war. Mr. Bright contended that England had behaved
ill to the Federals in recognising the South, in taking a high tone in
the Trent affair, and in permitting the Alabama and other
English-built vessels to ravage the seas. That was the guilt of the
Government. The educated classes had behaved ill in admiring the
valour of the slaveowners and in rejoicing at their successful
resistance. The press had behaved ill in recording its belief that the
Confederates would make a long defence, and might ultimately establish
their independence, and, moreover, in describing the victories which
they had gained. Lord Russell was let off easily, though his
declaration that the triumph of the North would be good neither for
the negroes nor for humanity is on permanent record. Mr. Bright--and
we have noted his words at some length because he is the American
advocate--is instructed to say that there is "no fear of war."</p>
<p>These were the statements of the three men who represent opposed
opinions, and, for different reasons, they all agree that at present
there is no cause to apprehend a rupture. The allegation by Mr. Seward
that at the Hampton Roads conference the Confederates proposed to make
peace, and then that North and South should fall on Canada, is eagerly
repudiated by the Richmond press, and we are assured that it was not
upon Canada, but upon Mexico, that it was proposed to fall, and that
the French, not the English, were to be expelled from the New
World. This may or may not be. If we have to express our opinion, it
would be that, had the North seen its way to any war at all, the South
would not have been particular as to the direction in which the
reunited stars should travel; nor have we done anything to deserve the
affection of the South. The Emperor of the French will, doubtless,
take into consideration the amiable readiness of the Confederates to
overturn the new Mexican Empire. He is, in fact, in much the same
position as ourselves in regard to America. If Canada be attacked, we
shall certainly support her with the whole force which Great Britain
can bring to bear; and if the Canadian frontier be indefensible, that
is also the case with several points in another frontier, which it is
not necessary to name. If Mexico be attacked, the honour of France is
pledged to maintain, for some years at least, the empire which she has
founded, and which will be an invaluable boon to a country which was
never free, by reason of the numerous bloodthirsty and corrupt
tyrannies which rendered Mexico a by-word among nations. The American
reader of our debates will perceive that our statesmen of all parties
are fully aware of all the bearings of the case, and we think that the
speeches of the responsible orators will show that "rowdy rhetoric"
has produced no effect upon the tempers of Englishmen, and that we do
not accept the scoffs of vulgar writers as the expression of American
opinion. And, above all, and amid all, and beneath all will be found,
we hope, the resistless current of a noble faith--namely, the belief
that Providence will not permit the despots of the world to enjoy the
humiliating spectacle of the two great free nations of the earth, the
mighty champions of civilisation and progress, engaged in hideous
grapple, instead of leading in majestic union the march of mankind
towards better things than can be gained by war.</p></div2>

<p>....It was not to be taken as a necessity that a great debate on
the policy of this country towards the United States was involved in
Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald's motion on the defences of Canada. It would
have been quite possible to keep the discussion within the narrow
circle of military administration; but it would seem that this
opportunity was skilfully employed to promulgate opinions and indicate
a policy on the part of the leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons, and to neutralise the bounceability of the chief of the
Opposition in the House of Lords in reference to Anglo-American
affairs. With considerable dexterity Mr. Fitzgerald contrived to
impeach the Government for not preparing to defend Canada to the
uttermost, and at the same time to insinuate a belief in the best and
most peaceful intentions on the part of the United States, a feeling
which, if he happened to get into the Foreign Office, was to be
cherished and, if possible, expanded....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Monday.</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Defences Of Canada.--Our
Relations With America.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Seymour Fitzgerald</hi> brought under
notice the report of Colonel Jervois with reference to the defences of
Canada, and called attention generally to the state of that colony in
the event of an attack by the Federal States of America. The
hon. gentleman observed that in his opinion the Federal Government
were quite justified in giving notice of their intention to terminate
the mutual arrangement with regard to the naval strength of both
Powers on the lakes; but that he thought we ought to have met the
Government of Washington and to have proposed a temporary increase of
the naval police. Had this been done the Federal Government would, in
all probability, never have given us notice of the termination of the
convention. Again, with regard to the notice to put an end to the
Reciprocity Treaty, that notice might have been given in a moment of
irritation, and he could not but think that if we had said to
Mr. Seward, "Do not precipitately put an end to a treaty which has
hitherto worked so well; but point out to us how we can meet your
views and we will endeavour to modify the treaty with that end,"
matters might have been arranged satisfactorily. Looking at the
experience of the past, as exhibited in the Trent affair, he thought
it would be idle of us to shut our eyes to the imminence of a quarrel,
at no remote period, with the Federal States. He believed that if
Canada were independent she would have nothing to fear from the
Northern States. But she was not independent, and, so long as she
desired to maintain her connection with the mother country, we were
bound in honour to stand by her. Under these circumstances, he warned
the Government to take active steps to counteract the efforts which
the Northern States were now making for the contingency of war with
England. What, he asked, were we doing for the defence of Quebec, and
for placing gun-boats on the internal waters of America. He considered
that we were bound at once to communicate with the Canadian
Government, with a view to putting the colony in a defensive
state. This would strengthen the prospects of peace; and if,
unhappily, war should break out, we would have the satisfaction of
knowing that we had done our best towards maintaining the honour of
England untarnished. Prompt and vigorous action was absolutely
necessary, and he hoped that the Government would not hesitate a
moment in taking it.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">W. E. Forster</hi> expressed a hope that
the Government would give a full and frank reply with reference not
only to the relations between Canada and the United States, but also
with respect to ourselves and the Government of Washington. He
admitted that there was apprehension out of doors with reference to
our future relations with America, but, in his opinion, they were
absolutely groundless. In support of this argument he reminded the
House of the absurd panic of a French invasion which had disturbed the
propriety of the country a few years since, and which we were all now
thoroughly ashamed of. He denied that either the American Government
or the American people were anxious for war with England; and he
maintained that the proper way to defend Canada was, not by
fortifications or gun-boats, but by persistence in a dignified policy
of neutrality.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardwell</hi> expressed the gratification
with which he was able to make the announcement that our relations
with the United States were perfectly friendly. With equal confidence
and pleasure he was enabled to state that there were no papers in the
possession of her Majesty's Government varying the principle upon
which the question of the Alabama stood between the two
Governments. With regard to the Convention limiting the naval force to
be kept on the lakes, Earl Russell had communicated with the United
States Minister his desire to substitute another agreement for the old
one; and, so soon as the notice to terminate the Reciprocity Treaty
had been given, no time would be lost by Government in endeavouring to
open negotiations on a subject of such vital importance. The right
hon. gentleman also explained in detail the steps which her Majesty's
Government, in conjunction with the colonial Government, intended to
take for the strategic defence of the provinces.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> did not wish to pass any
opinion on the probable termination of the civil war in America, but
he had no hesitation in saying that we were bound to put our Canadian
possessions in a state of proper defence. No one wanted the mother
country to defend an extended seaboard, but what the country expected
was that her Majesty's troops in Canada should not be placed in such a
position that their admitted bravery and skill would be of no
avail.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lowe</hi> asked the House to consider what
this country was bound to do for the defence of Canada. It was, he
thought, absurd to attempt to defend a seaboard of 1500 miles. In his
opinion, the better course would be to withdraw our troops from
Canada, and, in case of war with the United States, to concentrate our
force upon some vulnerable point of the Union.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">J. Fergusson</hi> complained that the
Government were not doing that which they themselves admitted to be
necessary for the defence of Canada. It was, he thought, a mere
mockery to speak of expending &#x00A3;50,000 a year for such a
purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi> underrated the value of the
North American provinces to the Crown, and asked whether the country
was prepared to pay an income tax of a shilling in the pound for the
purpose of defending Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Fortesque</hi> observed that the
Government considered it to be a matter of duty to defend our North
American provinces, provided they wished to remain dependent on the
British Crown and were prepared to play a manly part in their own
defence. He did not believe that the American peaple would be insane
and foolish enough to turn their arms against a friendly power by
attacking Canada.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> was of opinion that a
statement of the entire cost of the scheme of Canadian defence should
be laid before Parliament. He confessed he could not see any
reasonable prospect of supplying Canada with suitable ordnance for
many years to come.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Watkin</hi> contended that her Majesty's
Government should state distinctly to that of the United States that
they looked upon Canada as a part of the British empire, and that they
were prepared to defend it at all cost. In that case there would be no
war with America.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Farquhar</hi> urged that, in
consideration of the loyal feeling of the Canadians towards the mother
country and the extent of our commercial interests in Canada, it was
the duty of this country to put forth all her power in the defence of
that colony.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Elcho</hi> concurred in the common-sense
view taken by Mr. Lowe, and said that it would be most impolitic to
attempt the defence of Canada by means of a British army. If war
should break out, he would recommend striking at some vital part of
the enemy. He regarded the proposals of the Government as powerless
for defence, though strong to invite aggression.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ayrton</hi> said the best way to defend
and preserve Canada would be to maintain amicable relations with the
United States. If, however, any dispute should arise between the two
countries the better course would be to submit the matter to
arbitration.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Cecil</hi> deprecated discussions of
this irritating description, and maintained that for the honour of
England it was necessary that whatever was to be done for Canada
should be done quickly and completely.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright</hi> commented upon the
circumstance that a bitter feeling had grown up of late in reference
to the Federal States, and inquired how there was to be war if England
was not in favour of it and the United States were opposed to it. He
did not believe that any cause of hostility would arise out of the
recent affairs in Canada, but that, if the peace were broken, it would
be in consequence of some misunderstanding between the Government at
Washington and that at London. The hon. member proceeded to comment
upon the panic which now prevailed on the subject of America, and said
that, although "the City" appeared to be frightened, there was really
nothing to cause apprehension, and that "the City" was very seldom
right, because speculators were rarely able to form a cool and
dispassionate opinion upon any subject in which their financial
interests were concerned.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> denied that any feeling
of jealousy existed in this country against the United States; on the
contrary, he believed that there was no Englishman who did not survey
with pride the great Anglo-Saxon race which was rising on the other
side of the Atlantic. Feelings of irritation no doubt prevailed
against England in America--among the Northerners and the
Southerners--because we had refused to join the one or recognise the
other; but this feeling would wear away in time, and he was persuaded
that nothing would be done by England to provoke hostilities with
America. He did not agree with Mr. Lowe, that Canada could not be
defended. There was no intention to withdraw her Majesty's troops from
Canada, and he thought that, so long as the Canadians were prepared to
throw in their lot with us, we were bound in honour to do the utmost
we could for them. Her Majesty's Government had no cause of complaint
against America. There were, it was true, international claims arising
out of the war, but there was no reason to suppose that they could not
be adjusted without difficulty.</p>
<p>The subject then dropped.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Bombardment Of Fort
Fisher.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Engraving on page 249 is from a
sketch by our Special Artist, representing the scene within the
north-eastern salient of Fort Fisher, near Wilmington, during the
second great bombardment, which was commenced on the 18th of January,
and continued till the successful assault in the afternoon of the
15th. A part of the Federal fleet is seen lying at anchor towards the
right-hand side of this view; while the storming-party, which numbered
2500 men, is landing in the distance and preparing to extend itself
across the neck of land between the sea and the Cape Fear River. The
guns in battery, shown in the right-hand corner of the foreground, are
still being worked against that part of the Federal fleet which lies
farther to the right, and which cannot, therefore, be included in this
view. Most of the other guns in the fort have been disabled by the
heavy shot of the enemy; and the exposed position of the men, with
shells of the largest size falling and exploding in the midst of them,
is terribly apparent in our Illustration.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Camp Of Confederate
Prisoners At Elmira.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal Government has, since last July, confined a large
number of its prisoners of war in an encampment formed at Elmira, in
the State of New York, distant 277 miles from New York city, on the
Erie Railroad. We have been favoured by Mr. Horace Ruxton with a view
of this encampment, taken from the "Observatory" lately built upon the
public road outside the camp, which is daily visited by a multitude of
curious persons, who pay the proprietor of the Observatory at the rate
of ten cents a head for permission to have a peep at the formidable
captives. The inclosure within which these prisoners are confined is a
space of some twenty acres of ground, with a broad river running in
the rear, and high walls on every side. Here about 10,000 of the
Confederate soldiers who have been made prisoners of war are kept in
safe custody, lodging in the wooden huts or in the canvas tents shown
in our Engraving. Sentries are posted all round on the walls in such a
position that they can have a clear view of everything within the
camp, while the movements of the sentries themselves cannot be watched
by the prisoners. At night the whole place is lighted up with
kerosene-oil lamps. A number of spies are employed to mix with the
prisoners and inform the Commandant of any plots which they may form
to escape. Notwithstanding these precautions, an attempt was made, at
the end of November, by about 300 of them, to dig a trench
underground, from one of the hospitals to the wall, intending to pass
under the wall and get out beyond. This scheme was, however, detected,
and their escape prevented, on the night which they had
fixed. Mr. Buxton assures us that the prisoners at Elmira are well fed
and clothed, and there is an excellent medical staff to attend to the
sick. They amuse themselves with reading and writing, or making toys
and other small articles for sale.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Federal Prison In Fort
Lafayette.</hi></p>
<p>An Englishman who has been connected with the Southern American
Confederacy, and is necessarily an active partisan, having lately
undergone a detention in one of the Federal prisons--Fort
Lafayette--sends us sketches of which we engrave two; and a letter,
from which we extract the following description:--"I send you three
sketches taken during a short imprisonment in Fort Lafayette--two
interior views of Casemate No. 2, and a view of the inside of the
fort. I may observe that, apart from their giving a true picture of
life in the Federal prison, seldom has artist or amateur put pencil to
paper with so little in his stomach as was contained in mine during
the few hours occupied upon these sketches; for during the brief
period of this self-allotted task I was invited to solve the
interesting problem of finding upon how very little 'bad bread,
salt-horse, and bean-soup' (all but the bean) a full-grown man can
continue the somewhat necessary operation of breathing. The rule as to
the issue of rations in this Northern prison, both in quality and
quantity, is unchangeable and really monotonous in its effect, A word
or two about this now celebrated prison may be interesting to your
readers. Like old Sumter, it is a sea-girt fortress, standing at the
entrance of New York Harbour, and, bristling with 100-pounders, is
ready, with its sister forts Hamilton and Richmond, on Long Island and
Staten Island respectively, to dispute the passage of the Narrows with
any Confederate or other gun-boats attempting to force a passage. As
soon as the war commenced, the Federal Government recognised the
adaptability of this fort as a military prison; and from that time to
the present its gun-rooms and casemates have been crowded with
Confederate prisoners of all ranks and grades. It was here that the
members of the Maryland Legislature were placed in durance vile, and
here it was that en-Governor Morehead of Kentucky, lingered till he
was brought to the verge of death. The Hon. Pierre Soul&#x00E9;, too,
and a host of other Confederate notables have been confined here; and
here, when I had the good fortune to obtain my order of release the
other day, I left many still in prison, amongst whom were Admiral
Buchanan, General Page and his Staff (captured in Mobile Bay and at
fort Morgan), Generals Pryor and Beal, Captain Thom and other
officers, besides a large number of privates and a few
blockade-runners. Among them was one Captain Beall, a Virginian, an
officer in the Confederate army and holding also a naval commission,
who was confined in the same casemate (No. 2) in which I was. He was
charged with piracy on Lake Erie, and was kept in irons and forbidden
to leave the casemate. With respect to the rules and regulations of
this fort, and the system of feeding the prisoners I have no words at
my disposal sufficient to express my indignation; but I must say, in
justice to the Yankee officers quartered there during my imprisonment,
that from one and all--including even 'Old Burke,' the Commandant,
himself--I received every courtesy; and this was not because I was a
Britisher, for the disease of Anglophobia had assumed an epidemic form
in the North. No discretion is allowed to these officers; they have
but to carry out the orders received from Washington, and it is in
their power to make themselves very obnoxious to those under their
charge. But the explanation of their good conduct in this case is, I
believe, that they were officers of the regular army of the United
States, and not of the volunteer service; their regiment was the 10th
Infantry. I conclude with my earnest prayer for a speedy exchange of
prisoners."</p>
<p>With respect to Captain Beall, who is mentioned by the writer of
the above letter as one of his fellow-prisoners, it appears from the
New York papers of the 25th that he was put to death on Governor's
Island the previous day. He behaved with much fortitude, and protested
against the execution of his sentence, declaring that what he had done
was in the service of his country.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Artemus Ward His Book</hi>. (John Camden Hotten.)
The grimness of American humour is conspicuous in the remark
attributed to President Lincoln when, not long after his election, he
was afflicted with smallpox or some similar disease; "now," said he,
stretching out his huge hand, with a sardonic smile, "I shall be able
to give everybody something." American humour, moreover, is
remarkable for breadth, for exaggeration, for vulgarity, and for
profanity. The last characteristic is traced by Mr. Hotten, in the
preface to "Artemus Ward," to a very probable origin. He considers it
to have resulted from the practice in which the Puritans indulged of
mingling the sacred with the secular, the words of Scripture with the
customs of common life. This comic profanity has spread (not in
America only) from the pulpit to the exhibition-hall, the
lecture-room, and the "funny" periodical. American humour, in the
written or printed form, is further intensified (or not, as you
please) by misspelling and by the substitution of numerals for certain
words. This trick, whereby a quaint effect is gained, is not
unfamiliar to Englishmen, but with Americans it seems to be
indispensable. Fair samples of American humour of all kinds are to be
found in "Artemus Ward." "Artemus Ward" is, of course, a mere writing
name, but he who has adopted it is a type of a large class of
Americans, and his biography, sketched in Mr. Hotten's preface, gives
a graphic picture of the methods adopted by versatile Americans to
secure the "almighty dollar." "Artemus" writes his "book" in the
character of a wax-showman, and a few specimens of his style will
probably be found amusing. On a certain occasion, during his travels
with his show, he "got swampt in the exterior of New York State, one
dark and stormy night," when he observed in the distance "the gleams
of a taller candle." Thereupon he says, "tiein a hornet's nest to my
off hoss's tail, to kinder encourage him, I soon reached the place."
The place turns out to be a settlement of Shakers, "the strangest
religious sex," remarks Artenius, "I ever met." The Shakers appear to
dress oddly, if Artemus has any ground for saying "a solum female,
lookin somewhat like a last year's bean-pole stuck into a long
meal-bag, cum in and axed me was I athurst, and did I hunger," and for
addressing Elder Uriah in the words, "If I may be so bold, kind Sir,
what's the price of that pecooler kind of weskit you wear, incloodin
trimmins?" The "religious exercises" are thus spoken of:--"The
Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was to have sarvices
that mornin; so I put on a clean biled rag and went. The meetin house
was as neat as a pin. The floor was white as chalk and smooth as
glass. The Shakers was all on hand, in clean weskits and meal-bags,
ranged on the floor like milingtery companies, the mails on one side
of the room and the females on tother. They commenst clappin their
hands and singin and dancin. They danced kinder slow at first; but as
they got warmed up they shaved it down very brisk, I tell you. Elder
Uriah, in partickler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness in
his legs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a dubble shuffle
near where I sot I rewarded him with a approvin smile, and sed,
'Hunky, boy! Go it, my gay and festiv cuss!'" Artemus falls in with
the "noble savage" but he declares "Injins is pizin, whar ever found."
He continues:--"They sed I was their brother, &#x0026; wantid for to
smoke the Calomel of Peace with me. They then stole my jerkt beef
blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgin grinder, and scooted with a Wild
Hoop. Durin the Cheaf's techin speech he said he shoold meet me in the
Happy Huntin Grounds. If he duz there will be a fite." He "pores 4th"
his "indignashun" against Salt Lake City, and describes his interview
with Mr. Brigham Young thus:--"My desire was to exhibit my grate show
in Salt Lake City, so I called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull among
the mormins, and axed his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my
banner to the jintle breezis. He lookt at me in a austere manner for a
few minits, and sed, 'Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the
immaculateness of the Mormin Church, and the Latterday revelashuns?'
Sez I, 'I'm on it!' I make it a pint to git along plesunt, tho I
didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin at. He sed I
might show. 'You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?' sez I,
preparin to rite him sum free parsis. 'I hev eighty wives, Mister
Ward. I sertinly am marrid.' 'How do you like it as far as you hev
got?' sed I. He sed 'middlin.'...'Besides these wives you see here,
Mister Ward,' said Yung, 'I hev eighty more in varis parts of this
consecrated land which air Sealed to me.'...His wives fite amung
thrselves so much that he has bilt a fitin room for thare speshul
benefit....Sumtimes they abooz hisself individooally. They hev pulled
the most of his hair out by the roots....When he got eny waze cranky
thay'd shut him up in a dark closit, previsly whippin him arter the
stile of muthers when there orfsprings git onruly." Mr. Ward is
himself married, and his nervous courtship of Betsy Jane was brought
to a close so delicately by the lady that her words deserve to be
recorded:--"I won't listen to your noncents no longer. Jes say rite
strate out what you're drivin at. If you mean gettin hitched, I'M IN!"
Hitched, of course, is the same as "spliced." And so adieu to
Mr. Artemus Ward and his American humour....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">DEFENCE OF CANADA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Public</hi> questions involving a known
proportion of explosive elements turn up sometimes very
inopportunely. One such, and an exceedingly delicate one, has just
done so. The exposed, and, according to the opinion of some highly
respectable authorities, the indefensible, position of Canada, in the
event of war with the United States--which awful calamity may Heaven
avert!--asks consideration at a very unfortunate time. It is a subject
which the Government both in London and in Washington, and which the
people of the United Kingdom and the people of the States, would have
been glad to let remain on the shelf where it has been left unnoticed
for a long course of years. Many and good reasons for avoiding, if it
were possible, the discussion of it make themselves felt on both sides
of the Atlantic. A turn of affairs, however, has unexpectedly thrust
it upon public attention. Some practical decision in relation to it
must be come to; and hence it is desirable to look it manfully in the
face, to consider dispassionately its various bearings, and to do
whatever sound statesmanship shall deem right to be done, in a frank,
inoffensive, neighbourly spirit.</p>
<p>There are certain preliminaries which, we imagine, must be taken
for granted. The first is, that this country would offer no obstacle
to the assumption by Canada of formal, separate, nor, indeed, to the
annexation of herself to the American Republic, if, through her
legitimate constitutional organs, she should declare her preference
for a transference of her troth. The days are long gone by since
England would have thought it concerned either her interests or her
honour to retain an unwilling colony. The second is, that so long as
Canada wishes to preserve unbroken the tie which connects her with the
British empire, England will not permit that tie to be severed by
force from without. The leaders of political opinion of all parties
have pronounced the opposite course incompatible with the maintenance
of our national honour. The third is, that the mutual position of
Canada and the United States is far different from what it was before
the outbreak of the civil war. The Republic has become a formidable
military Power, and, as such, inspires apprehensions which would have
been groundless four years ago. In her present condition, Canada,
apart from our protection, could offer no effectual resistance to an
armed aggression by her neighbour; and therefore the tenour of her
relations with the States would be mainly determined by the policy
which the States' Government might think fit to adopt. With all the
aid which England might afford her in case of a contest, her
disadvantages would be many and serious. The question whether she can
be rendered more secure, especially against the first brunt of a
hostile invasion, seems an inevitable one. As against the military
power developed by the neighbouring Republic, Canada is at present
defenceless. If assailed, Canada is to be defended. How best may
Canada be defended, on the understanding that England is to stand by
her whenever need requires? This is the problem which is just now
seeking solution.</p>
<p>Two plans are before the public. We shall not affect to strike a
balance between their respective merits and demerits; this we prefer
to leave to the judgment of our readers. All that we propose doing is
to submit a general outline of each and to state, as clearly as we are
able the arguments by which each is supported.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Government propose, on the basis of Colonel Jervois's
report, to put Quebec into a defensible condition by the erection of
suitable fortifications, on the consent of the Canadians to do the
same for Montreal and Toronto. Any attempt to hold the entire line of
frontier would, it is assumed owing to its great extent, overtask the
strength of the colony and of the kingdom combined. It will not,
therefore, be made. The strategical arrangement which Ministers
recommend, as at once feasible and likely to prove effective, is the
choice of these more vulnerable points for the purpose of making them
impregnable, at least for a time.  It is taken for granted that any
<pb n="270"/> invading force hurled against Canada by the United
States would, in point of numbers, greatly overmatch such military
force as we might permanently station in the colony, as well as any
militia which the colonists could themselves raise and maintain. All
that can be done at present is to secure against fearful odds the
smaller army until the whole military strength of the United Kingdom
could be rendered available against the aggressor. These proposed
strongholds would, it is said, answer the purpose. On the approach of
a hostile army too formidable to be grappled with in the open country,
every soldier in Canada would be placed behind stone walls, which
would counterbalance the disparity of numbers. It would be hazardous
for the assailants to overrun the province, leaving these garrisons
unreduced in their rear. They would be compelled, therefore, to sit
down before them, and formally besiege them--an operation which would
probably consume some months. Meantime this country would pour into
the colony whatever amount of men it could command, and all the evil
consequences of a surprise would thus be obviated.</p>
<p>The other plan of defence, originally sketched by Mr. Lowe in the
recent debate in the Commons and since supported by the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi>, is as nearly as possible the opposite of
that proposed by her Majesty's Ministers. It starts from the
assumption that, should war unhappily break out between this kingdom
and the Western Republic, Canada would be for the former the worst
possible battle-field within the whole range of her choice. As a base
of operations, it would lie at a most inconvenient distance from the
source of her supplies, with which, moreover, direct communication
would be open only six months in the year; whereas, to the enemy it
would be always accessible, being close at hand for any amount of men,
commissariat, and ammunition which his exigencies might demand. While
it would drain our strength to the utmost, it would give opportunity
to the United States to effect the greatest possible injury at the
least possible cost. It offers, for these reasons alone, precisely the
ground upon which the Republic would wish the conflict to be waged,
and it would be a grave strategical error for us to accept it. Our
policy ahould rather consist in forcing the foe to employ all his
available forces in distant quarters, in fastening upon his most vital
points, in putting him upon the defensive, and making him feel the
largest share of the sacrifices and miseries inflicted by the scourge
of war.</p>
<p>The arguments by which this proposal is sustained, besides those
which are obvious on the face of it, may be thus cursorily stated. It
would enable us to withdraw at once the military force which we now
maintain in the colony, which, it is alleged, is sufficiently large to
engender ill-will, but not powerful enough to ensure safety. Modern
artillery can speedily reduce the most solid fortifications,
especially if isolated for several months together, as they would be
in Canada, and the proposed fortresses, instead of proving a temporary
shelter for an inferior force, would serve rather as traps in which
the pick of our troops would be shut up and taken. Besides, if we once
fairly commit ourselves to the scheme of defending Canada by
fortifying her frontier, and involve her in a share of the
undertaking, we become pledged to go through with it at any cost, and
however impolitic. The works which we erect will be useless until they
are armed, and, when armed, will be worse than useless without
adequate garrisons. The expenditure required for them will not only be
immediate, but must continue, even though peace should remain
unbroken, through many years, and always on an increasing scale. We
shall be sure to sink an enormous amount of treasure, which, in the
event of peace, will be sheer waste, and, in the event of war, will
compel us to adopt a line of defence which, above all others, we
should strive to avoid.</p>
<p>Such are the two strategical plans now before the country, The
first is in accordance with traditional ideas; the last is in bold
defiance of them, The soundness of either of them will be judged of
according to the habits and standards of thought most in favour with
those to whose choice they are submitted. Both of them have been
framed with a view to the most effectual defence of Canada, should
Canada be assailed. But Canada is exposed to aggression by the
American Republic alone, and the only conceivable motive for that
aggression is a desire, through our province, to inflict a wound upon
us. The pith of the alternative is, whether we shall cover our most
vulnerable part with defensive armour, to be worn at all times, or
whether we shall trust to our own weapon of offence, and to our skill
in wielding it, whenever driven to do so, just how and where it will
be most dreaded. Some would feel more safe under the first system,
some under the last. Neither plan would afford a fair pretext for
quarrel, nor, perhaps, would either present temptation. But it is
urged on behalf of Mr. Lowe's suggestion that, while it would remove
every possible excuse for attack, it would also convince America that,
in case of the attack being made by her, she must look for the return
blow where it will most painfully tell home upon her.</p></div2>

<p>By the Moravian we have intelligence from New York to the morning
of the 12th inst. The war news, which consists mostly of rumours, is
confused, and in many cases contradictory. Sherman's movements are
surrounded with mystery, all the reports respecting his movements
having proceeded from refugees, prisoners, or scouts. Sherman is
reported to have occupied Choran, and is also said to have defeated
Cheatham's corps, which was moving to the assistance of
Hardee. General Johnston is supposed to have attacked General Sherman
in front, and is said to have been defeated. The locality of the
battle is, however, not given.</p>
<p>Nothing was certainly known of any Federal advance from Wilmington;
but it was rumoured in Washington that General Schofield had had an
engagement in North Carolina. A body of Federals, advancing from
Newbern, was said to have arrived near Kingston, in North
Carolina.</p>
<p>Admiral Dalhgren has captured Fort White, George Town, South
Carolina, with fifteen guns. In making the attack, the Admiral's
flagship was sunk by a torpedo.</p>
<p>Sheridan, after a long period of inaction, appears to have given a
good account of himself. He met Early between Stanton and
Charlottesville, and routed the Confederates. In the engagement the
Federals, who are said to have lost only ten men, took General Early's
Staff, eighty-seven officers, 1100 soldiers, seven guns, and a large
number of waggons.</p>
<p>Of the doings of General Grant and of General Lee there are
nothing but rumours of the vaguest kind. Governor Vance had appealed
to the people of North Carolina for provisions for General Lee's army,
and was said to have declared that for some months General Lee's
troops must depend on North Carolina and Virginia for support.</p>
<p>The Confederate Senate has passed, by a majority of one vote, a
bill for arming negroes. It was said that some negro soldiers had been
seen confronting the Federal pickets.</p>
<p>The inauguration of President Lincoln and Vice-President Andrew
Johnson passed off with the usual ceremonies. The President never
appeared to so much advantage as on the solemn occasion of his
resuming power, with general approval, for a new term; but it is not
difficult to gather, from the descriptions given in the New York
papers and by the correspondents of English journals, that the
Vice-President was drunk--he stammered out a few broken sentences in
tipsy glorificaton of himself as a "plebeian," to the disgust and
shame of all who assisted at the ceremony. The New York journals
stigmatise Mr. Johnson's conduct, and some recommend him to
resign.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has been officially informed of England's approval of
the recent Canadian legislation regarding Southern refugees. The
Canadian passport order has been rescinded, and it has also been
agreed not to increase the naval force on the lakes.</p>
<p>The Federal Senate has confirmed President Lincoln's appbintment of
Mr. M'Culloch to the secretaryship of the Treasury. The new Secretary
has expressed his disapproval of issues of paper money, and his
resolve to promote a return to specie payments.</p>
<p>Seventeen States have ratified the Constitutional amendment to
abolish and prohibit slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>The celebration for the Union victories by land and sea, which was
to have taken place in New York on the 4th of March, but was postponed
on account of the inclemency of the weather, took place on the 6th
inst., under circumstances of more than usual brilliancy and
success. The display had rarely been equalled in New York. The people
of the States of California, Nevada, and Oregon also observed the day
in an enthusiastic manner.</p>
<p>The United States Consul at Matamoras had left, and arrived at New
Orleans, the reason of his expulsion being the non-recognition of the
French and Mexican authorities in Mexico by the United States.</p>
<p>On the 7th inst. an express-train from Washington for New York and
a passenger-train from Philadelphia for New York came into
collision. Nine persons were killed, and forty others received
injuries. Nearly all the sufferers were soldiers, several of them
being returned prisoners.</p></div2>

<p>....Chang, otherwise Sing-woo-bah, the great Chinese giant, is
coming. it is time. We have had rather a surfeit of dwarfs lately;
and, by way of a change, it might be as well to try a course of
monstrosities running large. When Captain Lemuel Gulliver was tired of
Liliput he went to Brobdignag. Sing-woo-bah, is said to have been last
seen abroad at Shanghai, on the night of the last full moon, looking
over a wall seven feet six inches high. He is to be accompanied by a
pianist, and a suite of Chinese servants, from the comprador to the
shoe-sole chalker. Chang, alias Sing-woo-bah, will, doubtless, draw. A
giant, however, labours under this disadvantage, that, beyond wearing
a field marshal's uniform, selling photographs of himself and grinning
in an idiotic manner, he is seldom able to do anything. Now a dwarf,
as a rule, can be taught to sing, dance, recite, and attitudinise, and
is often, as the Yankee showman called his kangaroo, "an amoozin'
little cuss," and as full of tricks as a waggonload of monkeys with
their tails burnt off. I remember once, in New York, trying very hard
to persuade P. T. Barnum to get up an ethnological tea-party and
invite to meet the subscriber, the Irish and French giants, the Nova
Scotian giantess, the Albino Family, Commodore Nutt, Minnie Warren,
and the Wild Man of Tehuantepec, all of whom were at that moment among
the attractions of his marvellous museum on Broadway. The great
showman did not disapprove of the idea, but he pointed out to me its
impracticability. The dwarfs, he explained, were so very irritable,
and the giants were such fools.</p>
<p>The which reminds me of a little anecdote of P. T. B., who is one
of the dryest humourists I ever met with, and "not half a bad fellow,"
as fellows go. On board the river-steamers in the States they feed you
for a moderate outlay (seventy-five cents a meal) very sumptuously,
but the portions supplied are usually of microscopic
dimensions. Barnum had taken passage by one of these stately Noah's
arks, say, from Albany to New York. He called, at tea-time, for a
beefsteak. The negro brought him the usual little, shrivelled mite of
broiled flesh, certainly not sufficient for more than two
mouthfuls. Barnum poised the morsel on his fork, scanned it
critically, as though it were a sample of steak submitted to his
inspection, and then returned it to the waiter, saying, "Yes; that's
what I mean. Bring me some of it...."</p></div2>

<p>....Some member should move for a return of the number of times the
"battle of the guns" has been fought in the house this Session. Again
this question has been raised with a kind of dismal humour faintly
reminding one of the organized witticisms of his ballot-speeches by
Mr. Berkeley, and this as a sequitur to a severely accentuated palaver
on English policy in the United States affairs, which Mr. Berkeley as
a member of Parliament, independent in every possible sense of the
term, whether applied to politics or to language, had a safe and
harmless right to deliver. Probably the name of Peacocke will not
convey any extraordinary notions of eminence in politics and influence
in Parliament to the world in America, or the swelling talk and fussy
bombast of the member for Maldon might have deserved and invoked a
more pointed rebuke than was conveyed in the grim irony of Sir Henry
Willoughby, when, with a sarcastic smile on his lips, he conjured
Mr. Peacocke not to involve his country in a war with America. The
Americans are so sensitive in their feelings towards England that they
may even be roused by a voice from Little Pedlington; and therefore it
behoves Mr. Peacocke to be cautious and moderate, conscious as he must
be of the responsibility which lies upon him....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our Coast Defences.</hi>--Mr. <hi

of a war with America, and urged that our harbours and dockyards were
in an almost defenceless condition.--Mr. Peacocke and Mr. Baillie
followed in a similar strain, while Sir H. Willoughby and Mr. Forster
condemned the use of irritating language towards the United

armed with 110-pounder Armstrong and the old 68-pounder guns, which
could resist the attack of a wooden fleet. As regarded iron-plated
ships, our own ironclads could look after them, if it became necessary
to do so, and next year the Government hoped to be in a better
position for deciding upon the gun to be adopted for general use.--Sir
<hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> said the plans for the
fortification of Quebec and Montreal were very simple and very
complete, but he must urge the Admiralty to place a flotilla of
gun-boats on the Canadian lakes.--After some further conversation the

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">AmErica.</hi>--Earl <hi
rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> laid upon the table of the House a
letter, with an inclosure from Mr. Adams, the representative of the
United States, declaring that he was commanded by the President to
deliver a notice in the month of March of the desire of the Government
of the United States that the reciprocity treaty between this country
and the United States should terminate, and that accordingly the
treaty would terminate in twelve months from the date of the delivery
of the notice. The inclosure was merely a vote of the Congress, and
consented to by the president, declaring that it was no longer to the
interest of the United States that the treaty should be continued. The
noble Earl said that the act of violence perpetrated by the so-called
Confederate States on the lakes completely justified the United States
in giving notice of the termination of the convention, for it was not
to be expected that the United States would permit such acts of
violence to be repeated, nor was it to be expected that the United
States should submit passively to such acts of violence without means
of retaliation. He entertained hopes, with regard to the reciprocity
treaty, that a renewal of it could be arranged with modifications,
which would be more advantageous to the United States, and which they
might consider more just to themselves. Mr. Adams had informed him of
the result of the negotiations which had taken place between the
President and the so-called Confederates. The noble Earl then
expressed a hope that when he should present to him a notice of the
termination of the reciprocity treaty he should find that the
President and the Government of the United States were ready to
consider a proposition by which a small and limited armament might be
kept upon the lakes for the purpose of the police on both sides, and
also of a renewal of this reciprocity treaty on terms which should be
agreed to by both parties, and which might be negotiated during the
twelve months which would elapse before the treaty would cease to be
in operation. Of course, Mr. Adams did not offer to give any assurance
upon the subject, but the words which he used induced the noble Earl
to trust that such would be the case. He should be extremely sorry if
anything should occur in this country to bring about an opposite
result. He therefore much regretted some expressions that had been
used and some speeches that had been made tending to excite in the
United States a disposition unfavourable to this country. He believed
that in this respect this country had behaved wrongfully to the United
States, and had given them just cause to complain of the unfriendly
spirit thown in this country towards them, Her Majesty's Government
intended to pursue the same course with regard to the United States as
heretofore. A new Minister would leave London to-morrow to represent
her Majesty at Washington. The noble Earl concluded by passing an
encomium upon Lord Lyons, the Minister of the past, and Sir Frederick
Bruce, the Minister of the future. The noble Earl then took a review
of the policy pursued by her Majesty's Government, towards America,
and maintained that the course they had adopted was the wise and
prudent one. They had appointed a new Minister from England to
Washington, and had instructed him to carry out the same policy which
Lord Lyons had followed with such satisfaction to both countries.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi

The Defences Of Canada.</hi></p>
<p>The House went into Committee of Supply, when</p>
<p>The Marquis of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hartington</hi> moved the votc
of &#x00A3;50,000 for the Canadian defences, and entered into a most
elaborate statement of our relations with Canada and the defenceless
state of the colony. He stated that the Canadians were quite prepared
to bear their share of the expense of keeping those fortifications in
an efficient condition.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bentinck</hi> thought it was a useless
expenditure, and capable of doing more harm than good; and he
therefore moved that the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 be omitted from the
votes. If we should have a war with the United States that sum would
be totally inefficient for the defence of the Canadian provinces. He
objected to the vote in <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>, because it
would be likely to draw on the evil which we were anxious to avoid;
and to erect forts would be holding out a challenge to the United
States which they might be induced to accept.</p>
<p>General <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi> considered that England was
bound to protect her colonies, and, with regard to Canada, we must
defend it with the whole strength of the country. He would not go into
the question of whether the grant was enough or not, but the value he
attached to it was, that it would convince the colony and America that
we would protect Canada to the last.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Butler-Johnstone</hi> objected to the
smallness of the vote.</p>
<p>Major <hi rend="smallcaps">Anson</hi> thought it would be
impossible for us to hold Canada if the Americans thought proper to
seize it; but there was no reason to suppose that any such attempt
would ever be made by the Americans.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Adderley</hi> gave his assent to the
vote.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Bury</hi> thought it would be necessary
to form earthworks at certain points in Canada, by which an invading
army must come, and by that means a comparatively small force would be
able to hold at bay a numerically much stronger force.</p>
<p>After a discussion, in which Mr. Watkin, Mr. Haliburton,
Mr. S. Lefevre, and Lord r. Montagu took part,</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Fortescue</hi>, on the part of the
Government, admitted that they were bound to support the independence
of the Canadians; but at the same time the Government felt that the
colony ought to make some effort to defend itself.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> expressed his opinion that
Canada could be defended.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lowe</hi> replied to the arguments that
had been used in favour of defending Canada. He denied that the
Americans would be compelled to go by any particular route to invade
Canada, because they could enter it by at least four or five different
points. The Americans had now the largest army and the most
experienced one in the world, and one that we could not oppose with
any chance of success. We ought therefore to deal candidly with
Canada, and let her know that, although she would find England a warm
friend and ally, who would defend her to the utmost of her power, yet
that she must be prepared to defend herself, for that we could not be
supposed to undertake a defence that would be perfectly hopeless. He
deprecated the Government of this country stirring up the Canadians to
a defence that would be entirely hopeless. Nevertheless, he was not
prepared to take upon himself the responsibility of refusing the
vote. It was only a trifle, and the Government asked for it on its own
responsibility, and he was willing to support the vote, although he
still entertained the same opinion that he had previously
expressed.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> supported the vote, because
to refuse it would discourage the Canadians at a most critical
moment. He scouted the idea of Mr. Lowe that England should allow
America quietly to take possession of Canada without a struggle
because it was possible that the defence might not be successful. If
it should happen that America should go to war with England, that war
would be carried on in every part of the world, so as to make their
victory as expensive and as difficult as possible. It was preposterous
to lay down a principle that an extensive line of frontier in our own
colonies should not be defended, for it was our duty to defend them to
the last.</p>
<p> Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardwell</hi> said that he had been
informed by the American Government that the notice for the
termination of the Reciprocity Treaty would be withdrawn, and that the
passport system would be abolished. He defended the policy of the
Government, and contended that, if necessary, we could defend
Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright</hi> said there was no one in the
country who would attempt effectually to defend Canada against the
whole power of the United States. There was no safety for Canada in
the event of a war between England and America but in the neutrality
of that colony. The sum to be voted was not much for this country, but
he objected to the vote on principle. It had been said that Canada was
to bear the greatest portion of the expenditure, but on what ground
could she be asked to do it? There was no chance of a war between
Canada and America, and if we were to go to war with America the
battle-field would be Canada. On what ground, then, could we ask her
to bear any portion of the expenses? He objected to the vote, not
because it was throwing so much money away, but because it was
inaugurating a policy which we should be compelled to abandon or else
that would lead to the separation of Canada from this country. He did
not object to that colony separating itself from this country, but he
did object to the severance taking place after a feeling of
irritation. He charged the Opposition with being in collusion with the
Government, and called upon the House to take the matter out of the
hands of the Executive Government and not force upon Canada a burden
it could not long bear.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> regretted he could not
have the vote of the hon. gentleman, but it was clear that the vote
met with the approval of the large majority of the members of the
House. This was not a Canadian but an Imperial question, and he
regretted that it should go forth to the world that there was a
difference of opinion upon it. He denied that this defence was
proposed from an anticipation of war, it was simply a matter of
precaution, which every country with a large frontier adopted. He
appealed to the hon. member (Mr. Bentinck) not to divide the
Committee, as it would weaken the effect of the vote.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bentinck</hi> expressed his willingness to
withdraw his amendment, but the Committee would not allow him.</p>
<p>The Committee then divided, when the amendment was negatived by a
majority of 275 to 40.</p>
<p>The veto was therefore agreed to.</p></div2>

<p>On the 5th inst. messages were sent direct from New York to San
Francisco, a distance of nearly four thousand miles; the largest
length of wire ever worked over in one circuit. The wires worked well
though it rained at several points on the line.</p>
<p>A Canadian journal states, on information which it has reason to
believe is correct, that the number of Canadians who have enlisted in
the United States army since the beginning of the war is 43,000. Of
this number 35,000 were French Canadians, no less than 14,000 of whom
have died on the battle-field.</p></div2>

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 19th ult.</p>
<p>President Davis had sent to the Confederate Congress a message in
which he stated that further and more energetic legislation was
required, as the country was environed with perils, and Richmond in
greater danger than heretofore during the war. The militia laws needed
modification, and a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was almost
indispensable. If the measures recommended by him were adopted, and if
the Congress and people co-operated, the South might enter upon the
coming campaign with cheerful confidence in the result. General Grant,
the message said, had refused to meet General Lee in a conference for
the purpose of negotiations for peace. The North would accept only
abject and unconditional submission, and the South had no choice but
to continue the contest to its final issue. With 2,000,000 dols. in
coin the armies of Virginia and North Carolina could be supplied for
the remainder of the year; and President Davis recommended measures
for making all coin within the Confederacy available for the uses of
the troops. He also recommended other measures for the re-plenishment
of the Confederate Treasury, and for the impressment of provisions and
stores. The Confederate Congress had subsequently adjourned; and it
may be presumed that the bills required by President Davis had been
passed.</p>
<p>General Lee, in an order to the army commanding an observance of
the 10th of March (the day appointed by President Davis for a general
fast) as a day of fasting and prayer, tells his soldiers that God had
sorely chastened them; and speaks of the present time as one of
trouble, contrasting it with the days when God delivered them from
their enemies.</p>
<p>The James River canal is being repaired, and President Davis has
called upon the farmers to aid in the work. Vigorous efforts are being
made at Richmond to organise coloured troops, and all whites able to
bear arms have been draughted into the service. President Lincoln has
made a speech in which he declared that the Confederates would stand
out as long as they could draw upon the last branch of their
resources, and that he rejoiced to see the end so near.</p>
<p>General Sherman was gradually continuing his forward
movement. After occupying Cheraw he marched on Fayetteville, which he
reached and took possession of on the 12th ult. General Hardee
retreated before Sherman, keeping in his front at a moderate
distance. General Sherman's advance was not altogether unopposed, for
the Confederate cavalry under Hampton attacked Kilpatrick inflicting
on him great loss and taking several hundred prisoners. According to
the Federal account, Kilpatrick in his turn attacked Hampton, and
recovered all he had lost. The river communication between
Fayetteville and Wilmington had been opened, so that Sherman at the
former place had a secure base.</p>
<p>While Sherman was thus marching through the centre of the
Carolinas, General Schofield had made his way from Wilmington to
Kinston. In front of the latter place his advance seems to have been
attacked by Bragg, and to have suffered some loss in prisoners. Next
day, however, Schofield's main body came up, and Bragg's further
assaults were repulsed with great loss to him. He retreated on Kinaton
and afterwards to Goldsborough. At Kinston he destroyed a ram and a
large quantity of stores. The place was occupied by the Federals.</p>
<p>General Sheridan reports his arrival at Fredericksburg Railway,
crossing the South Anna River on the 15th ult. He continued to damage
the James River Canal to Goochland, whence he turned northward and
destroyed the bridges on both Annas. At Virginia Central Railway
Bridge the Confederates attempted resistance, but were driven off,
losing three cannon.</p>
<p>Mobile despatches of the 14th ult. state that the city was strongly
menaced; twenty-one of the enemy's vessels were in sight. Great
activity prevailed among the enemy in the Lower Bay. Maury recommends
the inhabitants to prepare for an attack, and has ordered
non-combatants to leave.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge despatches of the 9th report the Confederate General
Forrest at Macon, Georgia, with 15,000 cavalry, to which he was daily
receiving additions.</p>
<p>The Jersey Senate has rejected the constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>Gold, on the 18th ult., was quoted at New York at 165&#x00B7;.</p>
<p>The breaking-up of the ice on the Susquehanna and other rivers by
sudden thaw has caused the inundation of the districts along their
courses, and millions of dollars' worth of property is estimated to
have been destroyed. The petroleum districts in Pennsylvania have been
the greatest sufferers, and Oil City has been wholly submerged.</p>
<p>Mr. James Gordon Bennett, of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi>, has been offered, and has declined, the French
mission. Mr. John Bigelow, Acting Charg&#x00E9; d'Affaires, has been
appointed.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Lower House of the Canadian Parliament has adopted, by a
majority of 99 to 33 votes, the address to the Queen praying for a
confederation of the British North American Provinces.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government has proposed a vote of 1,000,000 dols. for
the permanent defence of the country and 350,000 dols. for the
expenses of the volunteers on the frontier.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister announces that the Government must maintain
the police and militia on the frontier so long as the war lasts, and
fulfil their obligations as good neighbours to the United
States.</p></div2>

<p>A Confederate ram, the Stonewall (late Olinda) is in great straits
cruising about the Spanish and Portuguese coast. The first we heard of
her was that she had put into Corunna for repairs, and that the
Federal ships Niagara (frigate) and Sacramento (frigate) had taken up
their stations outside the port. The Stonewall left last week; but,
instead of a fight coming off, we have the following telegram from
Lisbon, dated Monday:--"The Confederate ram Stonewall has arrived here
from Ferrol, where she left the Federal war-steamers Niagara and
Sacramento. The Portuguese authorities have ordered the Stonewall to
leave the harbour, and have manned the forts." By a later telegram
from Lisbon we learn that the Stonewall quitted the Tagus on Tuesday;
and that the Federal cruisers, which had arrived that morning,
attempted also to leave the Tagus before the expiration of the term of
twenty-four hours required to elapse between the sailing of a vessel
of one belligerent and the subsequent departure of an armed ship
belonging to the other belligerent. The forts at Belem consequently
opened fire on the Federal steamers, and a shot struck the Niagara on
the poop and killed a seaman. Both the Niagara and the Sacremento, it
is added, then anchored. The Confederate ram Stonewall was built at
Bordeaux ostensibly for the Danish Government. She is about 1600 tons
burden, has a 12-foot prow, is iron-clad, and is armed with three
guns--viz., a 300-pounder forward, and two 200-pounders aft. Her speed
is about ten knots, and she has a crew of about eighty hands. The
Niagara is of 4582 tons. She has a crew of 450 hands. Her armament
consists of fifteen 200-pounders. The Sacramento's tonnage is
1367. She has a crew of about 180 hands. Her armament consists of two
120-pounders and eight 68-pounders. The speed of the Niagara and
Sacramento is about twelve knots.</p></div2>
