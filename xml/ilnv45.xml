<p rend="center">THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE ALABAMA AND THE<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Kearsarge.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We </hi>published last week an Engraving from
the sketch which was sent us by Mr. James Bryant, owner of the yacht
Hornet, representing the final scene of the combat between the Alabama
and the Kearsarge, a few miles off Cherbourg, on the morning of
Sunday, the 19th ult. We are now enabled, by the courtesy of
Mr. Robert Lancaster, of Hindley Hall, Wigan, to present our readers
with another Illustration of the same subject, which appears on our
front page. Mr. Lancaster is the owner of the yacht Deerhound, which
was present during the whole of the battle, and which was happily
instrumental in saving the lives of Captain Semmes, thirteen officers,
and twenty-six men of the Alabama, when they had leaped into the water
as their ship went down. Whilst we may congratulate this gentleman
upon the service to humanity which he was thus enabled to perform, we
are bound no less to thank him for aiding us, by the work of his
pencil, in producing a graphic record of the extraordinary spectacle
that he witnessed. Mr. Lancaster says in his letter, which accompanied
this drawing:--</p>
<p>"I have endeavoured to take the sketch just at the moment the
Alabama was going down. We were then about one hundred yards from the
sinking vessel, and about twice that distance from the Federal ship,
and between the two. Our two boats were a little ahead of us and
pulling towards the wreck and the crew, most of whom had jumped
overboard and were floating about on loose spars and other things. One
of the Alabama's boats, after having taken the wounded on board the
Kearsarge, returned and picked up another boatfull, and then came
alongside the Deerhound, where, to prevent her falling into the hands
of the Federals, she was sunk by some of the Alabama's men. The sides
of the Kearsarge were very much cut up, nearly all the chain-plating
being exposed on the starboard side. Just as the Alabama went down,
the mainmast, which had been struck by a shot, fell. The Kearsarge's
boats were not lowered until after the Alabama had disappeared
altogether. I shall be most happy if this sketch will be of any use to
you. It is the most correct you will be able to get as to the position
of the vessels and boats."</p>
<p>We have also engraved on another page of this Number a drawing
which has been made from the plan and information which have been
supplied to our Artist by Mr. George T. Fullam, an officer of the
Alabama. It was he who conveyed the wounded from that vessel to the
Kearsarge, and then came on board the Deerhound, which brought him to
Southampton. He has remarked to our Artist that it is an incident
worth noting, with regard to the damage done to the spars of the
Alabama, that the throat-blocks of both the main and mizen gaffs were
shot away. As we published last week the official report of Captain
Semmes to the agent of the Confederate Government in London, we here
subjoin a letter from the Federal commander, Captain Winslow, who
writes from Cherbourg as follows:--</p>
<q><p>Sir,--There have been so many nonsensical publications on the
engagement which took place between the Alabama and the Kearsarge that
it is my wish that a correction should be made.</p>
<p>In the first place, no challenge was sent by Captain Winslow; to
have done so would have been to have violated the order of the Navy
Department. On the contrary, Captain Winslow received a request from
Captain Semmes not to leave, as he would fight the Kearsarge, and
would only occupy a day or two in his preparations. Five days,
however, elapsed before they were completed. The Kearsarge's battery
consists of seven guns, two 11-inch Dahlgren's, four 32-pounders, one
light rifle 28-pounder. The battery of the Alabama consisted of one
100-pounder rifle, one heavy 68 ditto, six 32-pounders, that is, one
more gun than the Kearsarge. In the wake of the engines on the outside
the Kearsarge had stopped up and down her sheet chains. These were
stopped by marline to eye bolts, which extended some twenty feet, and
was done by the hands of the Kearsarge; the whole was covered by light
plank, to prevent dirt collecting. It was for the purpose of
protecting the engines when there was no coal in the upper part of the
bunkers, as was the case when the action took place. The Alabama had
her bunkers full, and was equally protected. The Kearsarge went into
action with a crew of 162 officers and men. The Alabama, by report of
the Deerhound's officers, had 150.</p>
<p>The Kearsarge steamed to sea in order that no questions of
neutrality jurisdiction should be raised; when far enough, she turned
short round and steered immediately for the Alabama for close
action. The Alabama fired, as she was coming down on her, two
broadsides and part of another; no one shot came on board of the
Kearsarge. The Kearsarge then sheered and opened on the Alabama,
trying to get nearer. The action lasted one hour and two minutes from
the first to the last shot. The Kearsarge received twenty-eight shots
above and below, thirteen about her hull; the best shots were abaft
the mainmast, two shots which cut the chain stops, the shell of which
broke the casing of wood covering. They were too high to have damaged
the boilers had they penetrated. The Kearsarge was only slightly
damaged, and I supposed the action for hot work had just commenced
when it ended. Such stuff as the Alabama firing when she was going
down, and all such talk, is twaddle. The Alabama towards the last
hoisted sail to get away, when the Kearsarge was laid across her bows,
and would have raked had she not surrendered, which she had done, and
was trying to get her flags down and showing a white flag over the
stern. The officers of the Alabama on board the Kearsarge say that she
was a complete slaughter-house, and was completely torn to
pieces. This is all I know of the Alabama. Yours, &#x0026;c.,</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">John A. Winslow</hi>,
Captain.</p></q>
<p>It may be observed that Captain Winslow does not mention the way in
which the officers and crew of the Alabama were saved upon the sinking
of their ship. It is clear, however, that he made no such attempt to
rescue them as a generous enemy would have done; but the log kept on
board the Deerhound records that, when the yacht was passing the
Kearsarge, it was "requested to assist in saving the Alabama's crew."
Both Captain Semmes and Mr. Lancaster have testified that the boats of
the Kearsarge were not sent for that purpose until after the Alabama
had disappeared, though the Alabama had not only surrendered but had
sent her wounded to be received on board the Kearsarge as prisoners of
war. It is therefore probable that, if it had not been for
Mr. Lancaster's prompt interference, Captain Semmes and his brave
comrades would have shared the fate of Mr. Herbert Llewellyn, the
surgeon (an Englishman, the son of a clergyman in Wiltshire), who
perished with their sinking vessel. The Deerhound has therefore
earned, in our opinion, the fairest honours of the day. She was the
object of much curiosity and admiration during her stay at
Southhampton from the Sunday to the Wednesday, when she left that port
for Hull. As we have given her a conspicuous place in the Engraving on
our front page, it may be stated that she is entered on the lists of
the Royal Yacht Squadron of Cowes, the Royal Mersey Yacht Club of
Liverpool, and the (Irish) Royal Western Yacht Club stationed at
Queenstown. She was built, as it happens, upon the same model as the
Alabama, in the same shipyard at Birkenhead, by Messrs. Laird and
Co. She is a three-masted vessel, built of steel, with a
screw-propeller, with a tonnage (builders' measurement) of about 190,
and engines of a nominal power of seventy horse. When in her usual
trim she steams twenty knots, being about two knots beyond the speed
of the Alabama. She carries a crew of thirteen men. The Deerhound now
proceeds from Hull to Norway. Mr. Lancaster and his captain
indignantly deny the statement that an arrangement was made with the
Deerhound by Captain Semmes, before the engagement, that the yacht
should hover about the combatants and render assistance to the
Alabama. They knew that Captain Semmes had determined to engage the
Kearsarge, but no arrangement of any kind was thought of.</p>
<p>The famous Alabama herself, which was originally called "No. 290,"
came from Messrs. Laird's building-yard in July, 1862, and received
her armament and crew at Terceira, in the Azores, whence she started
upon a career most destructive to the maritime commerce of the United
States. She is said to have captured and burnt, in less than two
years, one hundred American vessels. She was a barque-rigged wooden
propeller, of 1040 ton's register. Length of keel, 210 ft.; length
over all, 220 ft.; beam, 32 ft.; depth, 17 ft. Her engines, built by
the same firm, were two horizontal ones, each of 300-horse power, with
stowage for 350 tons of coals. Her sails, carried at all times, were
as follows:--Fore, fore topmast, staysail jib, two large trysails; the
usual square sails on fore and main, with the exception of the
mainsail, which was a flying one; spanker and gaff-topsails; all
standing rigging wire. Double wheel, with motto engraved thereon,
"Aide toi, et Dieu t'aidera," placed just before the mizenmast. Bridge
in the centre, just before the funnel. She carried five boats--viz.,
cutter and launch amidships, gig and whaleboat between the main and
mizen masts, and dingy astern. The main deck was pierced for twelve
guns, elliptic stern, billet head, high bulwarks; cabin accommodation
first class; ward-room furnished with a handsome suite of state-rooms;
steerage--starboard for midshipmen, port for engineers; next came
engine-room, and coal-bunkers; then the berth deck, capable of
accommodating 120 men; under the wardroom were store-rooms; and under
the steerage were shell-rooms; just forward of the firearms came the
hold; next the magazines, and forward of all the boatswains' and
sailmakers' store-rooms; the hold being under the berth deck.</p>
<p>The Kearsarge, named after a range of hills in Vermont, is a recent
acquisition to the navy of the United States; in fact, she is one of
the nine gun-boats completed within three months from the date of the
order given. She is the sister ship of the Tuscarora, whose presence
in the Solent, during the visit of the Confederate cruiser Nashville
(since destroyed), occasioned considerable excitement some time
since.</p>
<p>A correspondence is published between Captain Winslow and
Mr. Bonfils, the French Confederate agent. Captain Winslow claims as
his prisoners those of the Alabama's crew rescued by pilot-boats, and
brought into Cherbourg. He allowed the pilot-boats to save the
prisoners, from motives of humanity, but if the prisoners endeavour to
free themselves from the obligation they must expect to meet no mercy
another time. Mr. Bonfils replies that there is nothing to hinder even
a surrendered prisoner from escaping if he can, and he declines to act
as a go-between between Captain Winslow and persons he does not even
name; nor can he understand how Captain Winslow can claim to hold
prisoners within the territory of the French empire.</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the steamer Edinburgh we have intelligence from New York to the
morning of the 18th ult.</p>
<p>General Grant has performed an important operation--that of moving
his army to the right bank of the James River. After turning
Spottsylvania Courthouse and Sexton's Junction, he has now turned the
lines of the Chickahominy and the northern defences of Richmond
itself. It remains to be seen what he will benefit by the change. The
mode in which Grant accomplished the flank march will be read with
interest when the details arrive. So far as the telegrams furnish
information, he seems to have covered the embarkation of Smith's corps
at White House by a cavalry demonstration on the right; then to have
made a show of forcing Bottom's Bridge, while the bulk of the army
marched rapidly down the Chickahominy, crossed at Long Bridge, and,
moving east of White Oak Swamp, struck the James in two columns, one
opposite Fort Powhattan, the other at Hasall's Landing, opposite
Bermuda Hundred. While the army was marching to the James, General
Smith's corps, carried in steam-transports from White House, landed at
City Point, as may be inferred, and, moving up the right bank of the
Appomattox, attacked and carried the southern defences of
Petersburg. Hancock came up, it is said, and took post on Smith's
left, and rumour avers that Petersburg fell into the hands of the
Federals the next day. Sheridan's cavalry in the meantime had been
encountered and defeated by the Confederates, but where the telegram
does not say. There appears to have been fighting at Bottom's Bridge,
where Grant crossed the Chickahominy, but with what result is
unknown. The development of Hunter's advance in the higher valleys of
the Shenandoah must have seriously alarmed General Lee, if it be true
that he had sent off a whole corps to attack Hunter and two divisions
to defend Lynchburg. We are not informed at all of the movements of
Lee himself; but it may be inferred that he has moved through Richmond
and taken post on the south. Nor are we told how Hunter got through
the Blue Ridge to Lovingston and Amherst. Upon these points we must
wait for information. Richmond journals discuss the military situation
in a very defiant tone, and regard with derision the idea of their
capital being captured.</p>
<p>The latest Federal accounts of General Sherman's operations in
Georgia represented that, on the 12th ult., the Federal army was
within 500 yards of the Confederate position, which was said to extend
from Kenesaw [i.e., Kennesaw] to Lost Mountain. There had been no serious engagement,
and it was reported in New York that General Sherman's troops were
intrenching themselves. A body of 8000 Federals, under General
Sturgis, who had been dispatched from Memphis for the purpose of
frustrating any attempts to impede General Sherman's long line of
communications, had been attacked at Gun Town, in Tennessee, by 10,000
Confederates, under General Forrest, and had been completely
defeated. General Sturgis himself was killed, and all his guns and
stores were captured by the victors, who likewise took a large number
of prisoners.</p>
<p>General Morgan's Confederates had done much damage to the railways
in Kentucky, and had taken, on the 10th ult., the town of Cynthiana,
with two Federal regiments quartered there. On the 11th, however, they
were attacked and defeated by General Burbridge, who made 300 or 400
prisoners and recaptured a few of the Federals taken on the previous
day.</p>
<p>By a vote of eighty-four against fifty-eight the House of
Representatives had repealed the Fugitive Slave Law.</p>
<p>The Senate have rejected the President's amendment of the
Constitution abolishing slavery.</p>
<p>A joint resolution for a final adjournment of Congress on Thursday,
June 23, was adopted.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 emigrants arrived at the port of New York in the
week ending June 4.</p>
<p>There had been a fall in the price of gold. At last accounts it
was quoted at 95&#xBE; per cent premium.</p></div2>

<p>...Our redoubtable "Manhattan," common-councilman of New York and
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi>, has been
summoned before the Military Governor of New York and threatened with
arrest. Pointing to a file of that journal, General Dix told him "that
they had done more harm to the United States than all the New York
papers combined." Only imagine, if we can, the pride of the author
when he heard this! Harm, i' faith; why, Manhattan, sometimes north,
sometimes south, twists about like the revolving lights in a
lighthouse, and flashes now yellow, now rose colour, now blue, all
very pretty to look at, but utterly useless to read by. We knew,
certainly, that there were rocks ahead at New York, and that
Washington was an uncomfortable place to live in; but why imprison a
poor harum-scarum newspaper correspondent for that?...</p>
<p>One is glad to see that the past and present students of
Charing-cross Hospital are about to raise a memorial to the brave
surgeon of the Alabama, Mr. Llewellyn, who went down with that vessel
whilst nobly doing his duty. Both Northern and Southern can show their
sympathies with a brave non-combatant, and his fellow-countrymen may
do it in two places, by either subscribing to the memorial at
Charing-cross or to the one at the little church of his native place
which his fellow-townsmen are about to erect...</p></div2>

<p rend="center">KERBSTONE STOCKBROKERS IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>prevailing mania just now in the city
of New York is that of gambling in stocks. All classes of people are
naturally intent upon converting fictitious "greenbacks" into some
more substantial and enduring property. Hence the universal spirit of
speculation which drives to the stock market merchants and mechanics,
gamblers and gentlemen, politicians and parsons. Railway shares,
mining companies' stock, and everything else that can, by the greatest
stretch of imagination, be supposed to offer a chance of permanent
investment or rapid profit, will command prices far above par; but
more in request than all other marketable securities is the American
eagle impressed upon gold coin. The Federal Secretary of the Treasury
has so flooded the country with paper "promises to pay," that the
holders are extremely doubtful of their validity, and hasten to
transmute this dubious "Chase currency" into the precious
metal. William-street, in the lower part of New York, is the great
theatre of speculation. In this street and Exchange-place, from the
corner of which our sketch is taken, are innumerable stockbrokers'
offices. Every building on each side of the way contains, on every
floor, luxuriously furnished chambers, the occupants of which have
made, are making, or expect to make their millions out of the
fluctuations of the stock market. There are three distinct marts held
in William-street for the sale of speculative commodities:--First, the
"Regular Board of Brokers," an exclusive and aristocratic fraternity,
whose sessions are held in an ex-Masonic lodge-room, and whose
regulations demand a rigorous ballot and a large initiation fee as
qualifications for membership. This organisation comprises men of the
"first families" of America, persons in good society, and its rules
are supposed to exclude all of doubtful commercial integrity. Next in
order comes the "Public Stock Exchange," held in a building on the
east side of the street (to the left of our Engraving), nearly
opposite the "Regular Board." Here assemble those brokers who are
excluded from the orthodox association, whether by their rejection on
ballot, or by their inability or disinclination to comply with its
code, or because its limited number is filled. Notwithstanding that
the "Public Board" is less strict and less expensive than its
neighbour, there are many of its members who have become millionaires
within the past few months by the magnitude and success of their
transactions; they have built superb mansions and established gorgeous
equipages outvieing those of the richest member of the "Regular
Board." Thirdly, and lastly, there is the "Kerbstone" business--the
common whirlpool of all persons of speculative tendencies who have not
sufficient capital or character to obtain admission into either of the
recognised places of Stock Exchange operations. As the session of the
Public Board draws to its close (about two p.m.), an indiscriminate
throng of all varieties of character and grades of rank, from the
"Fifth <pb n="12"/>Avenue Swell" to the Jewish dealer in cast-off clothes, besiege
the doors of the sale-rooms; and the first person who comes out is
assailed with frantic shrieks of "What's Erie?" "How's Rock Island?"
and, more than all, "Where's Gold?" These points having been
ascertained, there is a furious mel&#xE9;e of pecuniary
propositions; purchases and sales are transacted between individuals
who, up to that moment, have never seen each other, and who may never
meet again; for the gainer in the bargain does not always succeed next
day in his search for the loser. "Representative men" of all types
shoulder one another, and scream themselves hoarse in eager endeavours
to outbid or undersell their loud-voiced competitors. It is a frantic
orgie, in which the lust of lucre reigns supreme. Our Engraving
represents William-street, looking southward, from its junction with
Exchange-place. On the left is the entrance to the Public Stock
Exchange. Further down is seen the "fork" of South William, Beaver,
and Hanover streets; and, on the right, at the junction of Beaver and
Hanover streets, is the "down town" establishment of Delmonico, the

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN MAIL STEAMER AT<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Roche's Point.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Every </hi>reader of the London morning papers
is accustomed at the present time to look for some exciting news of
the American war in that column of large type and short paragraphs
which is headed "By Electric and International Telegraph, vi&#xE2;
Roche's Point," with the name, perhaps, of one of the Cunard line of
steamers, which may be half way up St. George's Channel, on her way to
Liverpool, at the moment when this intelligence meets the reader's
eye. We have engraved a Sketch of the Scotia lying off Roche's Point,
at the entrance of Queenstown Harbour, where she is met by one or two
small boats, to bring the telegraphic despatches to land, when not a
moment is lost in transmitting their message by the electric wire to
London, Liverpool, and every other place concerned in obtaining the
earliest American news. At the same time, a portion of the mails are
taken by the Jackal tender, which is also shown in our Engraving, and
conveyed up the harbour to be forwarded by railway from
Cork.</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 25th ult. The reported
capture of Petersburg, referred to in our last Number and stated to
require confirmation, is so far from having been confirmed that (as we
were able to state by telegram last week) Grant has been driven from
it with terrible loss. What, doubtless, gave rise to the statement was
the capture by the Federals, under General Smith, of the outer line of
defences of Petersburg, which were then thought to be its main
line. This occurred on the 15th of June. On the 17th, General Grant's
whole army was before Petersburg, and on that day severe fighting was
reported; on the 18th a general assault on the town was three times
made and repulsed with a loss to the Federals estimated at not less
than from 6000 to 8000 men.</p>
<p>The Confederate works were arranged in a semicircle south of
Petersburg, the flanks resting on the Appomattox River. The Federal
army advanced against them on the 18th in three divisions, the Second
Army Corps on the right, the Ninth in the centre, the Fifth on the
left. Hancock, being wounded, was unable to lead his men, and General
Birney commanded the Federal right. The assault was directed towards
the line of the City Point Railroad. The men were led forward to the
certainty of defeat or death. After getting over a fence they had to
cross a wide field exposed to a cross fire from the Confederate
breastworks. As soon as they were seen they were met with deadly
volleys of musketry, grape, and canister from the Southern
defences. Hundreds fell, many were taken prisoners, the rest retreated
in disorder. Reinforcements having been obtained, the Second Corps
formed another storming party. They tried another point of the works,
but it was worse than the other. Infantry and artillery met them with
a terrific fire, and the heads of the columns were "lost in clouds of
smoke." It was a forlorn hope. Those in front were mown down and
scattered; the remainder broke and fled. While this was the fate of
the Second Corps, the Fifth Corps, on the Federal left, fought with
equal obstinacy, but found the earthworks in front of it
impregnable. The ground over which these troops advanced had evidently
been long prepared, for it was strewed thickly with an abbattis of
felled timber. The Ninth Corps, in the centre, was utterly routed by a
fierce attack of the Confederates, who rushed into the camp through a
terrible artillery fire, fought the Michigan sharpshooters hand to
hand, and drove them from all their positions. The Southern troops
were again withdrawn during the night to their own impregnable
defences.</p>
<p>After these unsuccessful attempts to force the Confederate
position, Grant appears for some days to have done little or
nothing. With his right flank resting on the Appomattox River, and his
left on the plank-road connecting Petersburg with Graysville, he
seems to have<pb n="27"/> pushed forward his outposts as near as he
conceived prudent to the Confederate intrenchments. On the 19th and
20th there was some slight skirmishing, in which the pickets and their
supports were alone engaged; and it was not until the night of the
21st that Grant resumed active operations. Intending, apparently, to
seek a weaker point in the Confederate lines than that against which
the assaults of the 17th and 18th were directed, the two corps which
formed the right of the Federal army were moved on the night of the
21st across the front of the Federal left, in the direction of the
Petersburg and Norfolk Railway. The ostensible motive was to cover
this line of railway and more completely invest the city of
Petersburg, but the ultimate object was to enable the Federal army to
attack the Confederate position at a point almost due south of the
town of Petersburg. For this man&#x153;uvre, however, the
Confederates were fully prepared. A strong force under Hill
intercepted the advancing columns of the Federal right wing and
repulsed them with heavy loss both of men and artillery. The following
day, inspirited by this success, General Hill again resumed the
offensive, and, having managed to separate the Second from the Sixth
Army Corps, attacked the former in the rear and drove it in confusion
to its intrenchments, with an estimated loss of three thousand men. On
the 23rd Grant drew up his entire army in order of battle, and on that
day a general engagement was expected. Heavy firing in the direction
of the position of the rival armies was heard at City Point on that
day, but the results of the battle are not known, or not
published.</p>
<p>President Lincoln visited Grant at City Point on the 21st ult.</p>
<p>General Hunter is said to have been repulsed in an attack upon
Lynchburg, but there is no very definite news respecting his
movements.</p>
<p>General Sheridan has been defeated during his raid with heavy
loss. He claims, however, to have seriously injured the Virginia
Central Railroad, south of Gordonsville, and to have defeated the
Confederates at Trevellion Station.</p>
<p>The attitude of General Sherman was not materially changed.</p>
<p>New Orleans advices say that the State of Arkansas is overrun with
guerrillas. The Federals, however, still hold Little Rock and Pine
Bluffs. General Banks was at New Orleans.</p>
<p>The Federal papers state that General Scott has just attained his
seventy-eighth year, and has also just completed the memoirs of his
life.</p>
<p>The bill repealing the Fugitive Slave Law was passed in the
Federal Senate by a vote of 24 against 7. This bill, having passed
both Houses, now simply awaits the President's signature.</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives the Loan Bill was passed. This
bill authorises Secretary Chase to borrow 400,000,000 dols. from time
to time upon six per cent bonds redeemable in five to forty years. The
interest payable in coin semi-annually.</p>
<p>A resolution had been offered in the Federal Senate requesting the
President to inform Congress whether the recruiting in Ireland and
Canada for the Federal army was authorised.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Convention of Maryland has abolished slavery in
that State by a large majority. The <hi rend="italic">New York
Tribune</hi> of June 25 announces the fact in the following
terms:--</p>
<q>Maryland has wheeled into line, and another undimmed star shines
out in the constellation of Free States. Her constitutional
Convention, in Session at Annapolis, passed yesterday the following
article of her Bill of Rights:--"Hereafter in this State there shall
be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except in punishment for
crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted; and all
persons held to service or labour as slaves are hereby declared
free. In every church in the land there ought to-morrow to be offered
solemn prayers of thanksgiving to God that to the people of that
State He has given grace, at length, to obey His mandate to 'Let the
oppressed go free.' A new prosperity will, in due season, follow that
obedience, and her children rejoice that the curse that has rested so
long upon her labour and hindered her growth is removed for ever.</q>
<p>Since the passing of the Gold Bill gold had gone up to 230, but
had declined again to 210. It stood at 219&#xBE; on the evening of
the 25th ult.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SURGEON OF THE<lb/> ALABAMA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. </hi>David Herbert Llewellyn, who was the
surgeon of the Confederate war-steamer Alabama during the two years of
her adventurous career, perished by drowning on Sunday, the 19th ult.,
sinking with his ship after her conflict with the Federal steamer
Kearsarge. He was the son of the Rev. David Llewellyn, Perpetual
Curate of Easton, near Pewsey, Wiltshire. He was educated at
Marlborough College, and studied for the medical profession, firstly
as an articled pupil of Dr. Hassall, at Richmond, and then, from 1856
to 1859, at Charing-cross Hospital, where he gained the silver medals
for surgery and chemistry. The last letter which Mr. Llewellyn ever
wrote was addressed to Mr. Travers, the resident medical officer of
Charing-cross Hospital, and is as follows:--" Cherbourg, June 14,
1864. Dear Travers,--Here we are. I send this by gentleman coming to
London. An enemy is outside. If she only stays long enough, we go out
and fight her. If I live, expect to see me in London shortly. If I
die, give my best love to all who know me. If M. A. de Caillet should
call on you, please show him every attention. I remain, dear Travers,
ever yours, <hi rend="smallcaps">D. H. Llewellyn.</hi>" Mr. Llewellyn
was much loved and respected by all on board. In the final struggle of
the Alabama, when the ship was sinking, the whale-boat and dingy, the
only two boats uninjured, were lowered, and the wounded placed in
them, Mr. Fullam being sent in charge of them to the Kearsarge. When
the boats were full, a man (unwounded) endeavoured to enter one, but
Mr. Llewellyn held him back. "See," said he, "I want to save my life
as much as you do; but let the wounded men be saved first." "Doctor,"
said the officer in the boat, "we can make room for you." "I will not
peril the wounded men," was his reply. He remained behind and sank
with the ship, an ever memorable instance of that chivalrous spirit
and devotion to duty which we are proud to believe characterise the
medical officers of the united services and the medical profession
generally in the United Kingdom. It is further gratifying to hear that
Llewellyn's fellow-students have appointed a committee to provide for
the erection of a tablet to his memory in Charing-cross Hospital,
where as a pupil he had so greatly distinguished himself, and that
another memorial is to be fixed in the church of Easton parish, where
he was born. The Portrait of him which we have engraved is from a
photograph taken at the Maison Rideau, Cherbourg, on the Thursday
before his death.</p></div2>

<p>...Another of England's many admirers, Mr. George Francis Train,
has turned up in New York lately from a visit to Abraham Lincoln, at
least so we construe the profanity "Fresh from Abraham's bosom." His
last resting-place has not allowed the effervescence of the London
champagne to subside; for the great author of "Spread Eagledom" is as
wild as ever. "England," he says, and his subject was chosen by his
audience, "is only a little province of France, and a revolution is
coming there. When the Fenian brotherhood rises and fires its guns on
the tops of the mountains," &#x0026;c. Silly brotherhood! why on the
tops of the mountains? Had they not better come down, and listen to
the good sense of Mr. Justice Keogh and those true friends who would
try to regenerate Ireland. The Roman Catholic clergy are beginning to
see that their interest lies also with the Government and the
prosperity of the people; and the best way of showing the true
character of the Fenians is to quote the approval of them by Mr. Train
and the Americans, who in their own battles invariably put the Irish
recruit "in the front."...</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE MAGAZINES.</p>
<p>...<hi rend="italic">Macmillan </hi>proffers a very good
number. The two most interesting contributions relate to America--one
a poem by Longfellow, full of melody and feeling; the other,
Mr. Dicey's slight memoir of his slight acquaintance with Nathaniel
Hawthorne. There is not much to communicate about this shyest of men,
yet Mr. Dicey has succeeded in touching the hermitage of the recluse
with a pencil of light which diminishes without dissipating its
natural obscurity. Hawthorne will never be thoroughly understood until
the American nation shall have had time to develop further examples of
a character not altogether new to it, though never before exhibited in
such completeness, or under circumstances of such interest. The
singular alliance of conscious superiority with morbid humility, of
strong common sense with absolute nullity in public life, of
vacillation almost ludicrous with perseverance and strength of will,
is not unparalleled in the States, and may be referred to the
conflicting influences of race and institutions on the one hand, and
of physical conditions on the other. The very slightness and
evanescence of Mr. Dicey's reminiscences impart to them the charm of
perfect keeping with their subject. </p>
<p>...Like <hi rend="italic">Macmillan, Blackwood</hi> is indebted for
its chief attraction to America--at least we do not think we err in
attributing the two lovely poems on Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper,"
to William Washington Story. It is now about six years since the great
sculptor published a volume of poems so saturated with the spirit of
Robert Browning as to deserve no better character than that of a
servile imitation, and to beget a seasonable fear that he would prove
incapable of excellence in original literary composition. These new
poems, however, retain just enough of the mannerism of Browning to
render evident their great superiority in clearness and symmetry. In
pith and masculine force they certainly fall short of Browning, yet
are not unworthy of a disciple. The subject is one on which a man of
Mr. Story's especial gifts deserves to be heard with reverence, a
feeling fully justified by his glowing and prophet-like proclamation
of inspiration from a higher source as the indispensable condition
of all success in art....</p></div2>

<p>There is no news of importance from Virginia. General Grant has
made no further attempt to turn the Confederate position at Petersburg
since his defeat on the 22nd ult.</p>
<p>Wilson's cavalry has destroyed twenty miles of the Danville
Railroad. On their return, on the night of the 27th ult., they were
intercepted by the Confederates at Beam's station, on the Weldon and
Petersburg Railroad. Wilson fought all night and the following
morning, but was unable to push his way through. Meade sent the sixth
corps, with a division of the second corps, to the assistance of
Wilson. On the 28th the Confederates were moving in the direction of
the rear of Grant's left.</p>
<p>A special despatch to the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>,
dated Washington, June 29, says:--</p>
<q><p>Latest advices from General Grant's head-quarters report only
such occasional skirmishing and artillery practice as inevitably
result from close proximity of the two forces. The chief enemies our
soldiers have had lately to combat are the heat and dust, which have
even been of the most malignant character. For thirty days not a drop
of rain has fallen, making a drought of a duration unparalleled in
that region for many years. It is with the utmost difficulty that men
and animals get even a scanty supply of water. General Palmer's raid
from Newbern, on the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad seems to supply a
perfect explanation of the recently-reported march of rebel troops
from Lee's army to North Carolina, on which such absurd speculations
have been based. General Hancock, yesterday morning, resumed command
of the Second Army Corps. On Friday last Acting Master Street, of the
flotilla, obtained information that there were a number of guerrillas
on the peninsula engaged in making torpedoes, and accordingly on that
night he landed with thirty men and proceeded over the country some
ten miles, capturing six persons, among whom was a Confederate captain
and physician, whom he brought off to his vessel.</p></q>
<p>A telegram dated head-quarters of the army of the Potomac, June 28,
five a.m., says:--</p>
<q><p>All remains quiet at the front. Our left wing swung round and
took possession of the Weldon Railroad, about four miles from the
city, without opposition. It is believed the enemy's lines have been
somewhat contracted since Friday last, and the opinion prevails that a
force has been sent to meet and drive back General Hunter.</p></q>
<p>Another despatch, dated the 28th of June, noon, says:--</p>
<q><p>A severe engagement took place on Saturday between our cavalry
and a force of the enemy, consisting of cavalry and mounted infantry,
at the Chickahominy river. The enemy had followed Sheridan from the
White House, in the expectation of being able to cut off part of his
waggon-train, which was very large, and it was here they made their
attack. Jorbet's division was detailed to protect the train, while
Gregg's division was placed in position to resist an attack from the
enemy on the roads which they were known to occupy. At an early hour
skirmishing commenced, and was kept up until noon, when the
Confederate infantry, which had been dismounted, made a desperate
charge on our lines; and although our men dismounted and fought them
gallantly for a time, they were finally compelled to retire, suffering
considerably. Our loss is supposed to be about 1500. Our men fell back
to their supports near the bridge, and the command, with the entire
train, subsequently got over it without further loss. The enemy made
no effort to follow us up, and it is thought they must have suffered
severely. The whole command has arrived at the James River, and will
be across by to-night. There are now about 5000 sick and wounded in
hospital at City Point, and they suffer much from the heat and from a
lack of good water. The members of the different aid societies are
fast giving out from exhaustion and fever, and many of them have been
forced to give up their labours and return home.</p></q>
<p>General Sherman has been repulsed in Georgia with heavy loss. He
reports that two columns of his army, under Macpherson and Thomas,
simultaneously attacked the Confederates at Kenesaw Mountains [i.e.,
Kennesaw Mountain] on the
27th, and were repulsed. He admits Thomas's loss at 2000 and
Macpherson's at 500, among whom were General Harker and four
Colonels. Confederate despatches state the Federal loss at
4500. Sherman believes the Confederate loss to have been light, they
being protected by breastworks. According to a late rumour, General
Sherman was retreating for want of supplies and forage. The
Confederate General Pillow had been operating on Sherman's rear, and
had attacked the town of Lafayette, but was defeated.</p>
<p>General Hunter has been obliged to retreat into Western
Virginia. Mr. Stanton announces that Hunter, finding his ammunition
running short, was retreating to Western Virginia, but reports the
complete success of his expedition to Lynchburg. According to
Hunter's report, he has destroyed much Confederate property and
supplies, and beat the enemy in every engagement. Confederate
despatches of the 25th ult., however, state that the Confederates were
pursuing Hunter, and had attacked him several times, captured thirteen
of his cannon, and inflicted heavy loss upon him in killed, wounded,
and prisoners.</p>
<p>Mr. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, has resigned, and Mr. Lincoln
nominated as his successor ex-Governor Todd, of Ohio, who having
declined the appointment, Senator Fessenden, of Maine, was appointed,
and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>President Lincoln, in reply to a resolution of the United States'
Senate, had sent in a communication from the Secretary of State, from
which it appears that no authority has been given by the Executive of
the Federal Government, or by any executive department, to anyone,
either in the United States or elsewhere, to obtain recruits either
in Ireland or Canada, or in any foreign country, for either the army
or the navy of the United States; and, on the contrary, that whenever
application for such authority has been made, it has been refused and
absolutely withheld.</p>
<p>The following is President Lincoln's letter accepting the
nomination for the Presidency:--</p>
<q><p rend="right">Executive Mansion, Washington, June 27, 1864.</p>
<p>Gentlemen,--Your letter of the 14th inst., formally notifying me
that I have been nominated by the Convention you represent for the
presidency of the United States for four years from the 4th of March
next has been received. The nomination is gratefully accepted, as the
resolutions of the Convention called the platform are heartily
approved. While the resolution in regard to the supplanting of
Republican government upon the western continent is fully concurred
in, there might be misunderstanding were I not to say that the
position of the Government in relation to the action of France in
Mexico, as assumed through the State Department and endorsed by the
Convention among the measures and acts of the Executive, will be
faithfully maintained so long as the state of facts shall leave that
position permanent and applicable. I am especially gratified that the
soldier and the seaman were not forgotten by the Convention, as they
for ever must and will be remembered by the grateful country for whose
salvation they devote their lives. Thanking you for the kind and the
complimentary terms in which you have communicated the nomination and
other proceedings of the Convention, I subscribe myself your obedient
servant, <hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="right">Abraham Lincoln</hi></hi>.</p></q>
<p>Congress has repealed the Gold Bill.</p>
<p>In Congress, on the 29th ult., a joint resolution, on the motion of
Mr. Harlan, of Iowa, was adopted, that the President of the United
States be requested to appoint a day for humiliation and prayer by the
people of the United States, to confess and to repent of their
manifold sins, to implore the compassion and forgiveness of the
Almighty "that, if consistent with his will, the existing rebellion
may be speedily suppressed, and the supremacy of the Constitution and
laws of the United States established throughout all the States."</p>
<p>In the Senate, on the 25th ult., the report of the Conference
Committee, appointed to adjust the disagreements of the two Houses on
the Internal Revenue Bill, was submitted and adopted. As the report
was also concurred in by the House of Representatives, the bill now
only needs the President's signature to become law. As now finally
fixed upon, the tax on whisky will be one dollar and a half per
gallon after the 1st of July till the 1st of February next, after
which it will be two dollars per gallon. On incomes the tax is 5 per
cent on all over 600 dols. and not exceeding 5000 dols.; on incomes
from 5000 dols. to 10,000 dols., 7&#xBD; per cent; exceeding 10,000
dollars, 10 per cent.</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives the session was an excited one. The
bill amendatory of the Enrolment Act was taken up. The principal point
at issue was the proposition to repeal the 300 dollars commutation
clause. The debate was a very animated one, and at times<pb n="51"/>
became very personal and bitter. Mr. Fernando Wood, of New York, made
a speech denouncing the war and insisting that it should be
immediately stopped. He became so violent in his remarks that he was
hissed by the members.</p>
<p>Gold opened at 250, rose to 282, but declined to 260 on
Mr. Fessenden's confirmation to the secretaryship of the Treasury, and
to 230 on the repeal of the Gold Bill by the Senate.</p>
<p>It appears that General Bishop Polk was killed in battle in Georgia
on the 14th ult. The Bishop graduated at the West Point military
seminary in 1827, but Bishop M'Ilvaine, who was then Chaplain at that
place, persuaded him to enter the Church, and he afterwards became
Bishop of Louisiana. He inherited a good estate, with many slaves, and
his ideas were always intensely Southern. When the present war broke
out he entered the Confederate army, and was made a
Brigadier-General. He never resigned his bishopric, probably intending
at the close of the war to resume his spiritual functions.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph F. Scoville, the well-known correspondent ("Manhattan")
of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, died suddenly in New York on the morning of
the 25th ult. of inflammation of the lungs. He had been summoned
recently before General Dix to answer for some of his statements in
his letters, and received a warning. He was in the fiftieth year of
his age.</p>
<p>Three hundred Swedish and Norwegian emigrants arrived in Chicago on
Sunday morning by the Michigan Southern Railroad. One portion of them
will go into Missouri, the other portion left for Minnesota.</p>
<p>The heat in New York had been intense. On the afternoon of the 25th
ult. the mercury mounted to 97 deg. in the shade. Several cases of
sunstroke had occurred.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RUNNING THE BLOCKADE INTO THE PORT OF<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We </hi>have received from our Special Artist,
who, after a short interval of repose in England, has returned to the
seat of war in America and safely arrived at the camp of General Lee,
a Sketch of the scene on board the blockade-running steamer Lilian as
she entered the port of Wilmington, in the Confederate States, passing
unharmed the squadron of Federal cruisers, on the morning of June
4. The special correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, who
was a passenger on board the same vessel, has contributed to that
journal a narrative of the run from Bermuda to Wilmington, which may
be quoted as a commentary on the Illustration we have engraved:--</p>
<p>"Upon the evening of Wednesday, the 1st of June, the Lilian and the
Florie, two of the fleetest and most beautiful of the blockade-defying
vessels, started simultaneously from Bermuda upon the first trip
inward which either had ever made. Both belong to the same company,
but there is an emulation between the two rival vessels which is not
satisfactorily allayed by their experiences hitherto, but which waits
the solution of further trial. The weather was lovely, the sea like a
milldam, and favourable beyond expression to light draught and
gossamer craft, such as are these blockade-runners, which lightly
scratch the surface instead of clutching the ribs of old ocean, and
which in summer seas have no more to fear from heavy seagoing craft,
like the Rhode Island or the Vanderbilt, than has the Irish
might-express from the lumbering freight-train which leaves
Euston-square five minutes in its rear. Rarely have two more
attractive prizes slipped through the meshes of the blockade than the
two vessels of which I am writing. It is not alone that they would be
invaluable with a view to their conversion into Federal cruisers, or
that two of the most valuable cargoes which have yet reached
Wilmington await at this instant the disposal of the Confederate
Government, but that on board both vessels were Confederate
'malignants,' whose capture would have been a sweet morsel to many a
craving palate in Washington and Boston. To many an English reader the
name of Captain Maffit, lately in command of the Confederate cruiser
Florida, is well known as having assisted Captain Semmes and the
Alabama to
demonstrate that two light, and, as regards equipment, comparatively
insignificant vessels of war would have little difficulty in driving
from the ocean a flag which, three years ago, might have been seen
upon every wave of every sea.</p>
<p>"My experience on board the Lilian leads me to anticipate for
Captain Maffit and his vessel--a credit to her builders,
Messrs. Thompson, of Glasgow--a long and prosperous career. An
incident which occurred 200 miles from Wilmington, in a portion of the
ocean which is constantly swept by Federal cruisers, seems worthy of
record. Upon our port bow was descried a sail enveloped in a dense
canopy of smoke. Time was ineffably precious--there was every reason
to suspect Yankee guile, which is said to be nowhere more fertilely
exhibited than in their conduct of the blockade; but it was deemed
possible, after careful scrutiny, that the vessel might be on
fire. Briefly remarking, 'The ship which leaves a companion at sea in
distress must be accursed,' Captain Maffit ordered our course to be
altered, and bore down upon the stranger. It soon became evident that
she was a Federal cruiser, making a dense white smoke with her
Cumberland coal, and beating rapidly eastward in apparent pursuit of
another delinquent. The helm was rapidly changed, and our course
resumed. Dark and inscrutable came on the noon, defying all
possibility of an observation. It was believed that ere the morrow's
dawn should break we might reach Wilmington, and onward we
pressed. The night wore rapidly away; two o'clock, three o'clock, half
past three o'clock in the morning came, but by no eye peering through
the thick gloom could the looked-for light at Fort Fisher be
discerned. Then, as the morning dawned, we prepared to lay-to for the
day, between the outer and inner cordon of the blockaders. It was
hardly to be expected that we should escape for sixteen hours
unobserved; but it was a signal instance of good luck that from four
in the morning till half-past one p. m., we were unmolested. Then the
tall masts of a large Federal cruiser, and her immense paddle-wheels
and lofty black hull were visible, and for the first time, as our
antagonist approached us from the direction of Wilmington, the 'airy
fairy Lilian' prepared to give us assurance of that speed which we all
felt she possessed. Some slight delay there was before steam could be
fully got up, and for some twenty minutes our pursuer seemed to gain
upon us. But as the pressure of steam ascended from fifteen pounds to
twenty, from twenty to twenty-three, from twenty-three to twenty-six,
and as the revolutions of the paddle mounted from twenty-six to
twenty-eight, from twenty-eight to thirty-three per minute, the Lilian
flew out to sea swift as arrow from a bow. In little more than two
hours the hull of our pursuer was invisible, and her topgallant sails
a speck upon the distant horizon. But as she still lay between us and
Wilmington it became necessary to run round her. This also the
light-heeled Lilian had little difficulty in accomplishing; but as the
sun dropped into the sea, and our pursuer, although distant, still
hung upon our rear, we found that, reckoning little the speed of our
advance, we had sighted the inside blockade squadron before the close
of day. There was nothing for it but to persevere, and fortunately,
before we approached close to land, darkness had completely set
in. Silently and with bated breath we passed cruiser after cruiser,
distinctly visible to every eye, and suggesting the flashing out of a
blue or Drummond light, and the rush of grape-shot and shrapnel
through our rigging and bulwarks. But it was not destined that upon
this occasion the Lilian should receive her baptism of fire. Just as
we approach Fort Fisher a dark spot is seen on the bar. It is a
Federal launch, seen by us too late for Captain Maffit to indulge the
anxious wish of his heart and to run her down. We pass her within
twenty yards, and again the expected volley of musketry is
wanting. Another moment and we are under the mound upon which stands
the fort, and eagerly questioned for news. 'The news is good all
round.' 'Three times three for General Johnston;' 'six times six for
General Lee;' and in mirth and laughter and song the night wears
away. Three hours after us comes the Florie, and is heavily fired at
as she wears inwards. But morning finds both vessels and their cargoes
safe at their wharf in Wilmington, nor is it rash to predict for them
both the probability of many returns. At least it may safely be
augured that it will take no ordinary amount of speed and courage to
circumvent so fearless and experienced a sailor as Captain Maffitt,
and that in his new career his skill and success will be not inferior
to those which he exhibited in his old.</p>
<p>"As an illustration of the facility and certainty with which the
blockade is now defied, I will mention, in conclusion, a few
facts. Between the 1st of May and the 1st of June no less than
twenty-four vessels made the port of Wilmington safely, without
disaster befalling a single vessel. No wonder that piles upon piles of
Government goods are stored here, awaiting, when there is less strain
upon the railroads, transportation to Richmond and Atlanta. I am
informed by the Government agent here that in his whole experience he
has never lost a single outward-bound letter. A gentleman at Bermuda,
the agent of an eminent English firm, told me that during two years he
had sent an average of three mails per month from Bermuda and Nassau
into Secessia, and that in the whole time only two mails had been
lost."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">RICHMOND</hi>.--The city of Richmond, by the
last census, had a population of 38,000 souls, but the great influx of
civil and military officers and refugees from other parts of the State
has probably raised it to a much higher figure. It is situated at the
head of tide-water, at the lower falls of James River, about 150 miles
from its mouth. The city occupies a most picturesque situation, being
built on Richmond and Shockhoe hills, which are separated by Shockhoe
Creek and surrounded by beautiful scenery. It is regularly laid out
and well built, the streets, which are lighted with gas, crossing each
other at right angles. On Shockhoe-hill are the State Capitol and
other public buildings. The Capitol is an imposing edifice, and
contains, in its central hall, Houden's celebrated statue of
Washington. On the east of the square is the Governor's
mansion. Jefferson Davis's residence is a private mansion, which was
purchased for him by the Confederate Government. The city has many
fine public buildings, six banks, thirteen newspapers, and
twenty-three churches. In one of the three Presbyterian churches
Jefferson Davis worships. The falls of James River afford immense
water-power, and there are very extensive factories, including four
cotton and about fifty tobacco factories, flour mills, rolling mills,
forges, furnaces, machine shops, &#x0026;c., the latter of which, and
particularly the Tredegar Ironworks, have been of immense service to
the rebels in turning out ordnance and material of war. The annual
exports of Richmond before the rebellion reached nearly 7,000,000
dols. and its imports 750,000 dols. But since it had the honour of
being the rebel capital its foreign commerce has been
extinguished. Vessels or gun-boats drawing ten feet can ascend to
within a mile of the city, at a place called the Rockets. Vessels of
fifteen feet draught ascend to Warwick, three miles below. A canal has
been built around the falls, and above them there is navigation for
200 miles. The James River and Kanawha Canal, intended to extend to
Covington, is completed for 200 miles. Richmond has very extensive
railroad communications, being the terminus of five roads, running to
Fredericksburg and the Potomac, to West Point and the York River,
Petersburg and Norfolk, to Danville, Virginia, to Jackson's River, by
the Central Railroad, and from these the connections lead all through
the Southern States. Opposite the city are the two towns of Spring
Hill and Manchester. Richmond was founded in 1742, became the capital
of the State of Virginia in 1779, and in June, 1861, it was made the
seat of Government of the "Confederate States of America," whose
Congress assembled there on July 20. Its history since then is only
too familiar to the country. Around the city are various hills,
extending a great distance, on the most important of which
fortifications were erected in the days of the "On to Richmond"
cry.--<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...In America, History notes not so much the failure of Grant's
expedition and the struggle for the presidency as the first
influential cry for a further division of the once great
Republic. Colonel Anderson, brother to Major Anderson, who defended
Fort Sumter, writes a letter full of Americanisms and plain
sense. "Rampant war has yoked her red dragons to her iron car, and all
humanity is trampled under foot. Our generals blush behind the buckler
of Mars, and that she-devil Bellona lights us on. I am for peace; for
a total and immediate cessation of war. I am tired of Yankee
taskmasters; I hate their selfish meanness. Let us have a Western
Confederacy!" Elsewhere Colonel Anderson wishes to follow "the bright
sparkling waters of the Ohio, down to the father of the waters--down
to the ocean of peace;" adding, "The original Union is dissolved; no
man is fool enough to doubt it. The Union is dissolved." Now, although
this may remind one of Elijah Pogram, and the bright home of the
American eagle being in the settin' sun, still it is a great sign of
the times. Many men must think with this honest gentleman, and, if so,
the beginning of the end, although a long end, perhaps, of the
American war has commenced....</p>
<p>Two celebrated personages--one being an abstraction--may be placed
in the obituary. The abstraction is <hi rend="italic">The Owl</hi>,
which, after No. 1006 (it began at No. 1001), ceases to be. It
contained early information of marriages, and picked up the whispers
of the Foreign Office. The other is "Manhattan," the New York
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, a writer who
always amused, but never instructed. He held a dashing pen, which many
will miss; he overthrew alike propriety and grammar; and his vivid
pictures were like those figures which pass before a concave
mirror--you saw them plainly enough, but the next moment forgot
them. Peace be to his ashes! A rabid Northerner at one time, he had
honestly thought himself round to General Scott's opinion, and wanted
to let the "wayward sisters go in peace."</p></div2>

<p>The Confederates are not acting wholly on the defensive. An
advance--by some termed an invasion, by others a raid for horses,
forage, and other plunder, but at all events an advance--has been made
into Maryland by a Confederate force. Our information respecting this
movement is confused and conflicting; and all that can he safely said
is that a body of Southern troops, estimated by Mr. Lincoln at from
15,000 to 20,000 (according to other accounts 30,000) strong, and
represented to be led by General Ewell, had taken possession of
Harper's Ferry and Hagerstown in Maryland, throwing out in various
directions what are described as marauding parties. No opposition
appears to have been offered to the progress of the invading column,
which must have slipped quietly along the Shenandoah Valley until it
reached Martinsburg, which was occupied by General Siegel. At this
point some severe fighting took place, but the Federals were obliged
to fall back to Harper's Ferry, which they in turn evacuated,
apparently without striking a blow for its defence. General Siegel
retired to Maryland Heights, and the Confederates are reported to have
been preparing to attack that position. Our present advices throw as
little light upon the subject as upon the strength of this expedition;
but Mr. Lincoln had called upon the States of New York, Pennsylvania,
and Massachusetts to send about 30,000 militia into the field to meet
this unexpected movement on the part of the Confederates. General
Hunter is moving northwards to attack the invaders. Great alarm, it is
said, was felt along the Pennsylvanian border respecting the position
of General Hunter, to whose force the people of the North had been
looking for protection against the Confederate invasion. A New York
telegram of the 8th stated that Hunter had reached Parkersburg, and
that he was hurrying on to Maryland. A telegram dated the 9th affirms,
on the other hand, that the latest accounts from that officer's
command left him at Charlestown, with his army dispirited and weakened
by long marches. Governor Seymour is said to have instructed the
General commanding the militia of New York not to allow any of his men
to leave the State for Washington until further orders.</p>
<p>From the neighbourhood of Petersburg there is no news of
importance, although it was expected that General Grant was nearly
ready for another demonstration. General Smith on the 30th ult. made
an attempt on one of the Confederate works; but owing, it is stated, to
a misunderstanding of his orders, the troops were so disposed that the
enemy's artillery cut them up and they were obliged to retire. Next
day the Confederates made an attack on a position where the Federals
were planting a new battery, but they were repulsed with great
loss. General Wilson had succeeded in rejoining the army of the
Potomac, but with the loss of a considerable number of men and twelve
pieces of artillery. He is said to have destroyed sixty miles of the
Danville Railway.</p>
<p>Turning to the campaign in Georgia, we find that General Johnston
evacuated Kenesaw [i.e., Kennesaw] Mountain and Marietta on the 3rd, and that General
Sherman was following him.</p>
<p>At New York the dispute between the Federal and the State
authorities was not closed. The President, it is said, had ordered
General Dix to disregard the civil actions against him in respect of
the seizure of the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Commerce</hi>. Governor Seymour, on the other
hand, was reported to be resolved on enforcing the civil actions and
ordering General Dix's arrest. The Governor had called for 75,000
additional militia, probably to secure the State against any possible
attack of the Confederates.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has appointed the 8th of August for a day of
humiliation and prayer.</p>
<p>Martial law has been proclaimed and the Habeas Corpus Act suspended
in Kentucky.</p>
<p>On the 3rd inst. died, at the venerable age of ninety-three, the
Hon. Josiah Quincy, of Boston, Massachusetts, a distinguished
statesman, a true patriot, born a British subject, five years older
than the Declaration of Independence, which his countrymen celebrated

previously visited Petersburg, and who, passing uninterruptedly into
the Federal territory, accomplished the journey between Richmond and
Queenstown in the remarkably short time of sixteen days, gives the
following particulars of the military situation in and around the
Confederate capital:--</p>
<q><p>The troops detached by way of the Shenandoah Valley towards
Maryland consisted of the whole of Ewell's corps (late Stonewall
Jackson's) under the personal command of that General, and numbered
25,000 men.</p>
<p>It was believed that another smaller detachment, with heavy
artillery, would be or had already been directed towards Acquia Creek,
with a view of creating powerful batteries on the Potomac, blockading
that river, and thus interrupting the water communication with
Washington, at the same time that Ewell's corps would destroy the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and thus cut the main line of
communication with the capital.</p>
<p>Ewell's force was considered amply strong enough to cope with any
troops which the North in its present denuded condition could oppose
to it, and it was believed that as soon as the offensive movement of
the Confederates became developed in its true proportions the Federal
Government would <sic corr="recall">recal</sic> Grant's whole army. No corps of observation
which Grant might leave behind on embarking could hold its ground
against a combined land and naval attack from Richmond.</p>
<p>Nearly 3000 prisoners had been brought in from Wilson's corps, so
that his entire loss could not be less than between 4000 and 5000. He
had lost all his artillery trains and stores; in fact, only just
escaped total destruction. About twenty miles of the track of the
Danville Railroad was destroyed by him; but as there are no important
bridges on that portion of the track, the "Corps of Constructions"--a
corps of railway engineers and labourers specially formed for such
purposes--would be able to repair the damage in less than two
weeks.</p>
<p>The balance of prisoners in favour of the Confederates during the
Virginia campaign alone was estimated at no less than 10,000. A great
portion of the prisoners are stragglers, who voluntarily came into the
Confederate lines and surrendered themselves. They report that in
Grant's army so frequent had become the practice of self-mutilation,
generally by shooting or cutting off a finger, that an order has been
issued severely punishing the men as soon as their self-made wounds
are healed, and then sending them as labourers under guard into the
trenches. Besides malarious fevers, very malignant bowel complaints,
caused by the bad water and the pulverised sand with which the
atmosphere is surcharged, had appeared, and threatened to become
epidemic in the Federal army.</p>
<p>Grant was leisurely shelling Petersburg at a distance of about two
miles, but doing little damage. Communications between that city and
Richmond were perfect and not in the least disturbed. No scarcity was
apprehended of provisions. The army was healthy and in excellent
spirits. At no time had the Confederates been more sanguine. It was
generally considered that General Lee was indisputably master of the
situation and that the war could not be prolonged much beyond the
present campaign.</p>
<p>There was no distress, but also no excitement, in Richmond. A
solemn earnestness and calm confidence pervaded all classes. The
theatres had been closed. The churches were constantly open for
prayer, and thronged day and night with soldiers and civilians. The
houses of the wealthier citizens were so many open private hospitals,
and the ladies unremitting in their care of the sick and
wounded. Mr. Davis's health was good. Foreign exchange had fallen to
1500, but was little in demand. The prices of most commodities had
declined, owing to the gradual absorption of the redundant currency by
taxes and the funding system.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress, previous to its adjournment on the 14th
ult., had, in view of the contemplated offensive movements, issued a
manifesto, chiefly, though not in express terms, addressed to the
people of the North. In this the earnest desire of the Confederate
States for peace is set forth in eloquent language; the war is
declared to be one only of self-preservation, and all intentions of
conquest or of impeding the happiness and development of the Northern
States is most distinctly disclaimed.</p></q></div2>

<p>A Baltimore paper says:--"Our harbour has been on fire for the last
twenty-four hours: literally on fire. The surface of the water for
thousands of square yards has been a perfect flame, caused by the
destruction of the Italian ship Juliana, which took fire whilst lying
at the wharf and loading with petroleum. She had on board 1800
barrels, and had to be towed over to the opposite side of the basin to
save the surrounding property. As the barrels burst, the oil spread
over the water in a flame."</p>

<p>A New York paper relates the following singular occurrence at the
scene of war. A sergeant had been engaged placing upon a number of
headboards the names of members of his regiment who had been killed in
the late fight. There was one board in excess, and in a sportive vein
he placed with a lead-pencil his own name upon it, and the date of his
demise, June 20, as his term of service had then expired and he was
about to leave for home. A day or two after, while bidding his
companions farewell, he was struck on the breast by a 20-pounder
Parrott, and instantly killed. The very headboard he had unthinkingly
inscribed with his own name was placed ever his grave, which, with
date, correctly marks his resting-place.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...A trial between two publishers reveals an unwholesome feeling
amongst the gentlemen engaged in that trade. Burly Sam Johnson, who
hated <hi rend="italic">his </hi>publishers with a reason, has a
burlesque line which will here apply:--</p>
<p rend="center">Who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.</p>
<p>Messrs. Sampson Low, Son, and Marston buy an American book,
probably, <hi rend="italic">more Americano</hi>, rubbish. Nevertheless,
it is theirs, and they fairly advertise to the world the fact. Another
publisher receives an American copy of the work, and forthwith issues
the book at an eighth of the first publisher's price. Hence an
injunction, and, of course, irritated feelings; and, through the
stupidity of the lawyers engaged, the case breaks down, again to be
taken up, however. "Haunted Hearts" is the name of the prize for which
these gentlemen contend. Would not all hearts have been more at ease
if publishers made a compact not to touch books which others have
announced, and, while the Americans deny us the right of copyright, to
encourage English authors and leave Yankee rubbish over the water?</p>
<p>It is cheering to find that we have those amongst us who yet
believe in the possibility of mediating in America. A deputation of
gentlemen, with whom were Admiral Anson and Mr. James Spence (the "S"
of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>), waited on Lord Palmerston to
urge the propriety of such a step. The jaunty Minister quoted a
Hudibrastic couplet about the common result of interposing in
quarrels, and said that, although England was not afraid of the
"bloody nose" therein promised, still the time of mediation was not
yet come. Surely, a message from over the sea by the Queen herself, or
a letter in her own Royal hand expressive of her own and her people's
sorrow at the excessive destruction of human life, would not meet with
insult, and might form a basis for the peace party in America to work
upon. There is nothing so heartless as red tape; could we not in this
extremity do without it?</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PETROLEUM OIL-FIELDS AT FRANKLIN,<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">PENNSYLVANIA.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In </hi>this Number of our Journal will be
found a couple of Illustrations of the locality of the petroleum
oil-springs at Franklin, in the State of Pennsylvania, that wonderful
natural production which has lately given rise to a most lucrative
commerce. The qualities of petroleum, or mineral oil, are, indeed, by
no means a modern discovery, and its existence in many parts of the
globe, especially in some countries of Asia, has been proved by the
instances of spontaneous combustion which many ancient historians have
recorded. In the island of Trinidad, in the State of Virginia, and at
Enniskillen, in Western Canada, there is abundance of this valuable
product; but for a long time no efforts were made to obtain it for the
use of mankind. It was not till 1857 that operations were commenced
for the distillation of the bitumen at Enniskillen, and the operators
then speedily discovered that by sinking wells a similar material
might be obtained in a fluid state. Large quantities of oil were thus
procured. Two years later a well was sunk to the depth of seventy
feet, in Venango County, Pennsylvania. The oil flowed with such force
that for many weeks 1000 gallons per day were obtained from this
well. Other wells were speedily sunk, many of which yielded large
quantities of oil. In some districts the earth is saturated with the
oil, and, occasionally, a porous sandstone or limestone will yield
considerable quantities. More commonly, however, the oil is collected
in fissures in the rocks, at various depths below the surface. In some
cases an ample supply of oil is obtained at a depth of 40 ft., while
other wells are sunk as low as 120 ft. to 160 ft. deep. At Titusville,
Pennsylvania, there are wells of the depth of 590 ft. Usually, when
the oil is reached, the pressure of the gas in the fissure forces it
up, and it flows for some time to the surface. As soon as the oil has
ceased flowing, a pump is employed. Sometimes the oil continues to
flow spontaneously, and with such force as to defy every effort to
control it. The quantity of oil yielded by the wells varies, however,
considerably, some wells producing only ten barrels per day, and
others as much as 300 barrels.</p>
<p>The apparatus to be seen at Oil Creek is of a simple description,
consisting of large wooden cisterns sunk in the ground to receive the
oil which rises through tubes let down into the borings. It is then
drawn from the cisterns and put into barrels for exportation. The
cisterns are covered, to prevent evaporation, and their leaking is
ingeniously prevented by surrounding them with a trench full of water,
as the greater specific gravity of the water forbids the oil to escape
through it. The casks or barrels of crude oil are conveyed from the
Franklin and Titusville stations by the Atlantic and Great Western
Railway--a branch of which, fifty-four miles in length, has lately
been constructed for this traffic. The Atlantic and Great Western is a
line of 400 miles, to Salamanca, on the New York and Erie line,
connecting the great town of Cincinnati, and that of St. Louis, still
farther west, with the port of Cleveland on Lake Erie and with the
railway to New York, by which an immense export trade in grain and
salt meat is carried on. This important means of communication between
the most productive region of the western continent and the Atlantic
seaboard was formed by a company of which Mr. James M'Henry, of
London, and Senor Salamanca, the well-known Spanish capitalist, are
the chief promoters. They began their work in the spring of 1862,
taking five thousand English "navvies" to America for the
purpose. They obtained the requisite funds by mortgaging the first
section of the line when completed, allowing 7 per cent interest on
their debentures, and relying upon the high profits which a railway
passing through this district--the gateway of the north-western
States--was certain to yield. Their operations have been effected with
extraordinary rapidity and success, notwithstanding the civil war. Two
hundred miles of railway were constructed in as many days before the
end of 1862, and 145 miles were added in the course of 1863. The line
is now opened throughout its entire length, traversing the fertile
States of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and enabling goods or passengers to
travel from New York to St. Louis, near the confluence of the
Mississippi and Missouri, without a change of carriage. The corn of
the Western States, the coal and iron of Pennsylvania, and probably,
when peace shall be restored, some of the cotton of the South, will by
this means find its way, along with the petroleum oil from Franklin
and other stations, to the main outlet of American maritime
commerce. The Oil Creek branch alone has just paid a dividend of 25
per cent on its first year's working. The New York and Erie, and the
Ohio and Mississippi lines, by the completion of the Atlantic and
Great Western, which links them to each other, have greatly increased
their traffic. For the readier conveyance of the petroleum oil to the
railway stations in the oil-producing district, the company is now
laying down iron pipes, through which the oil will be forced from the
tanks at the wells by powerful steam-pumps. These parts of the
apparatus cannot, of course, be shown in our Engraving. During the
past year the Atlantic and Great Western Railway has carried more than
half a million barrels of petroleum oil, which is not one third of the
product of this wonderful region.</p>
<p>The petroleum oil is sent from America in a crude state, just as it
pours out of the earth. The business of refining and preparing it for
use is extensively carried on in England and France. The London
Hydrocarbon Oil Company, in their manufacturing establishment at
Southall, apply to the American oil a patent process of distillation,
by which the pure transparent liquid known as <hi rend="italic">cazeline</hi>, giving, a most beautiful light, is
disengaged from the grosser elements of the petroleum, as well as from
the spirituous part, which yields an explosive gas. The latter
substance is largely employed instead of turpentine for various
manufacturing purposes, while the cazeline is burned, without the
slightest danger, in the lamps on our drawing-room tables, free from
smoke and smell. Nor are these the only uses of the petroleum
oil. Experiments have lately been made, by order of the French
Government, to test its value as fuel for the engines of their steam
navy. It has been proved that a given quantity of this substance will
generate, in half the time, as much steam as could be produced by
burning twice the weight of coal. It seems likely that the
introduction of this portable fuel will have a great effect upon the
development of steam navigation. The Southall works alone can refine fifty
thousand barrels yearly.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>The raid into Maryland has been brought to a close, and the
Confederate forces have recrossed the Potomac, carrying with them
immense quantities of plunder. On the 9th inst., the Confederates had
reached a position midway between Baltimore and Washington, and were
threatening both towns. An engagement took place with a strong Federal
force under the command of General Wallace, in which the latter was
defeated and forced to retire on Baltimore. Several of the bridges on
the railroad connecting that town with Washington were destroyed, the
telegraph-wires cut, and two trains captured, one of which contained a
general officer and his Staff. Having approached Baltimore
sufficiently close to burn the residence of the Governor of Maryland,
which stood within four miles of that town, the invaders turned
southward and made their appearance in the northern environs of
Washington. A demonstration was made against one of the outlying
forts. But on the 14th inst. the invading force withdrew from before
Washington and recrossed the Potomac, carrying with it enormous stores
and a large number of horses. Such, briefly told, are the events which
took place in Maryland between the 9th and 14th inst. The Federals,
who, it is stated, have been reinforced by the arrival of two
divisions from General Grant's army, were reported to have also
crossed the Potomac at Edward's Ferry, in pursuit.</p>
<p>The Governor of Pennsylvania had earnestly appealed to the people
to volunteer for short service, and rather reproaches the
Philadelphians for not displaying more alacrity in responding to his
first call.</p>
<p>One of the correspondents of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> was in the train from Baltimore to Philadelphia, which was
captured by the Confederates. He says:--</p>
<q><p>At forty minutes past nine the express train to New York started
with passengers, your correspondent among the number. We reached
Gunpowder river all safe, and immediately after passing the long
trestle bridge, speed was increased. About two miles from the bridge,
at Magnolia station, two or three pistol-shots were heard, when the
train suddenly stopped, and a cry was raised, "The rebels are on us."
But a few seconds elapsed before they entered the cars, carrying
pistols in their hands. The first question asked was, "Are there any
ladies in this car?" On being answered in the affirmative they ordered
every lady to sit down. This was immediately followed by another order
to "Clear out." It was while leaving the car that purses and watches
were taken from the passengers. The request to hand them over was
enforced by a cocked pistol held at the heads of the victimised
passengers. The prisoners were then placed under a strong guard, and
the cars set on fire, after the baggage and express cars had been
emptied. Steam was then got up, the engine reversed, and the train of
blazing cars run down to Gunpowder Bridge. A column of dense black
smoke was soon seen rising in the direction of the bridge, and when
the rebels who had been in charge of the bridge returned they said the
bridge was burning finely, and would be totally
consumed. Major-General Franklin was a passenger on board the first
train. He was dressed in citizen's clothes, and when the rebels
entered the car and asked him who he was, he replied, "Nobody of any
account." The guard passed on a few yards, when a Baltimore lady (of
whom there were a number on board) told him the General's rank and
name. The guard returned and demanded his papers, which were of course
handed over, and the General was taken from the car.</p></q>
<p>This correspondent notes the significant fact that a large number
of the invaders were Marylanders themselves, and knew not only the
country but the people. He says:--</p>
<q><p>They were under the command of Major Harry Gilmore, and
consisted of twenty-five men belonging to the 1st Regiment Maryland
Cavalry, and the balance belonging to the 2nd Maryland, Major
Gilmore's own regiment. From their conversation I learned that the
majority were residents of Maryland. They were armed with pistols,
carbines, and sabres. The lady prisoners were remarkably well treated
by the rebels, and it was somewhat amusing when the train was stopped
to see the rebel horsemen ride up to the car windows, where they were
greeted somewhat as follows:--"Why, Tom, is that you?" "How are you,
Harry?" "Oh! come inside." Small white hands were grasped by the brown
hard ones of the troopers and warmly shaken. Many of them dismounted,
and, on entering the car, were very affectionately kissed by their lady
friends. It appeared to be quite a joyful meeting. The other prisoners
were treated very well, with the exception of being obliged to give up
whatever any of their captors fancied he would like to possess. One
gentlemen--a doctor, I believe--was compelled to draw off his boots
and exchange them for a pair of dusty cowhide riding-boots, or rather
leggings, as they were minus the soles. A rebel fancied my hat, and
took it, with the remark, "Here, I want that hat!" at the same time
giving me his tobacco-stained and rusty-looking felt in exchange. My
haversack followed next. It contained, among other things, a number of
despatches and a long list of casualties. The blanket followed shortly
afterwards, and soon I, together with the majority of the prisoners,
had no article of value left. The man who appropriated the haversack
very kindly allowed me to retain two photographs and a
toothbrush. Likenesses were in every instance returned to the owners,
as were also any other small articles of no value to the rebels. As
far as lay in their power, everything was done to make our situation
pleasant. I am but performing an act of simple justice by stating that
Major Harry Gilmore was not cognisant of the conduct of his men. He
strictly prohibited all stealing from prisoners; but the event proved
that the lawless troopers under his command could not be restrained
from filching a purse or a watch when a fair opportunity presented
itself.</p></q>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times </hi>New York correspondent reports
great indifference among the people of that city and of Pennsylvania
(our own correspondent's State) with regard to the Confederate
advance. He writes:--</p>
<q><p>Governor Curtis, of Pennsylvania, is both alarmed and indignant,
and utterly at a loss to account for such lukewarmness--he will not
call it cowardice--on the part of his people. In a proclamation
addressed to the Mayor of Philadelphia and the people of Pennsylvania,
he tells them candidly that they are not responding freely to his and
the President's demands; urges them to come forward "like men" and "do
their duty;" accuses them of stupidity in not understanding the
gravity of the circumstances, and "prays to God to enlighten them,
that the honour of their commonwealth may be preserved." But the
people make no sign. The poor attend to their daily work as if nothing
were amiss; and the rich send away their jewels, their plate, and
their greenbacks to safer cities than their own--some even so far to
the north as Boston, and some still further--to Toronto and Montreal,
out of Federal jurisdiction altogether. The Mayor of New York,
Mr. Gunther, in a letter to Major-General Sandford, commanding the New
York militia, endeavours to persuade that officer that the true place
for the militia is in New York and not in Washington. In this singular
document he states "that in these times of general and local peril
enlightened self-interest is emphatically the synonym of patriotism."
Taking this curious aphorism as the basis of his argument, he
furthermore states his "grave apprehensions" that the withdrawal of
any considerable number of militiamen from the city at this moment,
when the depreciation of the currency is bearing heavily upon the
masses of the people, "might tempt the lawless and evil-disposed to
avail themselves of what might seem to them a favourable opportunity
for arson and plunder," and for that reason "earnestly pretests
against any material reduction" of the local force. It is difficult,
in view of public utterances so significant as these, and of the
indifference, not to say the contempt, with which Mr. Lincoln's
appeals for assistance are everywhere received, to avoid believing
that at last the people are losing heart in the war, and that, if
Mr. Lincoln cannot repel invasion and conquer the South by the
abundant means already placed at his disposal, they are coming to the
conclusion that peace cannot be made too soon. There is no longer any
enthusiasm for the war, unless it be in the counting-houses of those
who are making money by it. Even the Churches have lost faith, and
Dr. Cheever sees nothing but ruin in the war if Mr. Lincoln is left to
conduct it.</p></q>
<p>The only news we have of the forces before Petersburg is that the
Confederates have made demonstrations on Grant's left, with the object
of getting in his rear.</p>
<p>Accounts from Georgia stated that the Federal General Sherman had
followed General Johnston's army across the Chattahooche River, and
had arrived within sight of the defences of Atlanta.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln had issued the following proclamation of his policy on
the question of reconstruction of the Union:--</p>
<q><p>Whereas, at the last Session, Congress passed a bill to
guarantee to certain States, whose Governments have been usurped or
overthrown, a Republican form of Government, a copy of which is
hereunto annexed; and whereas the said bill was presented to the
President of the United States for his approval less then one hour
before the <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi> adjournment of said
Session, and was not signed by him; and whereas the said bill
contains, among other things, a plan for restoring the States in
rebellion to their proper practical relation in the Union, which plan
expressed the sense of Congress upon that subject, and<pb n="111"/>
which plan it is now thought fit to lay before the people for their
consideration:--</p>
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,
do proclaim, declare, and make known that while I am, as I was in
December last, when by proclamation I propounded a plan for
restoration; and while I am also unprepared, by a formal approval of
this bill, to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of
restoration; and while I am also unprepared to declare that the Free
State constitutions and governments already adopted and installed in
Arkansas and Louisiana shall be set aside and held for nought, thereby
expelling and discouraging the loyal citizens who have set up the same
as to further effort, or to declare a constitutional amendment
abolishing slavery throughout the nation, may be
adopted. Nevertheless, I am fully satisfied with the system for
restoration contained in the bill, as one very proper plan for the
loyal people of any State choosing to adopt it; and I am, and at all
times shall be, prepared to give the Executive aid and assistance to
any such people as soon as the military resistance to the United
States shall have been suppressed in any such State, and the people
thereof shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience to the
Constitution and the laws of the United States, in which case military
governors will be appointed, with directions to proceed according to
the bill. In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused
the seal of the United States to be affixed.</p>
<p>Done at the city of Washington, this 8th day of July, in the year
of our Lord one-thousand eight hundred and sixty-four, and of the
independence of the United States the 89th. <hi rend="right"> By the President,</hi></p>
<p>W. H. Seward, Secretary of State.<hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="right">Abraham Lincoln.</hi></hi></p></q>
<p>Washington official records show that upwards of 150 female
recruits have been discovered during the war. Over seventy of these
martial demoiselles, when their sex was discovered, were acting as
officers' servants.</p>
<p>The Confederate steamer Florida has been committing serious
depredations on American shipping off the Virginia and North Carolina
coast. It is reported that she has destroyed at least ten vessels. The
Florida had also captured the transport-steamer Electric Spark, a fast
vessel of 800 tons burden, carrying a valuable cargo of assorted
goods, and bound for New Orleans. Several Federal gunboats have gone
in pursuit of the Florida.</p>
<p>That the Northerners should crow over the destruction of the
Alabama is but natural. The Washington Secretary of the Navy,
Mr. Gideon Welles, in a despatch to Captain Winslow of the Kearsarge,
sends him his promotion to Commodore, and does not forget to recall
the English equipment of the Alabama. He says,</p>
<q><p>You will please express to the officers and crew of the
Kearsarge the satisfaction of the Government at the victory over a
vessel superior in tonnage, superior in number of guns, and superior
in the number of her crew. The battle was so brief, the victory so
decisive, and the comparative results so striking, that the country
will be reminded of the brilliant actions of our infant navy, which
have been repeated and illustrated in this engagement. The Alabama
represented the best maritime effort of the most skilled English
workshops. Her battery was composed of the well-tried 32-pounders of
57 cwt., of the famous 68-pounder of the British Navy, and of the only
successful rifled 100-pounder yet produced in England. The crew were
generally recruited in Great Britain, and many of them received
superior training on board her Majesty's gunnery-ship
Excellent.</p></q>
<p>Secretary Fessenden had appealed to the bankers of New York for a
loan of 50,000,000 dols. until Sept. 1, to meet the immediate wants
of Government; and it is stated that the bankers will accept the
loan.</p>
<p>Gold, after advancing to 280&#xBD;, closed on the 16th at
254&#xBD;.</p>
<p>The State Convention of Maryland, now in session at Annapolis, has
adopted, by a large majority, a constitutional amendment declaring
that "hereafter in this State there shall be neither slavery nor
involuntary servitude, except in punishment of crime whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted; and all persons held to service or
labour as slaves are hereby declared free."</p>
<p>A collision occurred on the 15th inst. between two trains on the
Delaware and Lakawana Railway, in Pennsylvania, by which over a
hundred persons--principally Confederate prisoners, who were being
conveyed to the camp at Elmira, New York--were killed or
wounded.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">...HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi rend="smallcaps">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">...Emigration (America).</hi>--Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">E. Howard</hi> called attention to the subject of
emigration to the United States of America, in reference to the
prolongation of the war now raging in that country. The noble Lord
detailed a number of cases in which a great many mechanics had been
decoyed over to America, under the inducement of good work and high
wages in large firms in Canada. Instead of being conveyed to that
place, they were landed in New York, and there, having been surfeited
with whisky, deserted, without the means of subsistence; and
ultimately many of them were compelled to enter the Federal army from
sheer necessity to escape starvation. He looked with much concern on
the great emigration at present going on, and he advised large
manufacturers to do their utmost to stop the flow of skilled labour
from their several districts. The noble Lord then referred to the
circumstances that occurred a short time ago in Ireland, and
afterwards read extracts from letters written by those who had
unfortunately been deluded into quitting England for America, all of
whom advised their fellow-workmen to look with the greatest suspicion
upon all inducements to visit the United States at the present
moment. It might be that the wages given there would be larger then
those in England, yet the price of the necessaries of life were so
enormous that the lesser sum earned in England went further than that
to be obtained in America. If it were possible, he should like the
Government to give some expression of opinion upon the subject; but he
felt certain the Foreign Office would do all that was possible to
protect those who had been kidnapped from their native land to take
part in a dreadful war which was a disgrace to both contending
parties. The noble Lord concluded by moving for certain papers
relative to emigration.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Layard</hi> said the
noble Lord had done good service in calling attention to the subject
of emigration to America. He could not see how many of the
difficulties mentioned by the noble Lord could be obviated, but he
advised the greatest caution to be observed by all quitting their
native land. The Government had directed the proper authorities to do
all that was possible to protect English emigrants; but, at the same
time, he hoped that all those parties who went to America--it was idle
to suppose that emigration could be stopped--would exercise the
greatest discretion. The emigration officers, the noble Lord might
rest assured, would do all in their power to prevent unfair practices;
but he felt certain that blame was not to be attached to the American
Government. He would willingly give the noble Lord all the papers he
desired.--Mr. P. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hennessy</hi>, seeing the
Secretary for Ireland in his place, said the emigration from Cork to
enlist in the American army was going on at the present time to the
same extent as it was at the beginning of the year.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lindsay</hi> said it was of the greatest importance
that extreme caution should be exercised by emigrants. The present
value of the American dollar was certainly not 4s. 2d. To show the
extent of the horror of the present struggle and the sacrifice of
human life, it was said that upwards of a million of lives must have
been already sacrificed.--Sir R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi>, in
reply to the hon. and learned member, said a proclamation had been
issued by the Lord Lieutenant, which he hoped would check the tide of
emigration from Ireland. The greatest efforts were being used to make
all persons well acquainted with the state of affairs in
America.--After a few words from Mr. P. Taylor, Lord J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Manners</hi> thought that the Emigration
Commissioners should issue a warning, stating that it was not safe for
the humbler people of England to go to America to find a home.--The
motion was agreed to.</p></div2>

<p>A story of almost unexampled horror is given in the American
papers, being the substance of a deposition by a survivor of the wreck
of a ship called the Elvina, which left Calcutta on Dec. 22, bound for
Boston. Her crew consisted of about thirty persons. She was so
fearfully damaged in a storm that she sank, eleven of the crew
clinging to floating spars, but the rest, with the master and his
brother, perished at once. The survivors endured horrible
tortures. Tied to the spars, they lay down upon the sails, and the
seas washed over them. At seven o'clock the wind died away, and,
tearing a shirt in two, they raised a signal of distress. Two
pumpkins, sole relics of the ship's stores, were seen floating nigh,
but not within reach, and they looked longingly upon them as they
passed by. At noon the gale again sprang up, blowing as furiously as
before. The waves swept tumultuously over the raft, carrying away two
of their number. One, George Chase, swam back, and was assisted upon
it, but, soon turning black in the face from swallowing sea water,
died. All through that day and night the storm continued, moderating
towards morning. The sky was overcast the second day, but the wind
went down and the sea became more calm. The sun rose bright and clear
in a cloudless sky the morning of the third day, and his beams beat
most fiercely upon their unsheltered heads. Maddened with thirst, in
their agony, some of them drank the seawater and died. The fourth day
dawned with a sun, though not as lustrous and ardent as
before. Another died. The survivors cut off his legs, and ate for the
first time since leaving the ship. Not a morsel had they eaten, not a
drop of fresh water had they drunk, for four days. The clouds gathered
overhead on the fifth day, but the sun burnt them off and shone more
scorchingly than ever. That evening one of their comrades slipped over
the side, saying, "I am going home, I can stay here no longer--I want
to see my mother--come with me, we shall not be long away, and soon
return." They were too weak to prevent it, and he swam away. Far as
their dim eyes could range did they wistfully watch him swimming on,
the sharks plashing their white fins by his side, till he was lost in
the distance. The sixth day came and went, and another died. The
seventh morning found them hopeless and despairing; too weak to stand,
spiritless and exhausted, they lay feebly clinging to the spars, and
another died. But three were left now of the eleven--and still through
the long forenoon did the burning rays of that terrible sun fall hotly
upon them. At the last moment relief came. The French barque Claire,
Robert master, discovered the raft, their signal fortunately flying,
and dispatched a boat to their assistance.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">When </hi>Mr. Gideon Welles goes out of his
way to assure Captain Winslow that in destroying the "piratical craft
Alabama" he destroyed the best maritime effort of the most skilled
English workshops and the best battery of England, with the only
successful 100-pounder yet produced in Great Britain, served by a crew
of superior English training on board H.M.S. Excellent, we are quite
aware of his meaning. We all know what a pointed aside means in a
tragedy or farce. When the swaggering captain tells his friend, in the
presence of the unmistakable peace-lover, "My pistols are loaded to
the muzzle, and I can snuff a candle at twenty paces," what can he
mean but to terrify the poor fellow. Of course, as may be expected,
poor John Bull shakes in his ironclads, and trembles even at
Wimbledon. But the recapitulation is as gratuitous as it is insulting
and untrue. Captain Blakeley's 100-pounder is not the only one we can
turn out, and the sinking of the Alabama had very little to do with
her guns or her crew--weak wooden sides are not calculated to resist
steel shot, or, as the late Mr. Selby said in one of his farces, "it's
no use a tryin' to stop a cannon ball with a humbrella." Might we
suggest to America U.S. that it is undignified for their Secretary to
the Navy to talk at us like an angry woman at her rival, or to write
like Mr. Jeaffreson Brick, the war correspondent of the New York <hi rend="italic">Stabber</hi>, when he addressed the "tyrannical despot
Victoria, seated, in the midst of her Guards, at her palace in the

<p rend="center">THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS IN CANADA.</p>
<p>...The Conservative party of Canada West, led by the Hon. John
A. Macdonald, and the Radical party, led by the Hon. George Brown, the
editor of the <hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi>, dropped their
weapons and agreed to a compromise. Dividing the Upper Canadian share
of offices between them, they have formed what may almost be called a
Provisional Government on the aforesaid basis of a new Constitution,
the details of which are not yet elaborated, but which will, it is
said, provide for the division of Canada into three provinces, of
which Quebec, Kingston, and Toronto will be the respective capitals,
with Ottawa for the federal capital.</p>
<p>The Canadians are anxious to know how this intelligence will be
received in the "old country." We can only say, for ourselves, that
what pleases them pleases us. While we regard the resolution they have
just taken as an escape from an intolerable situation, we do not blind
ourselves to the fact that it is another step taken towards their
independence of the mother country, at the same time that it is one
tending to make more remote than ever the era of their annexation to
the United States. Anything that develops a robust feeling of Canadian
nationality is well received here, where we are much more desirous to
save Canada from being "swamped" by the United States than to make
sacrifices to perpetuate her political connection with ourselves. The
views of colonial policy first put forth by Adam Smith, and recently
revived with great energy by Professor Goldwin Smith, have certainly
made considerable headway since 1840, when, in the debate already
alluded to, they were championed by such high authorities as Lords
Ashburton and Brougham. The confession lately wrung from Earl Russell
in the Dano-German debate that the menacing aspect of our future
relations with the United States continually hampered the freedom of
our action and weakened our position in the European arena has not
fallen upon unheeding ears; nor do we fail to perceive that our most
vulnerable point of contact with the United States is precisely the
extended and exposed frontier of Canada....</p></div2>

<p rend="center"> THE WAR IN AMERICA.--FIELD'S TEXANS<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">"STRAGGLING TO THE FRONT."</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>Special Artist and Correspondent with
the Confederate army in Virginia, having joined the head-quarters of
General Longstreet's corps, has sent us a sketch representing the very
spirited affair which he witnessed in the outer line of their
intrenchments on the south side of the James River, about thirteen
miles from Richmond. When General Beauregard, on the 15th ult., was
attacked at Petersburg and obliged to collect his forces in that city,
a wide interval was left open between his position and that of General
Lee at Drury's Bluff. The Federals were thus enabled to take
possession of this line of intrenchments, and occupy it in force until
the arrival of Longstreet's corps on the 16th. "At first," says our
Correspondent, "General Anderson, who, in the absence of General
Longstreet from the field, commanded the corps, thought it necessary
to storm the position, and gave orders to Pickett's division to go
in. Immediately afterwards it was discovered that we could get a
better line without sacrificing the men, and the order to assault was
countermanded, but too late; for Pickett was already at it. Field's
division, however, was pulled up, as it was on its way to support the
other; and aides-de-camp were sent to recall Pickett. In the mean
time, Field's Texans got impatient. They straggled to the front by
twos and threes, despite every effort to keep them hack. At last, the
whole body, officers and men, gave a yell, and, with one rush, they
were in the works. The Yankees fled pell-mell to a line of
intrenchments beyond, leaving heaps of dead and dying." The Richmond
correspondent of a contemporary relates the same affair in his most
recent letter:--"Yesterday evening General Lee sent Pickett's and
Field's divisions to retake a line held by the Federals; but, as it
was represented to him by the engineers that a better line could be
secured without any loss of life, he gave an order to recall the
troops. It reached Field's division in time, but Pickett's men had
already 'gone in,' and were at work. The others were at a halt, but
when they saw their comrades engaged, the men commenced straggling in,
first by twos and threes, then by whole companies, then by regiments,
and the officers had no option but to follow. In a few moments the
position was won. The Yankees hardly made a show of resistance. Most
of them saved themselves by flight, but a few were captured, and
proved to be the 'one hundred days' men' who had been caught, to their
great disgust. How different the conduct of the Virginia reserves
drawn from civil life, and hurried to the field in defence of their
families and homes! When this incident was reported to General Lee, he
laughed, and said that 'he had often heard of men straggling to the
rear in a battle, but he had never before heard of their straggling to
the front.'"</p>
<p>A letter from General Lee to General Anderson has been published
relating to this affair. The Commander-in-Chief warmly congratulates
General Anderson upon the conduct of these men; and remarks, "I
believe they will carry anything they are put against. We tried very
hard to stop Pickett's men from capturing the breastworks of the
enemy, but could not do it,"</p></div2>

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Rambles in the Rocky Mountains.</hi> By
Maurice O'Connor Morris. (1 vol. Smith, Elder, and Co.) Where is
Denver City? is a question which Mr. Morris--no doubt,
rightly--supposes very few Englishmen can answer. Howbeit, the events
of the last three years have tended to make "Britishers" better
acquainted than they were before with American geography; and it is,
therefore, not improbable that there are more Englishmen than
Mr. Morris imagines whose eyes have become familiar with the map of
what was heretofore the United States, who could point out "Fremont's
route in 1845," who could even put their finger upon the spot marked
"Denver City," and who could say composedly, "There it is, in
Colorado." Nevertheless, Colorado has certainly not yet been explored
by travelling Englishmen, and the traveller should prick up his ears
and snuff adventure or novelty from afar when Mr. Morris assures him
"that if any <hi rend="italic">fl&#xFB;neur</hi> in London who is
weary of the perfumed airs of Bond-street, and has lost his taste for
moors and stubbles, will cross the plains and pay <pb n="129"/>the
Rocky Mountains a visit, he will return with a keener zest for the
pleasures of civilised life, and with his 'mens sana in corpore sano'
all the fresher for what he has seen and experienced." And we can
assure those who feel inclined to undertake the expedition not bodily
but mentally, not by land and water, but by paper and print, that they
will find Mr. Morris a very agreeable companion and guide "across the
green prairies of Kansas and the sandy saharas of Nebraska" to the
gold-fields of the Rocky Mountains.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">EMIGRATION TO AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Within </hi>twenty-four hours of the closing
ceremonial of the Session of Parliament, and in a House of Commons
consisting of far less than twenty-four hearers, a speech was
delivered which ought not to be allowed to pass into immediate
oblivion. It contained a solemn warning, founded on facts, addressed
to a class of the population of the United Kingdom whose value is
acknowledged in the very circumstance of that warning. Lord Edward
Howard, when he brought forward the subject of emigration to the
Northern States of America, and laid bare its true conditions and
incidents as at present existing, seemed almost to have felt a
presentiment of the new demand for 500,000 men made by President
Lincoln for the prosecution of the war which he conducts on the part
of the Federal States, the news of which was within a few miles of
this country when the remarkable speech of the noble Lord was
spoken. In the brief debate which followed its utterance it was
unanimously declared that the most effectual way of attaining the
object which Lord Edward Howard had in view would be the giving the
utmost publicity to his address; and pointed and distinct appeals were
made to those who control or contribute to the newspapers of the day
to aid in the dissemination of statements which commend themselves to
the serious consideration of those to whom they were specially
directed. Compliance with a request so urged, and based on such
grounds of acceptation, seems to us a simple duty; and it is with a
desire to do what in us lies to spread the information which was laid
before Parliament in a spirit of philanthropy worthy of a
representative of the people that, after the lapse of some days, we
deem it no more than right to revive statements of so much
importance.</p>
<p>As the legal representative of the youthful Duke of Norfolk, it has
been the duty of Lord Edward Howard personally to become acquainted
with the condition of a part of the population of Lancashire which
resides in or about the great Howard property in that district. As a
member of the Relief Committee at Glossop, which undertook to meet the
difficulties and distresses caused by the cotton famine, knowledge of
the baneful operation of the so-called emigration to America was
forced upon the noble Lord. It was made manifest to him that the
labouring population were suffering under a delusion, from which he
has done something to awaken them. The plain fact is, that a system is
in existence which, under the name of emigration, is nothing more nor
less than a base and insidious scheme of recruiting for the Federal
army. In the outset let it be said that, in the strict sense of the
term, we attach no blame to the Federal Government. There is no
evidence of complicity on the part of that Government in the infamous
proceedings which have been brought to light. Indeed, it appears that
the remonstrances of Lord Lyons on behalf of British subjects who have
been kidnapped by false pretences into the Federal army have been
attended to by Mr.Seward in an official manner; but, as everyone
knows, official action at the seat of Government does not necessarily
result in the redress of grievances which are connected with military
organisation in a time of war, especially when it is directed towards
the discharge of men from a force which loses soldiers by hecatombs
and in which the demand for reinforcements is enormously beyond the
supply. Still, the Federal authorities fully acknowledge the injustice
and the oppression of the practices of the recruiting which is going
on, which, in the very nature of things, has fallen into the hands of
agents of the vilest and most unscrupulous character. The military
commandant of New York, the chief recruiting d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t, in
his reports, has spoken of the circumstances under which men are
obtained for service in the field in no measured terms. He says "that
almost every imaginable form of outrage and deception has been
developed; the outrages practised on recruits are too unjust to be
borne, and in many cases too loathsome to be detailed. Many--indeed,
most--of these unfortunate men were either deceived or kidnapped, or
both, in the most scandalous and inhuman manner in New York city."
Doubtless, these candid observations apply to men of all
nationalities, including Americans; but it is in their application to
the men of this country that we especially propose to consider
them. It is undeniable that a regular <pb n="134"/> agency of villainy
has been established in this country, in the north of England and in
Ireland particularly, by which men are induced to abandon prospects of
steady though laborious maintenance in this country by representations
of large wages and more than corresponding social advantages in
America, who, immediately on reaching that land of promise, of
freedom, and of comparative wealth, are decoyed, cajoled, threatened,
and, as the last resort, drugged, until they find themselves enlisted
in the Federal army. They are at once conveyed to the
d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t at Long Island, where they are, under the pretext
of undergoing the training which is indispensable to military
discipline and the making of a soldier, subjected to cruelties,
privations, and outrages which no one has yet ventured to chronicle in
writing; and as soon as possible, but not too soon for their
sufferings, they are sent on to form parts of those forlorn hopes,
composed of the newest arrived recruits, which are recklessly hurled
at the fortified strongholds of the enemy, and to create ramparts with
their dead bodies behind which the main bodies may retreat.</p>
<p>Let it be well understood that every day, by means of the grossest
false pretences, married men, the heads of families, are going out to
America in the hope of avoiding distress at home, who in a few weeks
help to swell the fearful lists of the dead which are reported from
time to time from the seat of war about Richmond. According to the
statements of Lord Edward Howard--the authenticity of which cannot be
denied--men are sought out and offered work, as first-rate mechanics,
in Canada, at large wages, an undertaking is given to pay their
passages out on the condition (the insidiousness of which is to be
observed) that such expenses are thereafter to be deducted from their
wages; and they find themselves at the end of the voyage landed at New
York, where, penniless and friendless, they fall an easy prey to the
recruiting shark. Of the numerous devices to bring about this end it
is only necessary to mention drugging, which has been before alluded
to, the result of which is that the men awake from a stupor and find
themselves in the uniform of the Federal army, and with the usual
attestations of enlistment complete against them; contrivances to get
them into the hands of the police, who, acting in fraudulent unison
with the recruiting agents, threaten and cajole them into enlisting;
while, in the last extreme, the simple method--borrowed from the
practices of, and perhaps carried on by, slave-traders, changing only
the type of man whom they deal in, is adopted, and they are compelled
by mere physical violence to enlist. So complete is the organisation
of the system, that in the vessels of all kinds which run between this
country and New York agents pass to and fro regularly, who ingratiate
themselves with emigrants who have not been entrapped at home but are
voluntarily seeking new--and, as they believe, better--fields for
their labour; and in the result they land under the auspices of these
persons, and are led straight into the pit which gapes for their
ingulfment. As a rule, the men are enlisted in false names, so that
inquiries after them under their real designations are practically
useless; and, even if they should pass unscathed through the perils of
a war which is almost one of extermination, nothing can be heard of
them until that period, so illusory and so hopeless, shall have
arrived when peace is re-established in America. In the event of a man
once enlisted attempting to desert, he is shot as a matter of
course. The vigorous simplicity of this proceeding is obvious.</p>
<p>But, assuming that an English emigrant escapes from or does not
fall into the net of the recruiting agent; that he finds himself on
the shores of America under the conditions which attach to him as a
working-man seeking employment more remunerative and affording him a
prospect of more immediate comforts and greater future prosperity than
he could have hoped for at home, how does it really and truly fare
with him? Is it the fact that he is in a land where ample work, high
wages, and abundance of the necessaries of life are accessible at low
prices? The very reverse is the case. In the first place, a labouring
man, if he obtain employment, which is anything but a certainty, is
paid in dollars--that is, in the notorious green-backs, and he has
been led to suppose that a dollar is equivalent to 4s. 4d. of English
money. Now, the truth is, that a dollar is worth something less than
1s. 6d., so that a man nominally earning eight or nine dollars a week
is receiving in value not more than fifteen or sixteen shillings; and,
as several workmen writing to their friends at home have stated, they
are doing worse in mere money-getting than they were in England, while
the high prices of all sorts of provisions, fuel, and clothing still
further depreciate their gains, and they find that they have
exchanged, perhaps, a struggle in their own country for positive
pauperism in another and a strange land, which is in the agonies of
civil war, of revolution, and may be ere long in a state of
anarchy.</p>
<p>Such are the prospects of emigration to America at the present
moment; and it is well that every effort should be made to bring this
knowledge clearly to the minds of those whom it most concerns. This is
no case for rhetorical artifice; it is not necessary to dress it up
with fanciful garniture before it is presented to the consideration of
the public. There is an eloquence in the facts which will sufficiently
speak to the judgments of those whose duty it is (as in cases like
that of Lord Edward Howard it is their pleasure) to contribute to the
well-being of the working classes. The agency for evil and for
wrongdoing in this particular matter is widespread, active,
unscrupulous. Why should not some counter-agency be set up to meet and
to neutralise the vile operation which is notoriously going on in this
country? The law, trammelled by the rules of evidence, is, in the
main, powerless to deal even with detected offenders. The Executive
Government can only act by means of the law; but there is, as we
think, a remedy to be found in the adoption of that great principle of
association for philanthropic purposes which, almost peculiar to this
country, has so constantly supplemented and aided the law. Even a
small association for the dissemination in a readable form of the
facts which Lord Edward Howard laid before the House of Commons might
do much. Why should it not be tried?</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from New York to the 23rd ult.</p>
<p>It has been authoritatively, though not officially, announced that
Atlanta has been taken by the Federals after a battle fought before
the fortifications on the 21st ult., which resulted in the
Confederates retiring with a loss of 600 killed and 4000 wounded and
prisoners. The Confederate General Johnston had been previously
superseded by General Hood. The Federals, it was added, had cut all
Hood's lines of retreat except that to Macon, and occupied Atlanta. On
the other hand, General Forrest, with 10,000 Southerners, was reported
to be menacing Sherman, and, again, General A. J. Smith, with a corps
of Federals from Memphis, was harassing Forrest. Atlanta is in the
centre of the State of Georgia, about 115 miles south of
Chattanooga. It is the point of junction of four railways: the railway
north, to Chattanooga; the railway south-westward, to Mobile and
Pensacola, on the Mexican Gulf; the railway eastward, to Augusta and
Charleston; the railway south-eastward, to Macon and to Savannah, on
the Atlantic. Atlanta is thus an important strategical point.</p>
<p>Nothing important has occurred at Petersburg. The Confederates are
stated to be engaged in an attempt to blockade the James River, with
the object of cutting off General Grant's communications by
water. Grant is said to have contracted his lines, though still
proceeding with the siege of Petersburg, and to have dispatched
General Sheridan upon another raid on the railway communication with
Richmond.</p>
<p>The Confederates got off from Maryland safely with their booty, and
the attempt of the Federals to pursue them has been abandoned, not,
however, without having somewhat harassed them, and capturing four
guns and some stores. The militia called out in the midst of the alarm
have been dismissed.</p>
<p>There were rumours when the last mail left of a new Confederate
invasion of Maryland vi&#xE2; Muddy Branch and Rockville. A Southern
force of 5000 men was said to have again crossed the Potomac.</p>
<p>The latest despatches also report the discovery of a conspiracy for
the formation of a North-western Confederacy, embracing all the States
in the Mississippi Valley. Several prominent citizens of St. Louis,
implicated in the affair, had been arrested.</p>
<p>News of a Confederate victory comes from Fort Hudson, on the
Mississippi, where the Federal troops under command of General Elliott
were attacked and routed with great slaughter, the roads for miles
being strewed with dead negroes, horses, and arms.</p>
<p>The bombardment of Fort Sumter, of which we have heard very little
recently, has been renewed with increased violence, from thirty to
forty shells being daily thrown into Charleston. The Confederates are
reported to have been successful in driving the enemy from John and
James Island to Morris Islands.</p>
<p>An attempt at negotiation has been made by some Southern
politicians staying at Clifton House, Niagara Falls. Mr. Clement
C. Clay and Mr. J. P. Holcomb, semi-official representatives of the
Southern Government, communicated to Mr. Horace Greeley that they were
willing to proceed to Washington for the discussion with the President
of peace propositions, although not accredited by the Confederate
Government for that purpose. President Lincoln replied, through
Mr. Greeley, by means of a note addressed simply "To those whom it may
concern," that the Federal Government would receive and meet on
liberal terms "any proposition embracing the restoration of peace, the
integrity of the Union, and the abandonment of Southern slavery."
Messrs. Clay and Holcomb emphatically declined visiting Washington,
Mr. Lincoln's answer precluding negotiations by pre-arranging
conditions. If peace could only be secured by submission to terms of
conquest, the generation was yet unborn that would witness the
restoration of peace.</p>
<p>The Confederate invasion into Maryland seems to have produced
considerable effect on the Washington Cabinet, for the President has
issued his order for 500,000 men to serve for one year, to be obtained
by draught, immediately after the 5th of September next, if not
previously obtained by volunteering.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden, the new Secretary of the Treasury, had declined the
terms required by the New York banks for the proposed loan of fifty
million dollars, and determined to offer a popular loan, the interest
of which is to be paid in gold.</p>
<p>Gold, upon the announcement of the occupation of Atlanta, declined
to 251. The last quotation was 254&#xBE; Exchange 271.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Lizzie.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This </hi>steamer has been built, in the
Clyde, for the purpose of running the blockade of the ports of the
Confederate States of America. The vessels most suitable to this
hazardous employment are those of light draught and great speed. The
building of such vessels has developed a large trade, particularly
among the shipbuilders of the Clyde. The Lizzie was launched a few
weeks ago, from the building-yard of Messrs. Henderson, Coulborn, and
Co., at Renfrew, near Glasgow. She had been built to the order of
Mr. W. C. Deeley, of Liverpool. When completed, she took on board a
select party for a short cruise down the Channel, to test her
speed. The result of her performances was far beyond the expectations
of her builders and owners; it gave the utmost satisfaction to
everyone on board. The speed throughout was twenty-two miles an hour,
and that was maintained with the greatest ease. This speed is
unprecedented in the experience of steam-navigation; no steamer of
whatever size having maintained in open channel a speed equal to that
of this little vessel. The principal dimensions of the Lizzie
are:--Length, 230 ft.; breadth, 22 ft.; depth, 9 ft; about 300 tons
gross tonnage. Her engines are on the builders' patent diagonal
oscillating principle, and of 150-horse power, nominal. She has
feathering paddle-wheels and vertical tubular boilers. The same
builders have several steamers on the stocks, intended for the same
trade, and all of them calculated for a high rate of speed. Our
Engraving is from a drawing by Mr. Hugh Aird.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>Engraving on our front page is from a
sketch by our Special Artist and Correspondent with the army of
General Lee, in Virginia. Its subject is thus explained by a short
extract from his letter:--</p>
<p>"Stokes's division was one of those which were sent across the
James River to meet Grant on his approach to Petersburg. Its march<pb n="138"/> formed the most picturesque scene I have ever witnessed. The
woods had caught fire in many places from shells thrown into them, and
the bright flames leapt up the tall trees, casting a ruddy glare upon
the faces of those careless warriors as they passed under the
fir-branches which were dropping flakes of fire. Now and then an old
shell would explode in the undergrowth; but this was looked upon as an
enlivening incident, with which the men were rather pleased. The woods
about Bottom's Bridge are filled with dead Federals, whom their humane
commander, General Grant, has left unburied. Perhaps the burning of
the timber in which these corpses lie will save Richmond from a
pestilence they would otherwise create. For miles outside the works of
Richmond you meet with such fearful traces of the slaughter which the
Federals suffered in their unsuccessful efforts to break through the
Confederate lines."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, August</hi> 6, 1864.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though </hi>we did not attach much importance
to the reports which have reached us in reference to an alleged
attempt on the part of certain gentlemen in America to prepare a basis
for pacific negotiations, the mere hint that such a thing was possible
afforded lively satisfaction in England. Possibly, the majority of
Americans may hesitate to believe this, in the present state of the
public mind in North and South; but hereafter, when peace shall have
been made, justice will be done to the English by such of our
Transatlantic friends as may consult the columns of this Journal,
which we may fairly assume to represent the feelings of the best
classes in this country. We have never ceased to deprecate the cruel
internecine war, and we have all along urged that it might be ended
without detriment to the honour and character of the belligerents. The
statement that Mr. Greeley, Mr. Saunders, and others were to meet at
Niagara Falls and endeavour to devise some plan for terminating the
fearful struggle was listened to with pleasure, even by those who did
not believe that those envoys were precisely the persons best
qualified to shape out a course of policy involving such enormous
questions. The acceptance which the rumour met in America showed that
peace was no longer among the impossibilities.</p>
<p>This "conference" has been as great a failure as another which is
fresh in the English mind. The details are not of much consequence;
but it would appear that the war party in the North is very desirous
to discredit and repudiate the effort. It is sought to cast ridicule
upon the scheme. We see no reason for this. It can never be ridiculous
to try to stop the effusion of blood, to prevent men from being slain
by the hands of those who were but the other day their fellow
citizens. And, so far as we are informed, there was nothing in the
antecedents nor in the conduct of those who were concerned to justify
scoff and sneer. It is much to be regretted that the tone of the
American press generally is below the great occasion that should call
the best pens into existence for the common good. Personality, <hi rend="italic">persiflage</hi>, swagger, are all easy enough; but the
public "guide, philosopher, and friend" should spurn the weapons which
the vulgar can use. We would bring no railing accusation against our
American brethren of the press; but we cannot help feeling that they
have not risen to the work before them, and have been too ready to be
mere repeaters of the idle and violent talk of the masses. Many of
them have yet to learn the grave responsibility attaching to those</p>
<q><p rend="center">Whose echoes roll from soul to soul,<lb/>And live
for ever and for ever.</p></q>
<p>Did the American press and the American pulpit assert themselves
more loftily, much would be done towards a pacification; and though we
do not address these words to fanatics, we believe that there are
numerous influential men in the churches and connected with the
newspapers who will receive in the spirit in which it is offered this
reminder of how much is in their hands.</p>
<p>In England an incident involving a failure often produces the most
fortunate results. An inadequate effort in a given direction turns
men's minds in that direction, if it can do no more; and at a happy
juncture more able men step forth, adopt the principle, and carry it
out with success. In Parliamentary matters this process is very
frequently witnessed, and the failure of weak men brings forth the
energies of the strong. It would be good news in the two worlds did we
hear that the end of the Niagara conference was but the beginning of a
congress with better prospects. What should now prevent it? It is the
custom to answer all British suggestions with the somewhat
supercilious remark that we "do not understand America." This is an
idle phrase. What is there in America or in American affairs that an
active, liberty-loving, practical people, akin to Americans, speaking
their language and reading their literature, should not be able to
comprehend. And when that comprehension is quickened by an earnest
desire for the welfare of the West, we must really be allowed to
characterise the allegation of nonunderstanding as a conventional
impertinence. There is nearly as much ignorance among our uninformed
classes upon foreign affairs as there is among the same class over the
water; but we have failed to perceive any mystery which cannot be
solved by those who are honestly desirous to discover the truth,.We
believe that our journalists understand. American matters as well as
the journalists of America; and we are sure--we say it without
vaunt--that those matters are more gravely and befittingly discussed
here than there. The real reason why we are charged with a want of
comprehension of the case lies in the fact that there is a strong
disposition in the West to go on blindly and take the chances--a state
of mind, of course, which indisposes most persons to make or to
receive definite logic. Fight first and talk afterwards, is a maxim
which has its occasional value; but, in the present circumstances of
America, the rule may be deemed unworthy of toleration. Let us see
whether it is not the turn of talk, and whether the fighting may not
be dispensed with.</p>
<p>One thing is abundantly clear. The question of peace or war is in
the hands of the North. The South asks to be let alone. In this fact
surely the haughty Northerners may find an ample homage to their
pride. It is for them to say whether the sword shall be sheathed or
not. They are the arbiters of the situation. This they are bound to
consider. Then comes the question of honour; and although the Federals
affect to be too philosophical to admit that this consideration is at
the bottom of the war, and though they pretend to rest the struggle
upon certain principles, we firmly believe that they have too much of
the Anglo-Saxon in them to permit them to forget the idea of national
honour. They would like victory because it is victory, and they need
not endeavor to be better or wiser than their Old-World
forefathers. But there are such things as reason and moderation. There
is such a thing as knowing how to accept a situation with honour and
good grace. We have had to do so occasionally, and never more notably
than when George III. recognised the independence of certain
provinces. The nation would have liked to subjugate those provinces,
but it was evident that Destiny had ordained matters another
way. Therefore we consoled ourselves, as the Northerners may well do,
with the recollection that we had done, not our utmost, but more than
enough for our character; and we smote hands with these who thenceforth
became our friends, and whose friendship we ore not ashamed (even amid
certain foolish taunts and menaces) to say that we have ever
valued. What need prevent the Northern States from following the
example of England? Will they place their point of honour higher than
we do? Surely, what England has done the North may do without
shame!</p>
<p>If the best class in America would rise to the work--would put down
the war party, who will protract the strife while there is a dollar to
be gained by the war, and will take the matter into their own hands,
beginning at the basis of satisfied honour--we do not see why we
should not, ere long, receive news of a new conference, and, instead
of such disappointing tidings as have just arrived, we should not
learn with hearty satisfaction that North and South had arranged a
peace. May we soon have to record such a consummation.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Queen's </hi>Speeches are always held to be
the most empty of all human productions. There is generally little to
be said, and the many authors of these pieces are greatly troubled in
finding out the most grammatical way of "how not to say it." This year
they have succeeded, if not perfectly in accordance with syntax, to a
marvel. Nothing could be more empty than the little political exercise
which we heard at the end of last week. It failed to call forth even
one remark from our French friends. Denmark and her troubles are
dismissed in a sentence, and the great war in America, which has as
yet produced the largest crop of troubles both in this country and
across the Atlantic, fares no better. The "scare" in Washington and
New York seems, however, to have produced a better state of mind in
the North; and the difficulties of Mr. Fessenden, the unwillingness of
the merchants to come forward with a new loan, the evident reluctance
of the Northern citizens to recruit a wasted and an exhausted army,
and the rumoured resignation of Mr. Stanton, are items which,
combined, give us some faint hopes of a not very distant
peace. Mr. Horace Greeley and the Peace Democrats will, it seems, soon
supersede the War Christians; and even Mr. Bennett's organ, the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, writes of the war as hopelessly as
our newspapers have any time these two years. The North is slowly but
surely making up its mind to let the" wayward sisters go in peace;"
and the wayward sisters have only to hold their own a little longer,
to defeat Grant and put an end to the last attempt to take Richmond,
and to wait the sure revulsion of public feeling, to obtain their own
terms. It is but fair to say, that the Northern organs of the English
press show a firmness and faith in the great Republic which its own
papers do not exhibit; and we constantly see placards of Federal
successes to-day which either fade away into nothing, or, like those
brilliant sunny landscapes in a magic lantern, suddenly change to all
the gloom and horror of disaster and defeat....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">SKETCHES IN PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p>...On the Thursday a remarkable occurrence took place. It was in
the afternoon, and there were certainly not more than ten or twelve
members present, and the Government was represented only by
Mr. Layard, when Lord Edward Howard, who had placed on the paper a
motion, very modest in its terms, with regard to emigration to
America, rose, and in that simple but earnest manner which belongs to
him, and which gives every one who hears him the impression that they
are listening to an honest man of kindly feelings and warm sympathies,
delivered a statement of facts the relation of which kept the small
audience present, as it would have kept a larger one, enchained for
the whole time he was speaking. His disclosure of the system of
kidnapping Englishmen and Irishmen as recruits for the Federal army,
and his irresistible statements of the disappointments and sufferings
of emigrants who, escaping the perilous devices of crimps who have
learnt their business in the school of the slave-trade, attempt to
utilise their labour in what they believe to be a new and more
favourable field than their own country affords them, struck so much
conviction into the minds of those that heard this Parliamentary
speech, that Mr. Layard declared that the best remedy for the evil
would be the dissemination of that address amongst those whom it most
concerned; and Mr. Ferrand, in his impulsive way, asked if the
Government would not print and circulate it in the form of a
pamphlet. Lord Edward himself made an earnest appeal to th agents of

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Fraser </hi>contains one paper of singular
beauty and interest--those reminiscences of Emerson and his social
circle--which we can hardly err in attributing to Mr. M. D. Conway. It
is a charming picture of<pb n="150"/> a society perfectly frank, pure,
and unaffected; of a friendly intimacy based on a community of
sympathies and untroubled by those wretched jealousies ordinarily so
fatal to the peace of philosophic and literary coteries. It seemed
from the first a happy omen that the centre of New England thought
should be located at Concord, and there are many not merely fanciful
advantages in the spot which is as yet America's nearest approximation
to the groves of the Academy. Secluded amid woods and lakes, Emerson's
friends enjoy whatever advantages flow from intercourse with Nature,
while Boston is near enough for the collision of new ideas and the
stimulus of the busy world. We are indebted to Mr. Conway for some
delightful sketches &#x2014;of Emerson floating in his skiff on Lake Walden;
of the negroes welcoming Theodore Parkes with grateful tears as he
passed amid their poor dwellings in Boston; of Hawthorne escaped from
the party assembled to do him honour to a remote room, and there
discovered reading Defoe's "Ghost Stories;" of Alcott startling
Agassiz with the theory that tigers and snakes were created by man
"before he appeared in his present form."...</p></div2>

<p>According to the monthly emigration returns from Liverpool, which
were completed on Monday by the Government emigration officials at
that port, it appears that though the emigration from the Mersey has
not been so brisk as in previous months, yet the exodus still
continues steady, and the majority of the emigrants, as usual, are
Irish. During the month just ended there sailed twenty ships to the
United States "under the Act." These vessels carried out 7310 steerage
and 267 cabin passengers. The nationality of the steerage passengers
is as follows:--1927 English, 4533 Irish, 239 Scotch, and 611
foreigners. To Canada there sailed four ships, with 421 steerage and
95 cabin passengers, of whom 235 were English, 64 Irish, and 122
foreigners were in the steerage. To Victoria there were two ships,
with 735 steerage and 8 cabin passengers, of whom 239 were English,
406 Irish, 55 Scotch, and 35 foreigners. To Queensland there sailed
only one ship, with 443 steerage and 1 cabin passengers. Of this
number 132 were English, 210 Irish, and 101 Scotch. Apart from the
emigration from the Mersey, we understand the emigration from the Irish
ports direct to the westward continues to be enormous, and this fact
will no doubt account for the apparent dulness at the emigration
offices in Liverpool. Of "short ships," or vessels not sailing under
Government supervision, there sailed to the United States eight ships,
with 500 passengers; to Canada two ships and 55 passengers; to New
Brunswick, one ship and 5 passengers; to New South Wales, one
ship, with 34 passengers; to Victoria, one ship, with 32 passengers;
to the West Indies, four ships and 29 passengers; to South America,
two ships and 34 passengers; and to Africa, one ship and 25
passengers--making a total of twenty ships and 714
passengers.</p></div2>

<p>Immigration of unknown amount would modify the effect of
emigration; but the return of the Emigration Commissioners show that
nearly 20,000 persons of English origin left their native shores for
distant settlements in the quarter that ended on the 30th of June. Out
of that number nearly 12,000 went to the United States, and 5000 to
the Australian colonies, The number of emigrants of all nationalities
was 86,783, of whom about 66,000, chiefly Irish, were bound to the
United States. The emigration to that part of America has not been so
great in the June quarter since 1854. Almost nine tenths of the Irish
emigrants left for the United States.</p></div2>

<p>By the Damascus we have intelligence from New York to the 30th
ult., at which time Sherman had not captured Atlanta, though he was
reported to be drawing his lines more closely round the city. We are
now told that the battle which commenced on the 21st ult. had been
continued on the 22nd, but that General Sherman had repulsed all the
attacks made by the Confederates, whose loss was estimated by their
enemies at 7000 men, while the Federals were alleged not to have lost
more than 2500 men. The dead of the two armies were buried during a
truce on the 23rd; and a Washington despatch states that fighting had
not been renewed up to the morning of the 25th. The Confederate
commander, General Hood, alleges that the battle of the 22nd resulted
in a victory for the Confederates, who on that day captured twenty-two
guns and 2000 prisoners. The Federal forces on the side of Decatur
have also been routed by Wheeler's cavalry, with the loss of their
camp; and General Hardee is operating on Sherman's rear. Rousseau, who
was recently detached with a strong body of cavalry to cut off the
Southern communication with Atlanta, has rejoined Sherman, after
destroying about thirty miles of the Montgomery Railway.</p>
<p>A demonstration was made by General Lee on the 26th ult. against
General Butler's position at Bermuda Hundred. General Grant dispatched
a large force to the north bank of the James River; and these troops
drove the Confederates from their breastworks and captured four guns;
but fighting continued, according to New York accounts of the 29th
ult. A New York despatch, dated the evening of the 30th ult., states
that General Grant had moved two corps to the north of the James
River, was intrenched in a position ten miles from Richmond, and was
reported to have abandoned the siege of Petersburg, and to intend
demonstrating against Fort Darling.</p>
<p>In the Shenandoah Valley, the Confederates who retreated from
Maryland, under General Early, suddenly turned, and defeated part of
General Hunter's troops, under the command of Generals Crook of
Averill, on the 23rd and 24th ult., in the neighbourhood of
Winchester. The Federals retreated to Harper's Ferry, and the pursuing
Confederates occupied Martinsburg and busied themselves in destroying
the Baltimore and Ohio Railway. By the latest accounts we hear that
the Confederates have renewed their invasion of Pennsylvania, a large
body of their cavalry having entered Chambersburg on the morning of
the 30th ult.; and Mosby's guerrillas were near Edward's Ferry, in
Maryland. The Governor of Pennsylvania had issued a proclamation
declaring that the invading force was larger than he expected, and
that arms would be furnished to<pb n="159"/> the citizens for the
defence of Harrisburg, the State capital. All the negroes in Baltimore
had, it as stated, been armed by the Federal authorities.</p>
<p>Secretary Fessenden has opened a subscription for a loan of
200,000,000 dols. in Treasury notes, bearing 7 3-tenths per cent
interest in "greenbacks," and convertible at the end of three years
into bonds bearing six per cent interest, payable in gold.</p>
<p>Gold at New York on July 30 was 255&#xBE;.</p>
<p>A board of naval officers had decided that the men rescued from the
Alabama by the Deerhound were prisoners of war, and the Washington

<p>...As usual many of the accounts of the drought have been
exaggerated, and in the north and south eastern parts of England it
may be said to be at an end. The harvest will be an average good
one. The drought we find from letters and advices, has extended not
only through Europe but to India and also to America, except, perhaps,
to that celebrated Shenandoah Valley, the produce of which the
Confederates have so kindly reaped for the Federals. But if the crop
of wheat in that quarter is not good, the crop of troubles springs up
finely. Mr. Fessenden appeals from the bankers to the people
themselves for a loan to pay the arrears of the
army. Mr. Vallandigham, "with several thousand others," is, we are
told, concerting measures for establishing a North-Western
confederation; and, which touches us more nearly, a court of naval
officers of the Northern States have, after due deliberation, decided
that Captain Semmes and the crew rescued by the Deerhound are
prisoners of war, and, we presume, as such must be delivered by Great
Britain to the United States. Here, then, is a very pretty little bone
for John Bull and Uncle Sam to amuse themselves in
picking....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Cruise of the Alabama and Sumter.</hi> (2
vols. Saunders, Otley, and Co.) The name of Captain Semmes, first of
the Sumter, afterwards of the Alabama, has gone forth into all lands
wherever printed news can penetrate or the trumpet-tongue of fame is
heard. Henceforth the name of Semmes is historic, and "290" is a
charmed number. Sympathisers with Confederates and sympathisers with
Federals were equally moved with wonder and admiration as they read
first how the Sumter, and then how the Alabama, defying and eluding
pursuit, suddenly pounced upon their prey. It seemed that a second
Paul Jones had arisen; the story of the "Phantom Ship" seemed to be
realised. The Federal cruisers were as much at a loss "as if they
dodged a water-sprite," and their commanders must often have cursed in
their hearts the laws relating to "the marine league" and to "the
twenty-four hours' start," which gave their active and audacious foe
so many chances of evading capture or destruction. But neither Sumter
nor Alabama was to go on for ever causing joy to friends and despair
to enemies. A day came when the Sumter was "laid up," and a fatal
Sunday morning dawned upon which Captain Semmes, in the opinion of
some people, lost his head and fought the Kearsarge, and the Alabama
sank stem foremost in the waters of Cherbourg. The adventures of the
two far-famed vessels are now recounted in two volumes, the contents
of which are compiled "from the private journals and other papers of
Commander R. Semmes, C.S.N., and other officers." The account, no
doubt, will be eagerly perused; but the lovers of excitement, the
revellers in naval battles, and the admirers of "fire-eating" will
find very little to entertain them. The only fight (except that fatal
one off Cherbourg) in which Captain Semmes was engaged was one off the
coast of Texas, when he, with a superior weight of metal, sunk the
U.S. gun-boat Hatteras. For the rest, it is a story of eluding
stronger vessels, of weathering storms, of capturing and destroying
defenceless ships, of disputing about the laws of neutrality, and of
quelling mutinies. That there should have been mutiny is not
surprising when Captain Semmes says of the Alabama's crew:--"Many of
my fellows, no doubt, thought they were shipping in a sort of
privateer, where they would have a jolly good time and plenty of
license. They have been woefully disappointed, for I have jerked then
down with a strong hand, and now have a well-disciplined
ship-of-war. Punishment invariably follows immediately on the heels of
the offence. It has taken me three or four months to accomplish this;
but when it is considered that my little kingdom consisted of one
hundred and ten of the most reckless from the groggeries of Liverpool,
this is not much." Joining the last few words with Captain Semmes's
remark, "The modern sailor has greatly changed in character; he now
stickles for pay like a sharper, and seems to have lost his
recklessness and love of adventure" (vol. i., p. 296); and with the
notorious fact that the majority of the Alabama's crew were
Englishmen, one is inclined to think that "hatred to the flag of the
old Union" (vol. ii., p. 295) was not likely to have been amongst
"their chief active passions," and that the only union they were
particularly anxious to keep out of is that which is synonymous with
workhouse. That they were attached to their captain there is no doubt,
and that they fought gallantly is equally certain; but their
antecedents make it more probable that they fought on "Harry Smith of
the Wynd's" principle than on any other; and, though "one who was
hailed from the Kearsarge with the offer of a rescue declined it
civilly and made his way for the neutral flag" (vol. ii., p. 294), it
is more likely that his conduct was prompted by fear of being made a
prisoner than by a chivalrous "detestation of the Yankee." Of course,
all sorts of excuses are made for the defeat of the Alabama; for even
at billiards the defeated player discovers something in his cue, or
the table, or the pockets which was peculiarly unfavourable to him,
and fully accounts for his failure; but it is clear that if Captain
Semmes was aware of the disadvantages under which he would fight--and
he must have known most of them--he ought to have declined the
engagement. Besides, it is not very magnanimous to quote Captain
Winslow's statements (vol ii., p. 291) when they are favourable to the
Alabama and to doubt them (p. 279 <hi rend="italic">et seq.</hi>) when
they are not. We read, also, "a year previous to this meeting the
Kearsarge had laid (<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>) at anchor close under
the critical eye of Captain Semmes. He had on that occasion seen that
his enemy was not artificially defended." It appears, then, that the
Kearsarge was quite willing under these circumstances to fight the
Alabama; and as she had been "constantly in pursuit," it seems very
unlikely that Captain Winslow should have had either inclination or
time for getting "iron-clad." It is not pleasant to read paltry
excuses for the misfortune of a gallant gentleman. Captain Semmes
fought and lost, and there is an end of it. Insinuations against the
truthfulness, fairness, and humanity of his enemy cannot mend the
matter; a dignified silence would have been more becoming. Captain
Semmes has done wonderful damage to his enemies and has been of
wonderful assistance to his cause; it is only to be regretted that his
exploits were not as glorious as they were numerous. His province was
to cripple his enemy's commerce, and he did it to a miracle; and if it
makes the philosopher almost weep to think that so much produce of
human labour--so much subsistence for human beings--should have been
ruthlessly sunk in the barren sea, Captain Semmes is ready with a
justification....</p></div2>

<p>The Government Emigration Commissioners have issued a notice, as
follows, warning emigrants to the United States against the traps laid
for them by Federal crimps:--"Information for emigrants to the United
States.--On arrival at New York you will be landed with your luggage
at Castle Garden, where you will obtain, free of charge, good
accommodation and instructions as to the best mode of reaching your
destination. This establishment is under the supervision of the
Commissioners of Emigration for the State of New York (one of whom is
the president of the Irish Emigration Society), and affords every
facility for obtaining inland passage-tickets by railroad and
steam-boats to all parts of the United States and Canada. Be cautious
in buying in this country, or on board ship, 'Inland passage-tickets'
for travelling in the United States, as you may find them useless on
your arrival in America. You will obtain them cheaper, and run no risk
of imposition, by getting them at Castle Garden, New York. Do not
trust to strangers, whose <sic corr="object">sbject</sic> in offering you assistance is either
to entrap you into enlisting, or to gain your confidence for the
purpose of defrauding you of your money. Do not accept invitations
from strangers to drink, and be especially careful not to get drunk,
or in any way to lose control over your own actions. Be very cautious
as to the engagements you enter into for work. Remember that an
American dollar is nominally equal to 4s. 2d. English money, and a
cent is one halfpenny, but that under the present circumstances of the
country they will not buy more than one third as much of the
necessaries of life as they would formerly buy. By order of her
Majesty's Emigration Commissioners, S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Walcott.</hi>--Government Emigration Board, 8,

<p rend="center">AMERICA--NORTH AND SOUTH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Into </hi>that spirit of partisanship which has
characterised individual feeling in this country in reference to the
contest waging between the hostile States of America we have never
been able to enter. In the reasons given for warmly espousing either
cause we have not found enough to justify their entire adoption. It
has always seemed to us a fallacy to assert that the North is
contending purely for the abolition of slavery, or that the South is
battling merely for liberty. It would be much nearer the truth if it
were laid down that both are struggling for political ascendancy,
while the South is, besides, fighting for what has always been held to
be property. Something may be set down, also, for difference of race,
always an important element of animosity between belligerents. But
what we have ever contended for, in dealing with the American question
as it exists, has been a strict impartiality, not only of action but of
opinion, on the part of this country; a rigid non-interference, moral
as well as physical, and a public feeling expressive only of earnest
hope of a speedy cessation of a civil war unparalleled in its
magnitude and terrible in its accessories. Holding these views, we
conceive that we are entitled to review the position of both parties
as it stood when the latest intelligence left America, and to draw
deductions from that examination, without laying ourselves open to any
suspicion of partiality or bias. Our first, indeed our only, wish is
that the war was over; and it is mainly with reference to the
realisation of that wish that we from time to time consider the
relative situation of the armies opposed to each other and dwell on
the details of these battles which are periodically fought with a
curious similarity of circumstance and result.</p>
<p>Although operations are being conducted in several outlying
districts, principally in the South, and we hear of movements of army
corps here and there, since the siege of Charleston has practically
ceased the chief interest has been concentrated on that small space
which lies between Washington and Richmond. The country between the
Potomac and the Rappahannock has become as familiar to the mind's eye
of the English public as the space between St. Paul's and South
Kensington is to the real vision of the general metropolitan
population. Under whatever General--M'Clellan, Hooker, Burnside,
Meade, or Grant--the ground traversed by the Federals has been nearly
the same, and the object<pb n="182"/> identical--the capture of the
Southern capital; and the issue of each campaign, up to the last
accounts, almost identical also. There has been a continuous series of
assaults by the Federals on the Confederates, more or less in force,
which have been, as a rule, repulsed, with a loss to the assailants of
hecatombs of men, and with serious inroads on the comparatively small
numerical strength of the defenders; and each army has occupied nearly
its original position, although, in the earlier periods of the present
operations under Grant he did manage to fight his way onwards for a
distance which cost him a thousand men a mile. Now, although the
general description of the condition of the opposing forces may not
appear to differ very palpably from that which was given weeks or even
months ago, a careful examination of the state of affairs will show
that a radical alteration has taken place in the position of the
Southerners, and that they stand in an attitude of marked
advantage. It is probably well known that there are at this moment
three points towards which, as the scenes of operations, observation
is especially directed--namely, Petersburg, Atlanta, and
Martinsburg--on the frontier of Pennsylvania. As everyone knows, the
recent attempt of Grant on Petersburg, which he has chosen to consider
as an outwork of Richmond which cannot be turned but must be reduced
from its importance as an obstacle to a march on the capital, has
signally failed; that he has been repulsed with severe loss,
confessedly severe; and that it is supposed that he will have to
retire and throw himself into Washington, unable to arrest the
threatened advance of the Confederates. Hitherto the Federals have
obtained advantages at Atlanta, and the object of the operations at
that point were believed to be close upon being attained. But here,
too, the Confederates have recovered themselves, and hold the Northern
General in check. From Martinsburg the Confederates have started on
another raid into Maryland. It is asserted that the movements at each
of these places are founded on a concerted plan; that they are based
on a certain combination; and that the strategy on which they were
founded is now bringing forth its legitimate fruits. No one has ever
seriously questioned the bravery or the resolution of the North; but
the gigantic efforts which that party has made, the steady draught
which has been made on the resources that it possesses--which have
been proved to be so vast, and which are used as if they were actually
illimitable, and the obstinacy it has displayed--a quality of which
General Grant is now the type and the personification--have in this,
the fourth year of the war, left the Federals in a situation not only
far from successful, but of positive disadvantage, to say no
more. When the South undertook what they conceived to be the duty of
defending by arms their right to secession, they were conscious of all
the hardships and dangers which awaited them; they accepted all the
troubles and responsibilities incident to the enterprise, and they
have held their own and worked their way with a firmness and
persistency undaunted by past losses or future perils. The Federals,
not without reason, assumed that they must win by mere force of
numbers and amplitude of resources; they took their success for
granted; and in some self-complacent way or other they have declined
to recognise the fact that they have not been engaged in a series of
triumphal marches through the country of a flying enemy. Indeed, just
now the probability of a change in the character of the war, by which
the Confederates will cease to be on the defensive and become the
aggressors, is much discussed. For our own parts, we believe that,
independently of military reasons, the advance of the Confederates
upon Washington will be considered as a question of policy. The raids
into some of the Federal States are purely military operations, having
for their objects the distraction of the enemy and the obtaining of
supplies, and are, in fact, temporary in their character. But an
advance by Lee in force into the territory of the North, with the
ostensible purpose of a march upon the capital of that which was the
Union, would be productive, as we think, of exactly opposite results
to those which persons who look at the question from a Southern point
of view anticipate. It would not create such a panic in the North as
to bring about a popular demand for the abrupt closing of the war on
any terms, but it would be much more likely to bring about a really
national concentration of the Federal strength; it would tend to
change the character of the armies of the North, which would then
enrol in its ranks men like those who constitute the military strength
of the South--men of the country, ready to fight for the
country--instead of the Irishmen, Germans, and negroes, who are
thought good enough for food for powder in a crusade against Lee in
Virginia. In short, the quarrel would have a new point of departure
and would become more intensified, more real, more actually a quarrel
between the populations of North and South than now, when it is hardly
more than one between a party in the North, of which Mr. Lincoln is
the representative, and the people proper of the South.</p>
<p>The situation, we conceive, is one which, if for a moment good
sense and good feeling could come into play between the contending
parties, might be turned to advantage. If the Federals could be
brought to admit that the Confederate position is impregnable, that
all has been done which military and national honour require for
victory, they might, without derogation, consent to a compromise in
the interests of humanity and peace. It is quite clear that if the war
is to go on it cannot be conducted by the Federals on a smaller scale
than hitherto; for, vast as have been the forces employed, owing to
the peculiar nature of the country which has to be invaded they have
never been sufficient to carry out the only strategy which could have
been successful. If hostilities continue, the war must resolve itself
into one of extermination. A time must come when men must be wanting
to carry on so sanguinary a contest--nay, a time must come when the
means of obtaining men and mat&#xE9;riel must fail; and the moment of
exhaustion is not that when negotiation can be carried on upon terms
consistent either with mutual fairness or mutual dignity. As we have
said, we think the present juncture one when the voice of reason, of
humanity, and of peace might be raised effectually with the object of
putting an end to a struggle such as the world never yet saw, and
which, whatever may be its issue, generations yet to come will have
to deplore.</p></div2>

<p>General Grant has sustained a severe repulse at Petersburg. The
North estimate their entire losses at nearly 6000 in killed, wounded,
and captured.</p>
<p>Grant had conceived the idea of undermining a fort which was
considered the key of the Confederate intrenchments. The works were
begun on the 28th of June, under the direction of Colonel Pleasants, a
Pennsylvanian engineer of repute; and on the 28th of July all was
ready. A tunnel 500 ft. in length, 5&#xBD; ft. in height, and 4 ft. in width
at the bottom, had been bored. The mine under the fort was charged
with six tons of gunpowder. When the work was finished, Grant, in
order to distract the attention of the enemy, transferred a portion of
his army (as stated in our last Number) to the north side of the James
River; but on the 29th of July they returned. Early in the morning of
Saturday, the 30th, the mine was exploded, and the fort, shattered
into fragments, rose high into the air and came down in a shower of
ruins, destroying the whole garrison, consisting of a body of South
Carolina troops, in the wreck. Hereupon a strong body of Federal
troops advanced, under cover of a tremendous fire from their own
artillery, and captured the mined earthwork and part of the first line
of the intrenchments. To support this force and to seize the inner
lines, two columns of negro troops, under General Burnside, were
pushed on. But the attempt was vain. The inner line of works commanded
the outer, and the assailants were crushed with a storm of shot and
shell. Presently the Confederates, leaving the shelter of their
intrenchments, charged down upon the enemy, and the negro troops broke
and fled, a demoralised mob, to the rear; their officers, who strove
in vain to rally them, being nearly all cut off. The Confederates
swept on with irresistible fury and charged the white troops as
successfully as they had charged the black. The loss inflicted was
terrible. General Bartlett, with his whole Staff, and about 1500
Federal soldiers, were made prisoners. At last the Federals found
shelter within their own defences. It is stated that the Federals, in
their first rush, after the explosion of the mine, took four hundred
prisoners. Excepting this and the men killed in the fort, the South
does not seem to have suffered any serious loss. On the 31st
ult. President Lincoln went to Fort Monroe, and had an interview with
Grant. On the 2nd inst., the Federal dead were buried, a short truce
having been made for that purpose. Rumours are rife that Grant is
about to be transferred to Washington; but there is no sort of
evidence that he has any intention of abandoning his position on the
south side of the James River.</p>
<p>The Confederates have recrossed into Maryland in force and occupied
Hagerstown. There is no definite information, however, as to their
movements. A small body of their cavalry has burned the greater
portion of Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania, because a required
contribution was not paid. The Governor of Pennsylvania has called for
30,000 militia for immediate service. Great alarm exists among the
population in the Cumberland Valley. The Pennsylvanian farmers are
driving off their stock.</p>
<p>It has been non-officially reported from Washington that, on the
27th ult., General Hood made another attack upon Sherman's intrenched
position at Atlanta, but was repulsed with a loss of nearly 1000 in
killed, the Federal loss being a little over 600 in killed and
wounded. Confederate accounts state that on the night of the 24th
ult. General Sherman attempted to break Hood's lines, but was repulsed
by General Cheatham after a sharp fight, lasting an hour. The Federal
cavalry under Stoneman are said to have cut the railroad communication
between Macon and Atlanta; but General Hood reports that Stoneman had
been captured with 500 of his men. Another paragraph says that General
M'Call's division, while retreating, was routed, and a large portion
of his forces captured.</p>
<p>It is stated, non-officially, that Admiral Farragut's fleet of
ironclads had passed the forts at Mobile, and was preparing to attack
the city.</p>
<p>Some members of the committee on the Confederate States have issued
a report charging President Lincoln with usurpation of power and
seeking to secure re-election by unfair means.</p>
<p>Richmond papers announce the re-election of Governor Vance in North
Carolina--Holden, the peace candidate, receiving but few votes. The
Southern papers regard Vance's election as an endorsement by he people
of North Carolina of the policy of the Richmond Government.</p>
<p>Gold has gone up to 260.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE WAR IN AMERICA.<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">The Town
Of Petersburg, Virginia.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>Illustration of the American war for
this week consists of a View of the town of Petersburg, Virginia, now
besieged by General Grant. This view is taken from the Richmond
side. The railway bridge across the Appomattox is seen towards the
left, and a large factory beyond. The river is navigable only below
bridge, as there are rapids above. Ships of considerable draught can
approach Walsall's Landing, about six miles down, and smaller vessels
may come quite up to the city. Petersburg is contemporary with
Richmond, both cities having been laid out in 1733, and having
continued to be rivals in commerce, until Richmond acquired a special
importance by being made the capital of the State. The population of
Petersburg was about 12,000 before the war. It had six churches,
several large cotton and tobacco factories; and was a place of
considerable trade, exporting flour, cotton, and tobacco. As early as
1645 a fort, called Fort Henry, was erected at the falls of the
Appomattox, on the point where Petersburg now stands, for the defence
of the neighbourhood against the Nottoways and other Indian
tribes. Soon after this, Peter Jones, one of the first settlers of
Virginia, established there a trade with the Indians. The place where
he fixed himself was precisely where the two principal streets now
meet; and was in consequence called Peter's Point, but the name was
afterwards changed to Petersburg. Two suburbs have since been
incorporated with the city, one called Pocahontas and another
Blandford, at which latter place are the ruins of an old church, and
which, being on high ground towards the southern side of the town,
must now be much exposed to the Federal fire.</p>
<p>Petersburg was occupied at one time by the British troops in the
Revolutionary War. They approached by the same route now adopted by
the Federal Generals--namely, by way of James River to City Point,
where an army was landed, under General Phillips, in<pb n="193"/>
1781, and marched into the city. The British, on that occasion,
destroyed quantities of tobacco and burned down all the fences and
many wooden buildings for fuel. While General Phillips lay ill of a
bilious fever at Bolingbroke House, a private mansion which he had
made his head-quarters, the Americans, under General La Fayette,
cannonaded the town from Archer's-hill, on the side which is shown in
our Engraving, directing their fire particularly against Bolingbroke
House, in order to avenge the depredations of the "invaders," so that
poor General Phillips--of whom Jefferson said, "he is the proudest
man of the proudest nation upon earth"--was conveyed to the cellar
for safety, where he exclaimed, "Won't they let me <hi rend="italic">die</hi> in peace?" However, not the cannon-ball but
the fever terminated his existence, and he was buried in Blandford
churchyard. One week later Lord Cornwallis entered the town from
Wilmington, on the south, by the same line on which the Federals are
now threatening the town; and his Lordship fixed his head-quarters at
Bolingbroke House. A great part of Petersburg stands on high ground,
much exposed to the fire from neighbouring hills.</p>
<p>General Winfield Scott is a native of Petersburg.</p></div2>

<p>General Grant has returned to Petersburg, after having visited
Washington and the Upper Potomac. On the 5th the Confederates charged
his lines, but were repulsed with great slaughter.</p>
<p>Hagerstown has been reoccupied by the Federals, and the
Confederates, having withdrawn from Maryland into Virginia, have, on
the authority of scouts, been attacked and defeated by Averill at
Moorfield, with the loss of 600 prisoners and four guns.</p>
<p>General Hunter has been superseded by General Sheridan, who has
been placed in command of the Middle Military Division, embracing the
department of Washington, the Susquehanna, Maryland, and Western
Virginia.</p>
<p>At last accounts the situation at Atlanta remained
unchanged. General Sherman was strengthening his position, and
vigorously preparing his siege operations. Hood maintained his lines,
and was thought to be making every exertion to interfere with
Sherman's communications. It was reported that large bodies of Georgia
militia had reinforced Atlanta.</p>
<p>Letters from General Sherman's army state that the battle on the
28th ult., previously mentioned, was brought on by an attempt by
General Hood to outflank General Sherman while extending his
right. The contest was most severe, and for a time the result was
doubtful, though ultimately the Federals repulsed their
assailants.</p>
<p>The report of the capture by the Confederates of General Stoneman
and a portion of his command is fully confirmed.</p>
<p>The accounts of Admiral Farragut's operations at Mobile were
derived from despatches sent by the Confederate authorities to
Richmond. From them it appears that seventeen Federal war-steamers
passed Fort Morgan on the morning of the 5th, but that the monitor
Tecumseh had been sunk by the fort. The Confederate Admiral Buchanan
and the iron-clad steamers Tennessee and Selma had been taken by the
Federals, and the Gaines had been driven ashore. The Federal fleet had
approached the city, and a body of Federal troops had been landed on
Dauphin Island, in the rear of Fort Gaines.</p>
<p>The American correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy
Gazette</hi> gives the following account of the seacoast defences of
Mobile:--</p>
<q><p>The entrance to the bay is between Mobile Point and the eastern
point of Dauphin Island, the distance between them being about three
miles and three quarters. The interior of the bay has water enough for
any vessel which can cross the bar, which has about 15 ft. upon it at
low water. A shoal opposite the mouth of Dog River, eleven miles south
of the city of Mobile, prevents vessels drawing more then 8 ft. going
further up the bay. A short distance above the mouth of Dog River, and
on the bar bearing the same name, obstructions have been placed and in
some places old vessels have been sunk,
blocking up the channel, leaving only a narrow passage through them so
that their own vessels can pass through. Lines of intrenchments have
been thrown up, encircling the city from near Dog River around to the
Alabama river, and no less then twelve large independent and outlying
earthworks command the obstructions and the approach to the city. On
Pintos Point is a formidable earthwork, mounting nine large guns; at
Garrow's Bend is a five-gun battery, commanding the river obstructions
and the main channel for a distance of three miles. The remaining
earthworks in that vicinity are intended to repulse the landing of
troops on the western shores, or a land attack, which could be made at
Portersville, on Mississippi Sound, and thence marching up by the road
to Spring Hill. The intrenchments are about fifteen miles in length,
and were thrown up some time ago. A tract of marshy land has been made
solid by means of spiles and earth, and on this has been erected a
casemate-battery, armed with ten heavy guns--viz., three 100-pounder
rifles, four 9-inch Dahlgrens, and three long 32-pounders. Between
this battery and the Alabama river, near the latter, is a redoubt
whose guns can sweep the level plateau over which it keeps guard as
well as commanding a portion of the bay. Passing further to the north,
another redoubt is met, mounting four guns; this commands a portion of
the railroad. At Three-Mile Creek, guarding the railroad, is still
another and quite as formidable a work; and between the Alabama river
and the Shell-road is a six-gun battery. Fort Morgan, the main
protection of the city of Mobile, is located on a long, low, sandy
peninsula, called Mobile Point, at the entrance of the bay. It cost
the United States in its construction nearly a million and a half
dollars, and is capable of mounting 132 guns and of garrisoning 700
men; but, with the water-batteries erected near it, its present
garrison does not fall far short of 1500 men. Fort Gaines, or Dauphin
Island, is a smaller work, and is said to mount from fifty to sixty
guns, and has a garrison of about 900 men.</p></q>
<p>South Carolina advices to the 5th report a heavy bombardment of
Fort Sumter and Charleston in progress. The Federal officers placed
under fire at Charleston, and the Confederate officers held under fire
on Morris Island by General Foster in retaliation, have been
exchanged. This releases on each side five generals and forty-five
field officers.</p>
<p>General Birney recently made a successful raid into Florida,
destroying several bridges and a portion of the railroad between
Fernandina and Baldwin.</p>
<p>Several of the New England States are vigorously recruiting,
through special agents, among the blacks in General Foster's
department to fill their State quotas under the recent call for
troops.</p>
<p>A rumour prevailed at New York that a Confederate raid was to be
made from Canada into Buffalo, with the view of destroying the Erie
Canal.</p>
<p>It is also asserted that Mr. Stanton, the Secretary for War, has
tendered his resignation.</p>
<p>The New York police, in conjunction with the English detectives,
have made every arrangement to arrest M&#xFC;ller on his
arrival.</p>
<p>The Southern papers announce the appointment of the Hon. George
A. Trenholm as Secretary of the Treasury, in the place of the
Hon. C. G. Memminger, resigned. Mr. Trenholm is a native of
Charleston, about fifty-five years of age, and the senior partner of
the firm of John Fraser and Co., of Charleston, which, with its
Liverpool branch, Fraser, Trenholm, and Co., has been extensively
engaged in blockade-running enterprises since the beginning of the
war.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are now at Andersonville, South Carolina,
over 30,000 Federal prisoners, and that over 2000 died there during
the month of June.</p>
<p>The steamer Georgia, under British colours, has been captured by
the Federal steam-frigate Niagara off the mouth of the Tagus. It will
be remembered that the Georgia, which was built in an English port,
cruised for some time as a Confederate man-of-war, and was then sold
at Liverpool. She was bought by Mr. Bates, a merchant of that town,
and is alleged to have been chartered by him to the Portuguese
Government as a packet between Lisbon and the West Coast of
Africa. She sailed from Liverpool on the 8th inst. "with a very
valuable cargo," said to be intended for Lisbon and the West Coast of
Africa; and on the 15th she was captured near the mouth of the Tagus
by the Niagara. A prize crew was put on board, and she was sent to New
York, while the Niagara steered for the British Channel, and has landed
her prize's men at Dover.</p></div2>

<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, Aug. 12,
Evening.</p>
<p>Official Confederate despatches from Mobile, dated the 8th inst.,
state:--It is painfully humiliating to announce the shameful surrender
of Fort Gaines by Colonel Anderson. Colonel Anderson communicated with
the enemy by a flag of truce without the consent of General Page, who
inquired, by signal, what his purpose was, but received no
answer. General Page telegraphed "hold your fort," and immediately
visited Fort Gaines, when he found that Colonel Anderson was on board
the Federal fleet, arranging a capitulation. The General left orders
for Colonel Anderson, on returning, not to surrender the fort, and
relieved him of his command. Fort Morgan signalled this morning, but
received no answer except the hoisting of the Federal flag over the
ramparts of Fort Gaines. Colonel Anderson's conduct is pronounced
inexplicable and shameful.</p>
<p>The Confederates evacuated and blew up Fort Powell on the 7th
instant. The whole Confederate fleet, except one vessel, is sunk,
beached, or captured.</p>
<p>General Sheridan's forces are moving up the Shenandoah Valley
against the Confederates. General Averill's success at Moorefield,
Virginia, is confirmed.</p>
<p>The Federal loss during Stoneman's raid is reported to be 1000

<p>An enormous mass meeting has been held at New York to nominate

<p>....A topic has arisen, and it will be welcomed. A Federal frigate
has made capture of a vessel from an English port, and said to be
under the English flag. The Georgia has been taken by the Niagara. The
former was once a Confederate vessel and wrought wild work with
Federal commerce, but she has been sold to an Englishman, and he has
had her chartered by the Portuguese, or so it is stated. Had the
Niagara a right to seize her? Was her old character done away? Had she
become an English ship? Will Earl Russell demand explanations? If she
is not given up, shall we go to war with the North, recognise the
South, and rush into the affray out of which we have kept so long? The
future will decide all these questions; our present duty is to "write
and be thankful" for a new topic in this dreary season.</p></div2>

<p>On Thursday a marriage of considerable interest took place at the
Church of St. James, Piccadilly. The bridegroom, Lieutenant Samuel
Wylde Hardinge, was an officer in the United States navy, holding the
rank of Lieutenant on board the American war-steamer Connactuca. The
lady was the daughter of General Boyd, of the army of the Southern
States, who lately died in prison, having been made prisoner by the
Federals. Her father, General Boyd, who possessed vast estates in the
territory of Virginia, early embraced the cause of Southern
independence, and was soon intrusted with a command, obtaining the
rank of General. His daughter, the bride, enthusiastically embraced
the same cause, followed her father to the field, and accompanied him
throughout his campaign with the celebrated Stonewall Jackson, and on
two occasions led on the troops to battle; she was, however, in a
skirmish, captured and made prisoner, and conveyed to Washington,
where she was imprisoned. Here she remained thirteen months, when she
was exchanged for General Cochrane, who had been made prisoner by the
Confederates. On her return to the South, she went on board the
Greyhound, Confederate steamer, which was captured by the Federal
steamer Connactuca while running the blockade. Lieutenant Hardinge was
sent on board the Greyhound as prize-master, with his young heroine as
a prisoner. The result was that they mutually became enamoured, and
escaped together from the ship, and found their way to this country,
the bride having succeeded in withdrawing her lover from his
allegiance to the United States flag, and enlisted his sympathies and
support for the South.</p></div2>

<p>The Commissioners of Customs have issued a general order to the
collectors at the various ports that, in pursuance of instructions
from the Lords of the Treasury, "no ship of war belonging to either of
the belligerent Powers of North America shall be allowed to enter any

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">That</hi> "half a loaf is better than no bread
at all" is a proverb, the truth of which no Englishman thinks of
doubting, and of which certain American statesmen begin to perceive
the truth. It is all very well for contractors for the commissariat of
an immense army, and for such recruiting officers whose pleasant
duties lead them away from the front, to still cry out "War to the
bitter end;" but for those in the front, poor fellows! the bitter end
has indeed arrived; and, in justice to their good taste, it must be
said that they do not like it. To strike ten thousand dead in one
week--of whom three fifths die by war and the rest by pestilence--is
an act for which no Government can be applauded, unless it is gilded
by the sunshine of success. But in the lurid flames about
Petersburg--nay, even at Atlanta and Mobile--there is indeed no real
glimmer of that blessed sunshine which we all worship. Foreseeing
this, we have for some weeks caught the faint echoes of the word
"Peace!" echoes which are growing louder every day, and which must
eventually make themselves heard. Amongst the blessed effects of the
"Seasons" there is one upon which even Thomson never wrote, and that
is, that horrid winter, succeeding golden autumn, does give a pause to
the operations of war, and generally terminates what is called a
"campaign."</p>
<p rend="center">Come, gentle Spring, ethereal mildness, come,</p>
<p>cries Thomson, impatient of Winter; but now we would substitute
peace for the second monosyllable, and welcome the hardest American
winter that ever split the frozen toes, brittle as icicles, from the
feet of a backwoodsman, so that it would only give a pause and
inaction which could bring better thoughts to both parties. It will be
to the credit of our Government if, with a tender and delicate hand,
it urges its good offices to each belligerent. The dove is about to fly
from the ark; may it not be furnished with an olive-leaf from this
Isle of Liberty?</p>
<p>Out of evil comes good. Everyone knows that our best books are
reprinted in America because the duty is so high that it absolutely
amounts to a prohibition; the same is the case now with our papers,
and publishers and rich people can alone afford to buy them. There is
a talk of reproducing <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> in New York, and
selling it cheaply there, and also of reprinting many of the best
articles from our daily papers and issuing them in a cheaper
form. This method has for a long time been pursued with our magazines,
and has the advantage of giving our cousins the benefit of a calmer
style and of English thought. It cannot fail to do good if the
American mind will accept our free criticism as calmly as we take
theirs, notably let us say, of Emerson and Hawthorne, the former
appreciative, the latter abusive. So susceptible, however, is the
Yankee mind, that we hear that in New York a reprint of "The Gentle
Life" is to be edited, so that all anti-American reflections of that
mild and popular series of essays are to be carefully removed. Let us
hope that this will not be the case with all our outspoken and
vigorous writers....</p></div2>

NEWS.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from New York, by way of Cape Race, to the 22nd
ult.</p>
<p>Two corps of General Grant's army, under Hancock, have been moved
to the north side of the James River, for what object does not
appear. On the 14th ult. a portion of the second and tenth corps
advanced against the Confederate position at Deep Bottom, and captured
part of a line of works, with four guns and nearly 300 prisoners. The
Confederates fell back to a strong position, against which the
Federals advanced across an open field, but encountered a heavy fire
from the Confederate artillery, and, being unable to advance further,
the troops were concealed as much as possible until dark, when they
were withdrawn. The Federal loss in these operations is estimated at
1000 men. On the 16th General Gregg's cavalry division drove the
Confederates from some works on the Newmarket road, but the
Confederates rallied, and Gregg was compelled to fall back on his
infantry supports. Whatever may have been the purpose of the Federal
movement to the north side of the James, it seems to have failed, for
we learn by the latest telegrams that the troops had recrossed the
river.</p>
<p>The Confederates at Petersburg shelled Grant's lines for three
hours on the morning of the 17th ult. On the 19th ult. the 5th Corps
of Grant's army took up a position on the Weldon Railroad, where,
according to one account, the Confederates attacked but failed to
dislodge them. Another account, however, states that the Federals were
surprised by the Confederates, and driven back with the loss of 3000
men; that they were subsequently reinforced, and recovered lost
ground; and that fighting continued.</p>
<p>Butler is assiduously employed in cutting a canal across the
peninsula of Farries Island, with a view to enable his gun-boats to
avoid the river obstructions below Drury's Bluff.</p>
<p>The news from the Shenandoah is of an exciting character, the tide
of battle flowing southward or northward, according to the strength
of the respective parties. On the 17th ult., we are told that General
Merritt's cavalry was attacked by a Confederate force, and that
after<pb n="231"/> a sharp fight the latter was routed, leaving 300
prisoners. It having subsequently been ascertained that heavy
reinforcements had reached General Early, and that the Confederates
were man&#x153;uvring to get in the Federal rear, General Sheridan
fell back from Strasburg to Berryville. While the retrograde movement
was being executed, Sheridan's rear-guard was overtaken near
Winchester by the Confederate advance, under Breckenridge, and
suffered severely.</p>
<p>There was a rumour in New York on the 20th that Sheridan had met
with a disaster at the hands of the Confederate General, and had been
obliged to retreat to Harper's Ferry.</p>
<p>Despatches from Admiral Farragut's fleet confirm the Confederate
accounts of the operations at Mobile. The squadron passed Forts Gaines
and Morgan under full steam, giving and receiving a terrible fire. The
Federal loss during the whole engagement amounted to about 250 men,
including the crew of the monitor Tecumseh, which was instantaneously
sunk by a torpedo. The Confederates had abandoned Fort Powell, and the
garrison had unconditionally surrendered Fort Gaines to the Federals,
who were preparing to invest Fort Morgan, which they had already begun
to shell from two mortar-vessels. The garrison had destroyed all the
outbuildings and manifested a determination to hold out to the
last. The fort is known to be well garrisoned and provisioned. A body
of Federal troops was also said to be advancing from Pensacola in
order to flank Mobile. Confederate accounts continue to regard the
surrender of Fort Gaines as an act of treachery. The Mobile<hi rend="italic"> Register</hi> of the 10th ult. states that
General Maury has ordered non-combatants to leave that city. The <hi rend="italic">Register</hi> says:--"There is no thought of
surrendering the city, nor any belief that it can be taken."</p>
<p>Advices from General Sherman's army to the 17th ult. report that
the Confederates are vigorously operating against the Federal
communications. On the evening of the 14th ult. General Wheeler, with
1700 cavalry, demanded the surrender of Dalton. The Federal Commander,
Colonel Siebold, whose force amounted to only 800 men, refused to
yield the position, and maintained a stout resistance until the
following morning, when Federal reinforcements arrived, and the
Confederates were driven off. It is reported that a severe engagement
occurred at Graysville, eighteen miles from Chattanooga, between
Wheeler's command and the Federal forces under General Steadman. The
result is not stated. General Steadman was severely wounded, and
Colonel Straight, of the 51st Indiana, was killed. A squad of
Wheeler's men had gone to destroy the tunnel at Tunnel Hill. General
Sherman was rapidly completing his preparations for the bombardment of
Atlanta. Hood still maintained a bold front, and there were even
indications that he would assume the offensive. He is known to have
received heavy reinforcements.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Sentinel</hi> states that Chalmers
achieved a victory over the Federals at Abberville, Mississippi, on
the 14th ult., inflicting on them severe loss.</p>
<p>Hostilities by the Indians in the north-west have been
renewed. Many of the settlers in Kansas have been murdered, their
houses and crops burnt, and their cattle driven off. The inhabitants
generally are fleeing to the towns for protection.</p>
<p>Generals Blunt and Sherry, commanding on the border, are organising
a large military force to pursue and attack the Indians.</p>
<p>The Peace Democrats had a convention at Syracuse, New York, on the
17th ult., in which they went in for a peace candidate for the
presidency, and for an armistice. The telegrams state, but without
giving any authority, that a desire for peace is gaining ground. The
<hi rend="italic">New York Herald </hi>urges that commissioners should
be sent to Richmond in order to propose an armistice for six months
and the convocation of a convention from all the States to devise the
best means of obtaining peace. The correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> writes, however, in a different
strain. He states:--"I do not think the Northern public was ever one
jot more confident of final success, or more determined to persevere,
than it is at this moment, and the events of the campaign, though they
have not been such as many people hoped for at the outset, have
certainly not been such, so far, as to cause any despondency."</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd ult. gold was quoted at 256 7/8.</p>
<p>The Confederate cruiser Tallahassee has made sad havoc among
Federal shipping, having burned more than fifty merchantmen and
fishing-vessels off New York and the coast of the Northern States. She
arrived recently at Halifax, but was ordered off, whilst coaling, by
Admiral Hope. The following is her description, published in the New
York papers:--</p>
<q><p>The privateer Tallahassee is an iron steamer, painted white,
with two smokestacks, two screws, about 230 ft. in length, 20
ft. beam, and draws about nine feet of water. Her bell is marked
"Tallahassee, of London, 1864." Engine marked "J. and W. Dudgeon,
London." She is fore-and-aft schooner-rigged, mounts three guns--one
small one on the topgallant forecastle, a long 32-pounder amidships,
and a 24-pounder aft. She carries four waist-boats. Her crew consists
of about 120 persons, including the officers. Men of all nationalities
are represented on board, most of whom are said to be soldiers from
Lee's army. She is said to have run out of Wilmington about six days
ago, without having been seen by any of Admiral Lee's blockaders. She
has a quantity of cotton on board to protect her boilers, and there
are four barrels of turpentine on deck to be used in firing
vessels. She is commanded by John Taylor Wood, C.S.N. The surgeon,
Sheppardson, says he was one of the Chesapeake pirates. A Mr. Hall is
the boarding officer. The crew are dressed in rags and tatters. Some
of them wear their pistols tied to them with Manilla rope yarns. They
are a hard-looking set.</p></q></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>Special Artist in the camp of
General Lee has sent us his sketch of a panoramic view of the town of
Petersburg and adjacent country, including the camp of General
Grant. The Engraving of this view extends twice across two pages of
our Paper, the lower half being intended to join the upper half, end
to end. We gave some account of the town of Petersburg with our View
of that place which was published a fortnight ago. In our present
Illustration, though it has been impossible to show the lines of the
two contending armies, their relative positions can partly be made out
by starting from the tents of the Federal soldiery, which are shown
upon a rising ground at the extreme left of the upper half of our
Engraving, and following from left to right the indications of
earthworks and rifle-pits until they are concealed by the foliage of
the wood. At the extreme right-hand corner of the second portion of
the view we come upon General Lee, with his staff officers, partly
sheltered behind a clump of trees, and watching the enemy's movements
through a field-glass. Our Correspondent, writing on the 18th of July,
says that the shell-firing from the Federal side had been entirely
bestowed upon the women and children, who still remained in the town,
and that it had not done the slightest injury to the Confederate
troops, who were lying snug enough in their trenches beyond the belt
of wood which surrounds Petersburg. The men of the advanced posts on
both sides would sometimes leave off shooting at each other, come
forward, and have a friendly talk.</p></div2>

<p>There has been a fierce struggle between Generals Lee and Grant for
the Weldon Railway. On the 19th ult. the Federals took up a position
on it, but were surprised and driven back, with a loss of 3000 killed
and wounded. The Federals, being strongly reinforced, regained the
position; and, though the Confederates made repeated efforts to
dislodge them, they maintained an intrenched position at the Reams
station on the 27th. The Weldon line was of great value to the
Confederates, as by it a large portion of their supplies from
Wilmington, Charleston, and the Carolinas was brought.</p>
<p>An engagement took place in the Shenandoah Valley on the 21st ult.,
between Generals Early and Sheridan, near Charlestown. The loss on
both sides was severe; but apparently the latter had the worst of it,
for he fell back to Halltown, a small place near Harper's Ferry on the
Virginia side. Early proceeded to Martinsburg, whither it was reported
General Lee was advancing to join him with a large force, with the
intention of invading Maryland.</p>
<p>Sherman's position in front of Atlanta was said to be unaltered,
but his cavalry had cut ten miles of the Macon railroad. As this is
the sole line along which supplies for the defenders of Atlanta can be
brought, its destruction is an important achievement. On the other
side, the Confederate Wheeler had cut the Knoxville and Chattanooga
railway, along which some of the Federal supplies were brought.</p>
<p>From Mobile we have news that the Federal troops from Pensacola
were advancing to the bay, and General Granger was within five miles
of Fort Morgan. Th Mayor of Mobile had ordered all non-combatants to
leave the city, which was to be defended to the last extremity. The
Confederates have sunk a steamer in Mobile channel, rendering access
to the city impossible until removed.</p>
<p>The Tallahassee burnt twenty-two fishing-vessels off the North Cape
of Prince Edward Island on the 25th ult.</p>
<p>Rumours of peace negotiations are again current in New York, and
the <hi rend="italic">Herald </hi>states that overtures either for
peace or an armistice had been made to the South by the
Administration. A semi-official denial has, however, been given to
this statement.</p>
<p>Gold had gone down as low as 250 7/8; but this was attributed to
the probability of M'Clellan being nominated President by the Chicago
Convention.</p>
<p>Chicago despatches report that the nomination of General M'Clellan
by the Convention is considered certain, and that of Pendleton, of
Ohio, for Vice-President. Several prominent Abolitionists have urged
President Lincoln and General Fremont to withdraw their names as
presidential candidates, and to call a convention to nominate a fresh
Republican candidate. General Fremont has consented to withdraw if
President Lincoln will do so also.</p>
<p>The Victoria, the London packet-ship which had Franz M&#xFC;ller,
the suspected murderer of Mr. Briggs, on board, arrived at New York
on the 24th ult. M&#xFC;ller was apprehended, and the hat and watch
of Mr. Briggs were found in his possession. Nevertheless, he protested
his innocence. Mr. Death, of Cheapside, jeweller, identified
M&#xFC;ller positively as being the man who bartered Mr. Brigg's
chain with him; and the cabman, Matthews, also swore to his
identity. The legal proceedings precedent to his extradition for trial
in England were progressing on the 27th ult.</p></div2>

<p>....The New Yorkers are, as we have said, busy in their election,
just as in the spring we shall be busy in ours. The opinion runs very
much in favour of M'Clellan; certainly, his only dangerous opponent is
Lincoln himself. The pro-war party depend upon a continuation of the
war to the "bitter end" by Lincoln or Fremont; they look to immediate
peace at the hands of Vallandigham, and to peace upon a solid basis
from General M'Clellan, who, it is believed, will not let the honour
of his country suffer....</p>
<p>By the mistake of a newspaper correspondent it has been reported
that Mr. Sala (who is so well known in connection with this magazine)
has returned to England. This is not the case. He is still reporting
"America in the Midst of War," and his readers would be sorry to miss
his fluent, truthful, and clear pen. His diary in America will be
published in October next. By-the-way, a writer from New York in the
<hi rend="italic">Reader</hi> plainly accuses our English
correspondents of painting white black, according to order, and the
English of being gulled and hoodwinked in their judgment of this great
struggle and of American character by these paid fibbers. This, of
course, is the old story; to all English travellers, from Basil Hall,
Mrs. Trollope, and Charles Dickens, to Mrs. Trollope's son and
Dr. Mackay, we have heard long ago that immense sums have been paid
for the purpose of abusing America, but by whom? It does appear to us
that these gentlemen could have made, if venal, quite as much money by
writing up everything <hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi>. Let us
hope that some English author will give this slander an indignant
denial. Of Mr. Sala's letters we may say, honestly, that, without
reference to depth of view or method of treatment, we have heard
dwellers in America--nay, Americans themselves--attest their
photographic truth....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>impartial observers of the affairs of
America, who for our present purpose may be defined as those who
desire to see peace restored to that distracted continent, have
recently perceived a gleam of hope in that direction. Without adopting
too sanguine a view of the situation, it may at least be said that
some things tend to show that there is a chance that negotiation will
take the place of armed arbitrament, and that an attempt will be made
to bring about a solution of the dispute between the North and the
South. It has all along been well understood that Mr. Lincoln, in his
character as President of the Federal States, was the representative
of a war policy. He himself laid down his principle, in his own homely
phrase, and probably with the intention of reducing it to the simplest
form, when he said that all that was to be done, so far as he was to
influence affairs, was to "keep pegging away." It was a very obvious
deduction from this fact, that if the President were to receive the
honour of re-election it would amount to a declaration on the part of
the North in favour of a continuance of the war for another term of
four years, or to the point of exhaustion on both sides, if that point
should be reached within a less period than that to which the next
tenure of the presidential office would extend. A proposition,
therefore, which has for its object the withdrawal of the candidature
of Mr. Lincoln, may be accepted as an indication of a change of
opinion in the North, or in that portion of the people of the North
who are practically the governing class. Few of us in this country
exactly understand the force of certain political influences in
America; but of late we have been led to suppose that the nomination
of a candidate for the office of President at a convention to be held
at Chicago was to be conclusive of the principles on which the coming
election was to be conducted. It appears that the decision which is
likely to be come to by this body is a rejection of the claims of
Mr. Lincoln, and the nomination of a person who represents the
opinions of the party which under the name of Democrat, while holding
fast by the principle of the preservation of the Union, yet desires to
see that object attained by peaceful means, and therefore is in favour
of at least a suspension of the war. In this country a declaration of
a political league, even at Manchester, could not summarily decide a
great national question; but, according to opinions and statements
which are just now prevalent, the vote of the Chicago convention will
go far to turn the tide of sentiment in the North towards peace, and
it is said that Americans are embracing the new policy of negotiation
almost as eagerly as they adopted that of war.</p>
<p>However this feeling may prevail, it is not to be supposed that the
Federals have yet yielded, even in idea, the question of Southern
independence or have given up all hope of the restoration of the
Union. The utmost that it can be assumed that they have ceded is that
at present seccession is not to be put an end to by war; and that
hostilities may be laid aside pending an effort at negotiation,
without prejudice to another and future appeal to arms. Without taking
for granted--for the fact is one by no means to be assumed--that the
North is actuated by any notion of proximate exhaustion, it may be
supposed that a cessation of the flow of blood and treasure which has
been going on so long would not be unwelcome to the Federals; and,
looking to the military situation, an armistice would by no means
operate to the ultimate detriment of the North with reference to any
renewal of hostilities. It is possible--indeed, probable--that a
temporary lull in the storm of battle is all that will issue out of
negotiations. If the South should refuse to re-enter the Union upon
any terms, it is very questionable whether the North would submit to
acknowledge secession; and the only alternative would be a recurrence
to the attitude of belligerents.</p>
<p>While admitting a doubt of a favourable result arising out of the
new phase into which the question of North and South is presumed to
have entered, we, who have uniformly urged peace and a restoration of
at least the outward and visible signs of peace and goodwill between
those who are brethren by nationality, if not wholly by race, cannot
fail to state our earnest desire that there is truth in the rumours to
which we have referred of a tendency towards a policy of negotiation
in America. It is the first time in the whole of this contest that we
have seen any signs of the coming of the rainbow through the clouds of
broil and battle; and most heartily shall we hail its appearance. If
there exist amongst the Federal party the sagacity which is at this
moment attributed to them, and which leads them to see that a
combination of circumstances which are sufficiently obvious, but which
it is not necessary to wound Northern susceptibilities by specifying,
have arisen, which gives fair opportunity for putting a stop to the
effusion of kindred blood, we trust it may not be exercised in
vain. The Americans are as often actuated by impulse as by any other
motive, and if now they are yielding to an impulse which carries them
towards an attempt to restore peace to their country, even the cynics
of the world will forgive them any deficiency in dignity which may
seem to attach to them because they have not been influenced by some
high-wrought notion of abstract principle.</p></div2>

<p>Important news, political as well as military, has been received by
the Asia, which brings New York telegrams to the morning of the 3rd
inst.</p>
<p>The Chicago Convention has nominated M'Clellan for President, and
Pendleton, of Ohio, for Vice President. The "platform" adopted is
that, while the Union shall be maintained, efforts shall be made to
bring about a cessation of hostilities and a convention of the
States.</p>
<p>At Mobile Fort Morgan surrendered, with 600 prisoners, on the 23rd
ult., after twenty-four hours' bombardment by the Federal land and and
sea forces. The Confederates spiked the cannon and destroyed all other
material in the fort previous to the surrender.</p>
<p>Another Federal success is the occupation of Atlanta. Secretary
Stanton reports that one corps of Sherman's army had entered the
place. Sherman had been previously moving on to the Macon Railroad,
which had been cut by Kilpatrick. Hood, finding communications
destroyed, seems to have moved southward, when a battle ensued on the
Macon-road, in which it is said the Federals were successful.</p>
<p>At the other great point of interest in the struggle (Petersburg)
there had also been active work going on, rather unfavourable to the
Federals, however. On the 25th ult. the Confederates attacked General
Hancock's position on the south of the Reams Station on the Weldon
Railroad, and, after a desperate fight, retook four of the seven miles
of the line which the Federals had occupied. The Federal loss is
estimated at 2000 men and nine guns, while that of the Confederates is
said to amount to 5000 men. Mr. Stanton reports that if General Grant can be
reinforced by 100,000 new troops the success of his movements for the
capture of Richmond will be made certain.</p>
<p>There are conflicting reports respecting the state of affairs in
the Shenandoah Valley. One account represents Early to have retreated
and Sheridan to have started in pursuit. A later telegram, however,
says that the two armies were still confronting each other.</p>
<p>Gold at last accounts was quoted at 240 3/8.</p>
<p>The Minister Plenipotentiary from the Government of the Emperor
Maximilian had arrived in Washington.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Thayer, of Boston, and the family of the late Thomas
Tileston, of New York have each presented 25,000 dols. to the
Washington University of St. Louis. In consequence of these munificent
gifts the professorship of Mechanics and Civil Engineers is to be
called the Thayer Professorship, and that of Political Economy the
Tileston Professorship.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Extradition Of Muller.</hi></p>
<p>On the 27th ult., the hearing of the extradition case of
M&#xFC;ller, charged with the murder of Mr. Briggs, was resumed
before the United States Commissioner Newton. The British Government
was represented by Mr. F. F. Marbury, as on the previous day; while
Messrs. Chauncey Schaffer and E. Blankman appeared for the
prisoner. The court was thronged with spectators anxious to obtain a
view of the accused, who sat with an unmoved
countenance. Mr. Schaffer, for the defence, maintained that as yet
there was nothing to justify M&#xFC;ller's committal. The accused
being a foreigner, he contended that the treaty under which the
extradition was demanded had been suspended, and he also adverted to
the Florida as being a pirate sent out by English subjects. Inspector
Tanner having been re-examined as to the height of the prisoner,
Mr. Schaffer endeavoured to show that M&#xFC;ller could not be one
of the two men seen in the compartment with Mr. Briggs on the night of
the murder. Commissioner Newton then delivered his decision, stating
that, under the circumstances, he was constrained to grant a
certificate, and commit the prisoner, being satisfied as to his
guilt.</p>
<p>M&#xFC;ller was given into the custody of Inspector Tanner, and
left New York on the 3rd inst., in the Etna, which will, no doubt,
arrive in England before this Number is in our readers'
hands.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...Talking about oratory, what a display was that in New York the
other day on the extradition case of Herr Franz M&#xFC;ller! How
admirably logical was Mr. Chauncey Shaffer, who, we are told, once
drew and discharged a pistol at the presiding Judge, just to bring him
to a speedy and pleasant decision on the side of the irate counsel!
What a great deal of "buncombe" the American populace will bear!
Because, forsooth, an American counsel chooses to assert that England
and the United States are in a "mixed and unsolemn state of war" a
man, in whose possession the hat and watch of a murdered man were
found, and to whom his watch-chain was traced, and whose own coat
sleeve was wet with blood, is not to be given up to stand a fair
trial! Even the Commissioner hesitated, and "wished" he could only
deny the prisoner and set the policemen at defiance, and alas! felt
"constrained" to give the man up!</p>
<p>...There was, some time ago, a pretty little paragraph in the
American papers, which our own journals extracted as a specimen of
ghastly ingenuity. It was simply a calculation of how many miles of
dead bodies, piled to the height of twenty-five feet, and being
thirty-five feet thick, could be made out of those slain in the "great
rebellion," as they call their civil war, appropriating, by-the-way, a
name which Lord Clarendon two hundred years ago had made our own. The
next step in this arithmetical exercise was to assert that
"seventy-five thousand tons of human blood had been spilled on Dixie's
soil," a fact of which another American paper disposes of by saying,
supposing, then, a million of men have "spilled" more or less of that
fluid, they would have averaged the loss of about nineteen gallons a
piece! Considering the fate of he "Arithmetical Copperhead" who made
the fallacious calculation above, we, with fear and trembling, call
the attention of those who are about to emigrate to the State of taxes
in the North, as they will be and are. "On the National Debt of Great
Britain," says the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi>, "the yearly
interest payable is 1 for 262 dollars of property; but for America,
whose property is very much less, it is 1 for every 101 dollars, or
more than two and one half times larger than the debt of Great
Britain; and when they come to reckon the difference of the currency,
with gold at 250, our debt, says the calculator, will be relatively
six times larger than the debt of Great Britain! Now, this is a pretty
state of matters to have arrived at in three short years. Surely one
may quote Hamlet here, and say that, if this makes the foolish stare,
it cannot but make the judicious grieve. Great indebtedness on the
part of America, with only one moiety to pay the taxes, for the
property of the South is included in the above calculation, means the
almost total exclusion of English goods and commerce for many years to
come; and the worst of it is that the expenses are still running on,
and, so far as we can see, there is little, if anything, done to stop
them....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ENLISTMENT OF IRISH AND GERMAN EMIGRANTS ON
THE<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Battery, At New York.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>Engraving (from a sketch by
Mr. C. D. Shanly, of New York) gives a fair idea of the scene which
may be witnessed any day in that city, where the most strenuous
efforts are now made to draw foreigners to the
recruiting-offices. Castle Garden--once a popular place of amusement,
and famous because within its walls Jenny Lind first sang before an
American audience--has for several years past been used as a harbour
of refuge for newly-arrived emigrants from all parts of Europe. Close
by it, on the piece of ground known as the Battery, a large
recruiting-station has just been established. Immense placards, in
English and German, calling for men to serve in the army and navy of
the United States, are displayed on the walls of the buildings, and
the tempting sum of 600 dollars is offered to the wavering emigrants
to induce them to enlist. But this sum of 600 dollars is in paper,
not in gold; so that, with the existing depreciation of the United
States currency, it is worth but little more than one third of that
amount. It may be owing to this that the recruiting officers on the
Battery do not appear to be doing a very brisk business among the
emigrants. On the occasion of our Artist's last visit to the place
there were a good many Germans and Irish loitering around, but he did
not remark any great display of military ardour among them. No drink
stronger than lemonade is allowed to be dispensed at Castle Garden,
and a tall Irishman was observed wincing under the application of that
mild acid, with which a dyspeptic-looking soldier was trying to
convert him into food for powder. Whisky-punch would have been more to
the purpose. The German women--bronzed, buxom lasses, for the most
part, in jaunty hats and feathers--look very sharp after their young
men, interfering sadly between them and the insinuating sergeants. The
fifes and drums on the roof of the principal recruiting-office are
like reminiscences of Richardson's Booth. They have no attractions for
the Germans, at least, who are accustomed to better music at home. In
the foreground of the Engraving we observe a self-possessed boy, with
but few clothes upon him. He is a type of the unaccountable young
gentleman peculiar to all American crowds--hatless, shoeless, almost
nude, but always provided with the contingent remainder of a cigar,
and evidently quite aware that there is no legal barrier between him
and the Presidential chair at the White House.</p></div2>

<p>We have news, by the Jura and the Edinburgh, from New York to the
10th inst.</p>
<p>It was rumoured in New York that Mobile had surrendered to Admiral
Farragut, and that the Confederate garrison had withdrawn into the
interior; but the rumour proceeded from Confederate deserters who had
come over to General Grant's army, and must be received with
circumspection. It was, however, known in New York that Admiral
Farragut had succeeded in blowing up the steamer Nashville, which the
Confederates had sunk in the channel over Dog River Bar.</p>
<p>General Sherman's report of the capture of Atlanta, Georgia, has
been published. Sherman withdrew on the 30th ult. from around Atlanta
and reached a point to strike the Macon-road; Howard, with the right,
being near Jonesboro'; Schofield, with the left, near Rough and Ready;
and Thomas, with the centre, at Couch's. The Federals, finding the
enemy at Jonesboro', intrenched themselves. Sherman, meeting with
strong opposition along the road, advanced his left and centre to the
railroad, and broke it from Rough and Ready down to Howard's left,
near Jonesboro'. By the same movement Sherman interposed his army
between Atlanta and that portion of the enemy intrenched at
Jonesboro'. There Sherman made a general attack upon the enemy,
capturing their works, ten guns, and 1000 prisoners. The Confederates
retreated south during the night, Sherman following them to their
lines, near Lovejoy's Station. Hood, at Atlanta, finding Sherman on
his only road of supply, and between him and part of his army,
retreated during the night from Atlanta after blowing up the
magazines. The 20th Corps of the Federal army then occupied the city,
General Sherman reported, on the 7th inst., that he had pursued
General Hood's army to the rear of Lovejoy's Station, thirty miles
south of Atlanta, and had there found the Confederates, intrenched. He
had consequently withdrawn to Atlanta, as the great object of his
campaign, the capture of that city, had been attained. The fruits of
his successful operations, during which he had lost 1500 men, were
twenty-seven guns and 3000 prisoners.</p>
<p>President Lincoln ordered a day of thanksgiving (kept on Sunday,
the 11th inst.) for the victories at Atlanta and Mobile, and tendered
his thanks to Admiral Farragut and General Sherman. Salutes were
ordered in honour of the victories.</p>
<p>General Early was, at the latest accounts, still confronting
General Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>It is stated that General Lee had drawn large reinforcements from
Early and had concentrated a great force for the purpose of attacking
General Grant's left. Indeed, according to both Federal and Confederate
accounts, both Grant and Lee were concentrating their forces about
Petersburg, and it is believed that a great battle for the possession
of the Weldon Railway was imminent. A letter has been written by Grant
declaring that the Confederates have in their ranks their last man,
and that, if the North continue undivided, the end of the war is not
far distant.</p>
<p>General Gillam has surprised and killed the guerrilla General
Morgan, at Greenville, Tennessee, capturing his staff.</p>
<p>The draught in New York and Brooklyn will not take place.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan has accepted the nomination of the Chicago
Convention. He declares for the Union at all hazards, and says a
spirit of conciliation and compromise must be exercised, but union is
the one condition of peace. Any State willing to return to the Union
should be received at once, with full constitutional rights. A large
enthusiastic meeting for the ratification of ratification of
M'Clellan's nomination to the presidency has been held in New
York.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward made a speech at Auburn, New York, recently, in
which he declared that the salvation of the Union depends upon the
election of Mr. Lincoln; that slavery is no longer an issue of the
war, and will not be interfered with after peace is restored; and that
the Democratic party is aiding and abetting the rebellion. He also stated
that no draught will be necessary, as the armies are recruited as
rapidly as required by volunteering.</p>
<p>It is reported that General Fremont has withdrawn his name as
presidential candidate.</p>
<p>There had been extraordinary fluctuations and a great decline in
the premium on gold at New York; and the last quotation was
228.</p></div2>

<p>We have telegraphic news from New York, by way of Cape race, to the
20th ult.</p>
<p>General Sheridan has defeated General Early, with heavy loss, in
the Shenandoah Valley. At an early hour on the morning of the 18th
ult. the Federals attacked the Confederates, and there ensued a
furious battle, which lasted the whole day. The result was that
General Early was defeated, and was compelled to retreat up the
Shenandoah Valley, with the loss of five guns, 2500 prisoners, and
5000 men killed or wounded, including Generals Gordon and Shalder. The
victorious Federals, whose loss was heavy and one of whose Generals
was killed, afterwards occupied Winchester.</p>
<p>A Washington paper asserts that Admiral Farragut will not attack
Mobile with his gun-boats. Southern papers publish rumours that the
gallant Admiral is about to turn his attention to Wilmington.</p>
<p>There is no news of the movements of either of the armies at
Petersburg beyond a statement that the Confederate cavalry had made a
raid into Grant's lines, near Harrison's Landing, and had driven off
2500 head of cattle.</p>
<p>On the 16th ult. General Grant arrived at Washington, for the
purpose, it may be supposed, of calling on the Government for
reinforcements, as Secretary Stanton had since ordered the draught to
take place on the 19th in all the States which had not furnished their
quota. Mr. Seward's assertion at Auburn that no draught would be
required was therefore not correct.</p>
<p>General Sherman has determined to make Atlanta an exclusively
military post. He therefore ordered all citizens to leave the place
within ten days, and go North or South, as they might prefer. General
Hood, while protesting against the order, agreed to a truce for ten
days to carry it out. "Permit me to say," he writes, "that the
unprecedented measure you propose transcends in studied and iniquitous
cruelty all the acts ever brought to my attention in this dark history
of war. In the name of God and humanity, I protest against it,
believing that you are expelling from their homes the wives and
children of a brave people." The Southern papers express their
indignation in no measured terms. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond
Sentinel</hi> speaks of the order as "an event unparalleled in the
American war." After calling Sherman "the chief among savages, the
captain among pirates, the leader among highwaymen, the prince among
scoundrels and brutes, and the foremost villain of the world," the
editor calls upon the<pb n="327"/> people, if any are left, to come
out and make the war, "horrible as it has been, still more so." He
says, "No matter about age now. The last man and the last boy must
take his musket sooner than endure such outrages as that at
Atlanta."</p>
<p>The Federal despatch-boat Fawn, while on the passage from Norfolk
to Roanoke Island, was captured and burnt by the Confederates on the
9th ult.</p>
<p>Vallandigham, Wood, and other leaders of the Peace Democracy had
renounced M'Clellan, and were expected to hold a meeting shortly to
determine what course they should take. Meanwhile the Republican
ticket has been elected in Maine. The Southern papers prefer
Mr. Lincoln to General M'Clellan on all grounds.</p>
<p>The New York Democratic State Convention have nominated Mr. Seymour
for Governor.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi> professes to see a way
by which peace may be brought about. Its plan is to make North and
South one nation so far as all foreign nations are concerned, by an
offensive and defensive treaty, but with separate governments for
domestic affairs.</p>
<p>The three Judges of the Supreme Court of Nevada territory have
resigned, after being charged with corruption by the press, and
petitioned by nearly 40,000 votes to vacate the benches.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Pickets Before Petersburg.</hi>--The
special correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>,
writing from "in front of Petersburg," on the 5th ult.,
says:--"Knowing perfectly their own resources and strength, our army
can afford to dally, in a measure, with the enemy. Hence the more than
usual sociability, at the present time, of the opposing pickets. On
the right, I understand, they sit on the opposite ends of the same log
and discuss the war and the peace question. Some are not quite so
sociable. The other day one of our officers, in stationing his
pickets, said to one of them, 'Well, sit down on the end of that log
there for the present, until you get the lay of the land a little, and
see what is going on,' and then went on stationing his
detail. Presently the seated picket heard a rustling through the
bushes at the other end of the log, and a voice at the same time
asking, 'Is that you, Yank?' On being answered affirmatively, that it
was 'nobody else,' Reb replied, 'Well, I guess we are getting a little
too close together; I will withdraw a little,' suiting the action to
the word. On another occasion two cooks in Colonel Stevens's Brigade,
18th Army Corps, in taking dinner to their comrades in the trenches,
took the wrong by-path and brought up in the camp of the enemy. They
were relieved of the dinner and sent to Richmond, and word sent back
to our pickets by the dinner-eaters that they would be very much
obliged for another such meal. The other evening word was given out to
our pickets by the Rebs that some ladies had come down from Richmond,
and that there was to be a prayer-meeting in the rebel camp, and some
of our boys were invited over, but they failed to 'see it.' On this
part of the line in some places the opposing forces get water out of
the same springs, and the pickets traffic more or less in newspapers
and other commodities. This intercourse and traffic seem to be carried
on perhaps even more persistently and extensively, though a little
differently, at some places on the left. The pickets have an agreement
not to fire on each other without due notice, but it is understood
that all captures by main strength or superior numbers are
legitimate. This makes the pickets somewhat shy of each other, and
consequently the most of their traffic is carried on in writing. They
have a neutral post between their lines--a stump, for instance--where
notes of negotiation and commodities of exchange are mutually left. A
note or two of the rebel pickets that I have seen will more fully
explain the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi</hi>:--'Please leave the
worth of this (a plug of tobacco) in writing-paper, with two
envelopes. I will give you two plugs of tobacco for the knife.'
'Please mail this letter (an open letter) to my mother, in
Kentucky. Put on one of your stamps, and here is one of ours and a
piece of tobacco in return. What's the chance to get some coffee of
you?' These notes, with or without the article referred to, as the
case may be, are left at the nearest post, while the person leaving
them retires, and the other person comes up and examines them and
replies; and so the traffic goes on. Sometimes the bargain and
exchange are made in person, without the trouble of notes. One of the
pickets told me that during one of the fiercest of the Weldon Railroad
fights the pickets on a portion of the lines near by, not immediately
engaged, were driving a brisk trade in tobacco, note-paper,
&#x0026;c. Besides this petty trafficking, not a little frank
conversation on the state of affairs is known to be carried on between
the more intelligent soldiers on picket."</p></div2>

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Testimonies Concerning Slavery</hi>. By M. D,
Conway. (1 vol. Chapman and Hall.) Testimony for or against slavery
can have little interest for the majority of Englishmen now. Some
years ago they declared it to be infamous, and paid twenty millions to
be quit of the disgrace. And John Bull is said not to part easily with
his money; to patiently bear the stings of conscience rather than open
his purse-strings. We may, therefore, consider it pretty certain that
John Bull abhors slavery and is convinced of its heinousness; and if
he reads the high-spiced stories of Mrs. Henry Beecher Stowe, it is to
gratify his morbid tastes and not to satisfy his calm judgment. There
may be still an insignificant minority who believe that slavery is the
fore-ordained condition of the negro; that God--contrary to express
declaration in the Scriptures--is a respecter of persons, preferring a
sinful white man to a pious black man; and that woolly hair, ebony
skin, protuberance of heel, and a peaceful, cheerful, grateful
disposition reduce a human being from a man to a chattel. To them,
also, testimony for or against slavery can be of little interest; they
resemble the headstrong unbelievers of whom it was said, "If they hear
not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one
rose from the dead;" if they hear not Clarkson, Brougham, and
Mrs. Stowe, neither will they be persuaded by Mr. Conway. And yet
Mr. Conway speaks with more than usual authority; he is a Virginian, a
ci-devant Secessionist, and the son of a slaveholder; his father was
one of the kind masters, and yet his slaves were delighted to
escape. The most interesting portions of Mr. Conway's book are those
in which he gives an account of how he assisted his father's slaves to
escape through Baltimore about a year and a half ago, in which he
combats the opinion that "the negro is more despised and maltreated in
the North than in the South," in which he treats of amalgamation, and
in which he considers what prospect of success the North has in the
present sanguinary strife. His recapitulation of the horrors attendant
upon slavery were, in our judgment, unnecessary; and how far he was
justified in assisting his father's slaves to escape we do not care to
argue; we put down whatever value is attached to his book to the fact
that it is the production of a heretofore Secessionist from Virginia,
who boldly announces his views concerning the origin and probable
result of the conflict now raging on the American continent....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN AMERICA.<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Great M'Clellan Meeting In Union-Square, New
York.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. C. D. Shanly</hi>, of New York, whose
sketch of an open-air political meeting in that city we have this week
engraved, writes, under date of Sept. 9, as follows:--"The nomination
of General M'Clellan by the Chicago Convention for the office of
President of the United States was ratified last evening in this city
by an immense <sic corr="Democratic">Democatic</sic> 'mass meeting' in Union-square. This meeting
was called in the name of 'the friends of M'Clellan, in favour of free
speech, a free press, and the rights of the people, and all who hope
in peace and reunion.' Five large stands were erected on the south
side of the square, and from these, which were brilliantly lighted
with Chinese lanterns, the orators of the night, surrounded by their
friends, held forth for some hours to the assembled multitude. The
German stand was placed close by the statue of Washington, and at this
point the scene was very striking. A powerful calcium light had been
placed in a distant part of the square in such a position as to
concentrate its rays upon the bronze statue, illuminating it almost to
whiteness, and projecting its shadow, sharp and black as a <hi rend="italic">silhouette</hi>, upon the buildings behind. Sometimes a
skyrocket would curve high up against the dark sky, and, bursting
directly over the statue, descend upon it in a shower of sparks; at
which the honest Germans, who are great M'Clellan men just now--would
grasp each other by the hands, accepting the omen as one favourable to
their nominee. The meeting was of a most enthusiastic character,
indicating a considerable degree of popular faith in the new candidate
for the presidency. I send with this a Sketch of the scene described
above. The boys that figure in it are trading in M'Clellan badges,
which they dispose of at fifteen cents apiece. A terrible accident
occurred in the course of the evening, by the bursting of one of the
calcium lights, which caused the death of at least two persons,
fearfully scorching and maiming several others."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In </hi>a little brown and somewhat scandalous
book written by the Abbot Gualdi, which purports to be "The History of
Donna Olympia, who Governed the Church during the Time of Innocent
X.," there is a story which will very readily fit the head of our
excellent and venerably-juvenile Premier and the attitude in which he
keeps John Bull during the American war. Two porters, it would seem,
were at fisticuffs under the Pope's windows, and some were there who
would have parted them, but the Pope forbad it, and the men, having
fought till they were tired, made peace without any
intercession. "Then the Pope, turning to Panzicolo, who stood by him,
said, 'So will the French and Spaniards do when they are weary of
beating one another; they will agree of themselves without help or
importunity of others.' " "And indeed," says Gualdi, "he prophesied
truly, for in a little time we saw them do so." In a little time, let
us hope, we shall see the severed halves of the Union agree.  The
Richmond papers urge a peace between the confederacies, and a
union--an armed union--"which shall bid defiance to the world." It is
curiously indicative of the "cocky" character of "U. S.," either North
or South, that he is always defying the world. "So have we seen"--as
dear old Jeremy Taylor has it, in the commencement of most of his
golden sentences--so have we seen two bantams, with torn combs and
bleeding wattles, with open beaks, panting and distressed, and plumage
ragged and dishevelled, separate in mutual exhaustion, and, mounting
each his respective dunghill, crow loudly in proof of the victory of
each. Such seems now to us the probable end of the war. M'Clellan has
proved--as if we needed it--how slippery a seat two stools make. The
peace men utterly reject him, and the victories which at last seem to
crown the Federal cause have probably completed the defeat, not of the
Confederate cause, but of that of General M'Clellan which some time
ago looked so hopeful....</p></div2>

<p>We have details of the action fought in the Shenandoah Valley
between the Federals under General Sheridan and the Confederates under
General Early. The following despatch is from General Sheridan
himself, dated the 20th ult., the day after the battle:--</p>
<q><p>General,--We fought early from daylight till between six and
seven o'clock p.m. We drove him from Opequan Creek, through
Winchester, and beyond the town. We captured 2500 to 3000 prisoners,
five pieces of artillery, nine battle-flags, and all the rebel wounded
and dead. Their wounded in Winchester amount to some 3000. We lost, in
killed, General David Russell, commanding a division of the 6th Army
Corps, and in wounded, Generals Chapman, M'Intosh, and Upton. The
rebels lost in killed the following general officers--General Rhodes,
General Wharton, General Gordon, and General Ramseur. We have just
seen them whirling through Winchester, and we are after them
to-morrow. This army behaved splendidly.</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">P. H. Sheridan</hi>,
Major-General Commanding.</p>
<p>P.S. I am sending forward all the medical supplies, subsistence
stores, and ambulances.</p></q>
<p>A correspondent of a New York journal gives the following outline
of this important incident of the war:--</p>
<q><p>The Federal General formed his infantry forces in four lines of
battle, about 300 yards apart, and, everything being in readiness, the
advance was sounded about twelve o'clock. The corps advanced in
splendid style, and just as composedly as though marching at a review
or on parade, drums beating and colours flying. The first line had not
advanced more than 200 yards before it became warmly engaged with the
enemy, who were posted in line about 600 yards distant. At the same
time our artillery opened a furious cannonade, throwing shells and
solid shot into the opposite woods, where the enemy could be
distinctly seen moving up reinforcements, Our different lines of
battle continued to advance steadily until within nearly 200 yards of
the enemy's line, when the rebels opened a furious cannonade with
grape and canister from two batteries which they had previously kept
secreted, and which ploughed through our advancing lines, mowing down
large numbers of our men. The first line was obliged to give way under
so murderous a fire, and in retreating behind the second line, threw
it into momentary confusion, and it also was obliged to fall back
behind the third line, which had in the mean time been ordered to lie
down, in order to avoid as much as possible the effects of the
withering fire from the enemy's batteries. The artillery was now
brought up and posted in commanding positions to silence those
batteries of the enemy which had caused us so much annoyance, and our
line was re-formed and again moved forward, regaining the advanced
position. Precisely at three o'clock General Crook formed his
division, rode along the lines, and was received with most vociferous
cheering, the men promising to go in and wipe out Winchester. General
Sheridan, after a consultation as to the part the cavalry were to
take, ordered a final charge along the whole line, which was made with
an impetuosity which nothing could resist. Our line, extending nearly
three miles in length, advanced amid cheers and yells which could be
distinctly heard far above the noise caused by the thunder of the
artillery and continuous roar of musketry, which, for its impetuosity,
has seldom been exceeded in any battle of this war. As our lines
advanced closer and closer to those of the enemy the battle became
more and more fierce, until, in point of desperate and fierce carnage,
it will compare favourably with any similar contest of the war. The
slaughter was truly awful. At every discharge men could be distinctly
seen dropping all around, and the two contending lines at some points
could not have been over 200 yards apart. Just at this critical
period, above the roar of artillery, musketry, and cheers, and the
fierce yells of the contending armies, could be heard the shrill notes
of the cavalry bugle, sounding the charge which was the death-knell
to Early's army. There could be seen the gallant Custer and Merritt,
each with head-quarters flag in hand, and conspicuous among the
advancing squadrons, gallantly leading the charge which, in connection
with the desperate charge of our infantry, secured us the victory. The
stubborn columns of Early 's command were forced to give way and break
before the fierce onslaught which our cavalry made upon them, who,
with sabre in hand, rode them down, cutting them right and left,
capturing 721 privates and non-commissioned officers, with nine
battle-flags and two guns. The broken and disorganised divisions
comprising Early's command now fled in confusion, throwing away
everything which could in any way impede their flight and strewing the
ground with their arms. Some made for the heights of Winchester, but
they were speedily dislodged by Averill, and forced to beat a hasty
and ignominious retreat up the valley, where such of Early's command
as are left him are now scattered.</p></q><pb n="351"/>
<p>The President has appointed General Sheridan a Brigadier-General in
the regular army, and assigned him to the prominent command of the
Middle Military Division.</p>
<p>General Grant ordered the army under his command to fire a salute
of 100 guns in honour of Sheridan's victory.</p>
<p>A correspondent from General Sherman's army says that the Whitworth
rifle in use by the Southern skirmishers and sharpshooters is a weapon
greatly to be feared, as persons nearly a mile and a half from the
Confederate skirmish line have been wounded when they thought
themselves safe from anything except solid shot and shell. One soldier
was standing upon a log crossing a creek, about one mile and a quarter
from the nearest Confederate line of rifle-pits, and a comrade was
talking with him, when one of these fatal messengers came crashing
through both thighs, and with this mortal wound he sank into the
water. An officer, speaking of it, says--"They break the bone of a
man's limb like a solid shot from a cannon." Deserters say that each
division of the Confederate front is furnished with about fifty of
these rifles, which are used in their skirmish line.</p>
<p>The M'Clellan ratification meetings at New York, Washington, and
throughout the North, have been great successes. Great enthusiasm was
manifested.</p></div2>

<p>The following telegram has been received through Mr. Reuter's
office:--</p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="right">Arrival of the Pennsylvania (via Crookhaven).</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, Sept. 23 (Evening).--After the
battle near Winchester, Sheridan pursued Early beyond Strasburg, and
again attacked him at Fisher's Hill. Sheridan's report states that the
right of the Confederate army rested on the north fork of the
Shenandoah, extending across Strasburg Valley westward to the North
Mountain, and occupying apparently an impregnable position. After much
man&#x153;uvering, Crook's command was transferred to the extreme
right of the line of the North Mountain and attacked the enemy's left,
carrying everything before him. Whilst Crook drove away the enemy and
swept down behind their breastworks, the 6th and 19th Corps attacked
the rebel works in front, and the whole army appeared to be broken
up. They fled in the utmost confusion, and sixteen guns were
captured. The darkness only saved Early's army from total
destruction. On Thursday night Sheridan pushed on down the Shenandoah
Valley. Two divisions of cavalry went down Luray Valley. Sheridan says
if they push on to the main valley the result of the engagement will
be more signal.</p>
<p>Correspondents' letters assert that Early's loss in prisoners in
the first day's fight will approximate to 5000. Among the killed and
wounded were Confederate Generals Rhodes, Ramson, Gordon, Terry,
Goodwin, Bradley, Johnson and Fitzhugh Lee. The Federal loss in the
same battle is estimated at between 2000 and 4000 men.</p>
<p>General Sherman is strongly fortifying Atlanta.</p>
<p>General Price has crossed the Arkansas River for an invasion of
Missouri. General Shelby is co-operating. The Missouri militia
retreated before Shelby from Charleston to White Water River.</p>
<p>Fremont and Cochrane have withdrawn from the presidential

Lincoln's request.</p>

"utterances," literary or verbal, that may tend to embitter the
relations between ourselves and our Transatlantic brethren. Without
the slightest assumption of credit to this Journal for having done
anything beyond its duty in abstaining from cynical or hostile comment
upon the frightful struggle in the West, we may fairly assert that at
no period of the war have we permitted ourselves to be irritated into
printing aught that, on its re-perusal when the contest shall be over,
can properly give offence to American readers. We could heartily wish
that partisans on both sides would remember that the exasperating
interference of bystanders in a quarrel is much more slowly forgiven
by combatants than the wrongs which each supposes himself to have
sustained from his enemy.</p>
<p>It would be absurd to deny that the supposed weakness of the
Confederates, and the gallant fight which they have made against a
force which England no less than the North originally believed would
be irresistible, have enlisted on the side of the South a very large
share of British sympathy. Nearly all the leading newspapers of this
country have seemed delighted to chronicle the successes of the
Confederates, to make the most of the deeds of their Generals, and to
speak slightingly of the efforts of the Unionists. Journals which at
the outset of the war described the resistance of the South as
hopeless, and were almost as ready as Mr. Seward himself to fix dates
for the utter subjugation of the "rebels," have long abandoned that
view of the disruption, and now chronicle the story of the combat with
warm admiration and treat each campaign as a new step towards Southern
independence. For all this we submit that the Federals, whatever may
be the issue of the war, will not be entitled to complain of us. They
have certainly been at least as much astonished as ourselves. When the
Sumter guns fired, it was almost impossible to believe that the mighty
nation then defied would not make short work with the separatists, and
the vindication of English journalism is to be found in the printed
despatches of American statesmen. It is clear that both London and
Washington were deceived as to the power and resolution of the South;
and it is not too much to say that could a three years' war have been
foreseen it would have been entered on by the North in a different
spirit from that which marked the earlier portions of the struggle. If
the Federals knew so little of the will and of the resources of
provinces with which they were in daily and hourly communication, it
was scarcely to be expected that we, at a fortnight's distance from
New York, should be better informed. We all believed that the North,
with its enormous population, its command of the sea, and its
governmental prestige, would coerce the South into speedy
submission. We were mistaken. We saw the Federals beaten in the field,
and, for a long time at least, impotent at sea; while the Confederates
grew stronger and stronger, and addressed themselves to their work
with what Northern writers call desperation, but which calmer judges
regard as the earnestness necessary to military success. The South
held its own, and holds it still; and the very fact that it does so in
the face of all the power and bravery of a gigantic enemy is an
irresistible proof that, apart from the merits of the contest, it must
have been nobly conducted by the weaker party. Hereafter, the Federals
will, we imagine, be ashamed of the language in which they have
permitted their organs to revile the Southern combatants, who have
shown themselves so worthy of the name of Americans.</p>
<p>Let it be admitted, therefore, that the English had a right to be
surprised at the events of the war. Let it be said, too, that it is an
English habit, in which we occasionally indulge to excess, to give our
sympathy to the weaker side in any quarrel. A small nation gallantly
struggling against a great one is almost certain to find favour in
England, almost without reference to the original quarrel. And there
is no denying that the South, which at first was not thought to have a
chance, has acquitted itself nobly in this unhappy fray. If we have
given too strong expression to our admiration of the pluck of the
Confederates, we have erred; but the sentiment is not one with which
the North would, in presence of other circumstances, find much fault,
for it is too English a sentiment not to be American. But beyond this
point we have nothing to say in favour of any Englishman who has
insulted the Federal combatants. They must have fought well, or the
South needed not to have fought so hard. In fact, it would be worse
than childish to allege that the great body of the English people did
injustice to the efforts of the Federals, although the character of
the war necessarily attracted attention to the resisting rather than
to the assailing champions. If foolish words have been used amid the
excitement of so strange and ghastly a spectacle, they were assuredly
not the expression of the feelings of the people of England.</p>
<p>It is not unfair, nor is it unkind, however, at this stage of the
 war, to say that we in England had considerable provocation to speak
 somewhat frankly on American affairs. For ten years, at least,
 before the war the leading American journals were full of abuse of
 this country. We are now told, and we believe with considerable
 truth, that the greater portion of this abuse proceeded from writers
 in the pay of the slave-owners, who could never forgive England for
 having turned the tide of the world's opinion against slavery, and
 for having made it certain that the destruction of the domestic
 institution must come, sooner or later. But it was scarcely for
 England to know that the minority ruled in the United States, and
 that the cherished and applauded organs of American opinion were
 expressing only the feelings of the dealers in a certain commodity
 called human flesh. We are only too happy to learn that such is the
 truth; but we could not know it by instinct. Then the war came, and
 the Federals, not very reasonably, became enraged with us for not
 instantly understanding the whole case and joining them
 enthusiastically against their enemies. The storm of abuse
 continued; but it thundered, and rained, and hailed from a new quarter of the
 heavens. The New York people all but hanged the principal vituperator
 of this country; but as he and his accomplices preferred conversion
 to execution, they were thenceforth permitted to rail against us from
 another platform, and England was denounced as a hypocrite because
 she was not, heart and soul, for an anti-slavery war. But, unluckily
 for our assailants' logic, the war was declared by their own
 Government not to be an anti-slavery war, and, on the contrary,
 Mr. Lincoln repeatedly offered to put the domestic institution on a
 firmer footing than ever for those who would abandon the idea of
 independence. Consequently, what could England, herself anti-slavery
 to the backbone, do but remain neutral, and leave the combatants to
 settle what it was that they were fighting for. Now, in the fourth
 year of the war, the question is yet unsettled, for a large part of
 the sovereigns of America are for the Union at any price, while
 another large portion will have no Union without the extinction of
 slavery. And, up to the very last mails, England is still abused and
 menaced for a neutrality which has been sternly preserved under the
 most difficult circumstances which ever complicated the relations of
 those who ought to be the firmest friends.</p><pb n="355"/>
<p>But, all this said, simply as a record of fact, scarcely as an
extenuation of any acerbity on the part of the English press, we
revert to our original protest against any bitter words touching the
American struggle. Let us try to be as impartial in language as we
have been in act; let us do all we can towards humanising a
fratricidal war, and let us write nothing in the hour of strife which
we shall regret to read in the hour of peace. Soon may it
strike!</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from New York to the 1st inst.</p>
<p>The quietude about Petersburg has been broken. It is announced that
General Grant's army had undertaken important operations both on the
north and south banks of the James River, though their scope and
result are not yet very clear. It appears from Grant's report that, on
the morning of the 20th ult., General Ord's Federal corps advanced and
carried the strong fortifications of Chepin's Farm, in which he took
fifteen guns and 200 prisoners. At the same time another Federal
division moved from Deep Bottom and carried the intrenchments which
defended the Newmarket Road, scattering the enemy and taking a few
prisoners. This division afterwards advanced towards Richmond, and
arrived at a place called Junction Hill. In a subsequent report,
apparently forwarded on the evening of the 30th ult., General Grant
stated that the operations on the north side of the James River were
successful. He further added, as to his movements on the south bank,
that on the 30th ult. General Warren's corps carried the enemy's line
on the right, and was following up its successes; and that General
Meade had moved from the left and carried the enemy's lines near
Poplar Grove, while General Butler had repulsed an attack on his
lines.</p>
<p>General Sheridan had reported, apparently on the 23rd ult., that he
had pursued the defeated Confederates to Port Republic; that his
cavalry had destroyed much property at Staunton and Waynesborough, on
the Charlottesville Railway; and that General Early's army was said to
be demoralised. No official accounts later than the 26th ult. had been
received from him, as Confederate guerrillas in his rear had captured
his couriers--a strange position for a conquering army to be in. But
the Richmond journals asserted that on the 26th ult. General Sheridan
unsuccessfully attacked General Early at Broom's Gap, and that General
Early then reassumed the offensive, and drove the Federals back six
miles to Port Republic, and, it was believed, across the Shenandoah
river.</p>
<p>The position of General Sherman at Atlanta does not appear to be
quite safe. A brigade under General Martin had torn up the railway
track between Dalton and Atlanta; while General Forrest had taken the
Federal garrison at Athens, had destroyed the railroad between Decatur
and Athens, had captured two trains on the Nashville and Chattanooga
railroad, and had done more or less damage on various parts of that
railway. But it is stated that the Federal Government "felt no
apprehension concerning General Sherman's communications." Secretary
Stanton has issued a circular urging the people to promote enlistments
in order that General Sherman might be enabled to hold Atlanta and to
advance further south. General Hood was advancing towards the Alabama
line. The Southern papers state that Beauregard had been appointed to
the command of the Confederate armies in Georgia. The rumours of peace
negotiations in that State are renewed. It is said the Governor of
that State had tendered to Sherman propositions of peace, and that
that General had sent commissioners to treat with the Georgian
authorities. A Washington telegram of the 29th ult. says:--"After
careful inquiry, it cannot be ascertained that any importance is
attached in official circles to the rumoured peace propositions from
Georgia." A paper war has been raging between Generals Hood and
Sherman respecting the expulsion by the latter of the citizens of
Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Price, who was aided by Generals Kirby
Smith and Shelby, had invaded the State of Missouri at the head of
forces estimated at 30,000 men, and had advanced at least as far as
Potosi. The invasion had caused great alarm at St. Louis, where the
Federal authorities were preparing for the defence of the city; and
General Rosecranz [i.e., Rosecrans] had issued a proclamation calling the Union people
to arms, and had succeeded in raising 12,000 Missourian militia.</p>
<p>General Hooker has been appointed to command in the West.</p>
<p>President Jefferson Davis, in a speech made by him at Salisbury, in
North Carolina, declared that, although reverses had been experienced
by the Confederates, the spirit of the confederacy was unbroken; and
it would yet wring peace and independence from a hated foe. He urged
all Southern men to join the army, and all Southern women to marry no
man who shirked the duties of a soldier.</p>
<p>A mass meeting in favour of Lincoln had been held at New York.</p>
<p>General Sully is reported to have defeated the allied Indian force
of 6000 warriors in a desperate battle in Nebraska, inflicting upon
them terrible punishment.</p>
<p>After violent fluctuations, gold was quoted on the 1st inst. at
90&#xBD; premium, showing a great decline from previous prices. At
one time the premium was as low as 83.</p></div2>

officers and one hundred men, most of whom, it is alleged, served
under him in the Alabama. It is not pretended that the Laurel could
act as a cruiser, but the report goes that she will meet, at some
convenient point, a new and powerful steamer, called the Ranger, to
which she will transfer Captain Semmes and his companions, as well as
the stores which she takes out with her.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONEERING IN<lb/>NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We </hi>have engraved two sketches by
Mr. C. D. Shanly, of New York, who explains their subjects in the
following passage of his letter, dated the 18th ult.--</p>
<p>"On the night before last there was another tremendous
demonstration here in favour of M'Clellan and Pendleton for the
presidency and vice-presidency of the United States, respectively. The
railings which surround the Park of Union-square (the park is a circle
within the square) were hung everywhere with coloured lanterns, and
the ten stands erected for the speakers of the night were similarly
illuminated. The cannon seemed to be louder, and the fireworks more
brilliant and complicated, than I remember to have heard and seen at
any similar celebration here. There was an endless torchlight
procession of the M'Clellanites belonging to the several wards of the
city; and the torches, every now and then, discharged globes of fire
and showers of sparks into the air. All was a blaze of many-coloured
light, contrasting finely with the cold splendour of the moon, which
rose up very bright and clear while the scene was at its
height. Conspicuous in the procession were a number of large waggons,
draped with the national flag and hung around with Chinese lanterns
and other luminous objects. So crowded were these vehicles that they
resembled moving pyramids of acrobats. They all displayed an immense
variety of transparencies, stranger in their suggestions than
Longfellow's 'banner with a strange device;' and I noticed one of them
with a large stuffed eagle mounted over it upon rods, in a position
intended to represent the sweeping soar of that noble bird. The jokes
of Mr. Lincoln were a favourite subject for the legends upon the
transparencies--the rather grim one of 'Coal, 14 dols. per ton' being
greeted by the populace with groans as it swayed past. One of the
waggons bore the ship 'Constitution'--a good-sized vessel,
barque-rigged, and manned with a crew of young fellows in red
shirts. Passing through a dark by-street, a man on horseback galloped
past me, pulling up his horse with a jerk every few yards, and
discharging a shower of fireworks from some contrivance carried in his
hand. As he disappeared into the dark, through which he loomed up here
and there in a glory of his wildfire, he suggested the idea of a
mounted <hi rend="italic">ignis fatuus</hi>, come up from his native
swamps to contribute to the harmony of the occasion. The sentiment
throughout this demonstration was one of disgust with the war; the
feeling, that with the election of M'Clellan peace will be
restored--somehow."</p>
<p>Mr. G. A. Sala, in one of his recent letters, comments upon the
scene as follows:--"Not so many years have passed away since, in
England, a knight of the shire could not be chosen to sit in
Parliament without brass bands, flags, streamers, open carriages with
white horses, and abusive placards--without the punching of heads, the
blackening of eyes, and the phlebotomising of noses. And our cousins
at New York preserve these undoubted relics of the manners of their
fathers; but they have added to them strange accompaniments and
supplements, for many of which the Germans are responsible. Thus, a
nocturnal, outdoor mass meeting presents in its external aspect a
curious combination of Hogarth's 'Four Scenes of an Election' and a
German <hi rend="italic">Lustgarten</hi> on a holiday. And throughout
the whole giant city you will find the same odd mixture of English and
Teutonic elements of civilisation--the grog-shop grafted on to the <hi rend="italic">Gessellschaftshaus</hi>; the rowdy getting drunk on
whisky and sobering himself on lager beer; the impulsiveness of the
Yankee neutralised by the stolidity of the Dutchman. I happened to
pass through Union-square in the afternoon, and watched with great
interest the preparations for the meeting. You might have fancied that
a Cremorne f&#xEA;te was about to come off. Platforms and firework
galleries had sprung up as if by magic, horizontal beams were hung
with festoons of parti-coloured Chinese lanterns, and banners, and
transparencies, and flowery devices, as yet unlit, abounded. I came
back after dinner, when it was quite dark. The square was broken into
patches of 'brilliant coruscations of light,' and presented a really
beautiful and picturesque spectacle. Every platform was garlanded by
the Chinese lanterns I have spoken of, and the gas-lamps had, besides,
been unscrewed from their posts and hung to the sides of the
scaffolds, to give light to the reporters. There was the grand stand,
whence the great guns of the Democracy were to orate, and a number of
smaller platforms for the less shining lights, and a German stand
whence the young ravens of Fatherland could be fed with interminable
jobations ending in '<hi rend="italic">ig</hi>' and '<hi rend="italic">ert</hi>.' There was no particular Irish stand. Ireland
in the United States is everywhere. At eight o'clock artillery began
to roar from the inclosures of the square. Many brass bands then began
to bray. The 'Star-spangled Banner' blended with the waltz from
'Faust.' A big eagle in gas suddenly spread his dazzling wings over
the portal of the Maison Dor&#xE9;e. Delmonico's, which is not fifty
yards from the square, was illumined from roof to basement. The
waiters rushed about nervously. They had a heavy night before
them. The orators 'change their breath' before they speak, and sup
afterwards, The neighbouring bars were full to overflowing; the
hackney-coach horses champed in the first floors of the
livery-stables; for in this city horses go up stairs to bed, like
Christians. Small boys filled the branches of the trees; no policemen
ordered them to come down. The Broadway squad were clustered round the
different stands, while from the corner of Fourteenth-street, which is
at right angles with the square, a blinding ray from a calcium-light
apparatus shot across for many hundred feet--a bridge of
radiance. There was a splendid display of fireworks before the
procession of the 'Wards' entered the square. Rockets went whizzing
about in every direction, making one feel rather anxious as to the
particular direction in which the sticks might fall. Behind me,
watching the dark and dense groups on which from moment to moment the
lurid glow of the fireworks fell, and which were cleft in twain by
that blinding cord of calcium light, stood a knot of European
diplomatists. Sure enough, before the termination of the proceedings
on Thursday night, a pistol went off in the outskirts of the crowd,
and a young man was shot in the leg by an unknown assailant. With this
exception, the meeting passed off with the most perfect peace and
harmony. There may have been at one period 35,000 persons present, but
I did not see a blow struck nor hear an angry word spoken. There is no
mistake into which foreigners are more likely to fall than that which
assumes that the normal condition of American popular assemblages is
one of riot and confusion."</p></div2>

<p>The arrival of the North American gives us intelligence from New
York to the evening of the 8th inst.</p>
<p>The details of the battles of the 29th and 30th ult., in the
neighbourhood of Richmond, have been received, and show that the
fighting was of a more sanguinary character than was at first
reported. On the 29th ult. two Federal corps, under Generals Ord and
Birney, which had suddenly crossed from the south to the north bank of
the James River, advanced towards Richmond, and carried the works at
Chapin's Bluff and Newmarket Heights, but subsequently failed to take
a position held by the Confederates at Laurel Hill, and withdrew to
the junction of the Varina and Newmarket Roads. On the 30th ult. the
Confederates unsuccessfully attempted to retake the positions captured
by the Federals on the previous day. On the 1st inst. there was no
fighting, though a Federal reconnaissance was pushed on towards
Richmond. In these engagements the Federal correspondents put their
losses to at least 2000 men; and their black regiments, which are said
to have behaved very gallantly, suffered especially great
losses. Active operations on the south of the James River did not
commence before the 30th ult., on which day two Federal corps
advanced, on the extreme left of the Federal lines, and carried some
Confederate positions, but were ultimately stopped by a strong line of
defences. On the 1st inst. the Federals advanced a little farther, but
then halted, as they found the Confederates behind earthworks which it
was not prudent to assault. The Confederates still held positions
covering the Southside Railway and the road by which they communicate
with the Weldon Railway, and their defences were too formidable to be
easily stormed. In these actions on the south of the James River the
Federal correspondents admit losses amounting to more than 2000 men,
of whom more than half were made prisoners on the 30th ult. The
Federal losses in both days is admitted by Mr. Stanton to have been
4000. The Confederate losses were also severe. There seems to have
been a pause in the fighting for some days. On the 7th inst. the
Confederates attacked General Butler's lines on the north of the James
River, and drove in the troops of General Kautz, whose guns they
captured. They then attacked the position occupied by General Birney's
corps, but were repulsed, and Birney retook the position, which had
been held by General Kautz, and forced back the Confederates "to their
inner line of defences." The Northern papers contain a report that the
larger portion of Grant's corps has recrossed from the north side of
the James River, but state that he retains his position in the
surrounding forts. Both sides were fortifying and preparing for a
great struggle.</p>
<p>Sheridan reports himself at Harrisonburg, preparing to resume the
attack on the Confederate forces, which hold fast to the Blue Ridge,
in front of Charlottesville. The New York papers point out that he has
a difficult task before him, but express the utmost confidence that he
will accomplish it.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia the Federals had made an attack on Saltville
and been badly repulsed.</p>
<p>We get a few details of the recent movements of Hood's army. This
force left its position at Jonesborough, between Atlanta and Macon, on
the 19th ult., under circumstances which led the Confederate
newspapers of Georgia to promise great success for their cause. It
moved at first to Montgomery and West Point Railroad. By the beginning
of October it became apparent that one of the objects of this movement
was to be better able to effect the destruction of the railroad in
Sherman's rear. Telegrams from Griffin, near Macon, to the Richmond
papers, dated Oct. 4, stated that all accounts agreed that Hood was
right in Sherman's rear, and held the road from Vining to
Marietta. Sherman, it was added, would be obliged to cut his way out
of Atlanta in a very few days. It soon appeared, however, that Hood
had no intention of placing his army where it could be so easily
attacked, and that only a division or two had been sent to Sherman's
rear. On the 4th of October a Confederate force captured Big Shanty,
upon which Sherman sent out General French with 7000 men to meet them,
and on the 6th an action took place. The fight lasted six hours, and
the Federals lost 300, while the Confederates left 1000 killed and
wounded in their hands. The Confederates retreated to Dallas. The
railroad in Sherman's rear was being rapidly repaired.</p>
<p>The Governor of Georgia had rejected General Sherman's proposal for
an informal peace conference.</p>
<p>The Confederates had entered Arkansas and were moving against
Little Rock. If they succeed in capturing it they intend to combine
with General Price, who is making a victorious march through Missouri,
and approaching Jefferson, the capital of the State, with the
intention of capturing it and establishing a State Government. The
Federal General Ewing's brigade, which had been compelled to evacuate
Pilot Knob, had succeeded in completing its retreat to Rolla, though
300 prisoners fell into the hands of General Price.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Macon Telegraph</hi> contains a speech
alleged to have been delivered by Jefferson Davis, asserting that
Sherman will be compelled to re-enact the retreat of Moscow, that the
independence of the South would be established, and the enemy defeated
if half the absent troops returned to their duty. The Southern press
is dissatisfied with the speech, and doubts its genuineness.</p>
<p>The Federal authorities in Tennessee had ordered a conscription of
all men, white or black, between eighteen and forty-five years of age,
and had announced that all persons in Tennessee who may vote at the
coming presidential election must swear to oppose an armistice and
peace negotiations with armed rebels until constitutional laws and
constitutional proclamations are re-established throughout the
State.</p>
<p>Secretary Fessenden had issued proposals for a new loan of
40,000,000 dollars, to bear six per cent interest, payable in gold. The
amount of the public debt announced on Sept. 30 is 1960 million
dollars. The latest quotation of gold at New York was 99
prem.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We </hi>have received, from our Special Artist
and Correspondent with the army of the Confederate States in Virginia,
two sketches illustrative of the recent operations in the Shenandoah
Valley, and one representing a conflict between Howlett's battery and
the Federal iron-clad gun-boats, or "monitors," in the James River,
some miles below the city of Richmond. In the first of these
Illustrations we have a picturesque view of the scenery of the Blue
Ridge Mountains at Front Royal, where the divisions commanded by
Kershaw and Fitz Lee descended into the Shenandoah Valley, and crossed
the river on their way to form a junction with the forces under
General Early, near Winchester. Our second Engraving shows the march
of the same body of troops through another part of the valley, which
here spreads to such width that it should rather be called a
plain. The Blue Ridge is seen in the distance, to our right hand; and
to our left is the smoke and flame of burning villages which have just
been visited by the Federal army. Our Special Artist, indeed, from his
actual observation, testifies that, on this occasion, "the Federals
retreated, burning and laying waste every homestead in their track;
thereby reducing hundreds of families to absolute poverty and possible
starvation"--treating the State of Virginia as a hostile country, but
in a spirit of wanton destructiveness unknown to modern European
warfare. The site of Howlett's Battery, which appears in the
foreground of our third Illustration, is on the south bank of the
James River. It forms the extreme left of the Confederate lines of
defence before Richmond, while the Federal works, discerned amid the
foliage of the background in our view, mark the extreme right of the
besiegers' position. The gun-boats or monitors are lying beneath the
opposite, or north, bank of the river. Midway between those vessels
and the battery are the obstructions placed in the channel by the
Federals to prevent the Confederate flotilla descending upon them. The
navigation of the river is so effectually closed that neither party
can get at the other by water, but they frequently exchange long
shots, as displayed in the present Illustration.</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from New York, by the Peruvian, to the evening of the
15th inst.</p>
<p>There had been no more fighting in the neighbourhood of
Richmond. General Grant had returned to Petersburg, after having
visited President Lincoln at Washington. General Lee's account of the
engagement on the north of the James River, on the 7th inst., stated
that the Confederates attacked the Federals on the Charles City road,
drove them from two intrenched lines, and captured ten guns, but that,
finding the enemy further strongly intrenched, they did not press the
Federals. On the other hand, General Grant's report stated that on the
7th inst. the Federals only lost 400 men, while the Confederate loss
amounted to 1100 men.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was said to have superseded General Early in the
command of the Confederates in the Shenandoah Valley. The Federals
under General Sheridan had retreated down the valley as far as
Strasburg. He was pursued by the Confederate cavalry under General
Rosser, but had, we are told, routed his pursuers near Strasburg,
taking eleven guns and 300 prisoners. During his retreat he had
desolated the whole country, and had burned all the houses for a
distance of five miles.</p>
<p>Several guerrilla bands have entered Maryland.</p>
<p>General Sherman, writing to Major-General Halleck, Chief of the
Staff, on the 9th inst., from Alatoona, reports as follows of the
state of things in Georgia:--</p>
<q><p>I reached Kenesaw Mountain, Oct. 6, just in time to witness, at
a distance the attack on Alatoona. I had anticipated this attack, and
had ordered from Rome General Corse with reinforcements. The attack
was met and repulsed, the enemy losing some 200 dead and more than
1000 wounded and prisoners. Our loss was about 700 in the
aggregate. The enemy captured the small garrisons at Big Shanty and
Ackworth, and burned about seven miles of our railroad; but we have at
Alatoona and Atlanta an abundance of provisions. Hood, observing our
approach, has moved rapidly back to Dallas and Van Wort, and I am
watching him in case he tries to reach Kingston or Rome. Atlanta is
perfectly secure to us, and this army is better off than in
camp.</p></q>
<p>The Richmond journals had published a despatch announcing that Rome
had been taken by the Confederates, who had made 3000 prisoners; and
other Southern journals assert that the movements progressing in
Georgia render Sherman's position untenable. A flotilla of Federal
transports which was ascending the Tennessee River had been attacked
by General Forrest's Confederates, who destroyed two transports and
compelled the others to retire with some loss.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Price had proclaimed his intention to
remain in Missouri, and had passed the Osage River and moved
westwards. His army, which was said to be 20,000 strong, was pursued
by 8000 Federal cavalry under General Pleasanton, who had engaged its
rear at Jefferson, while the Federal General Curtis, coming from
Kansas, engaged General Price in front. The result is not reported in
the Northern accounts; it may therefore be presumed to have been
favourable to Price, as he has expressed his intention to remain in
the State. Price's head-quarters were, at the time of the latest news,
at Borneville.</p>
<p>It is reported that the preparations which were being made for a
Federal attack on Wilmington, both by sea and land, were nearly
completed.</p>
<p>President Davis has returned to Richmond from his visit to
Georgia.</p>
<p>Vice-President Stephens has written a letter in which he says that
the only key-note to peace is the acknowledgment of the sovereignty of
the States. He favours an armistice and a convention of the States,
and believes that the question of the boundaries of the
confederacies--union or unions--would adjust themselves to the
interest of parties and the exigencies of the times.</p>
<p>The elections in Indiana and Ohio were said to have resulted in a
victory of the Republican party by a large majority, but in
Pennsylvania the Democratic party had gained largely, and the
soldiers' vote was awaited to decide the result of the election. In
the State of Maryland it was expected that the popular vote would
ensure the adoption of an anti-slavery constitution.</p>
<p>The "Democratic National Committee" had issued an address
protesting against the suppression of Democratic journals and the
imposition of test oaths at the elections in Tennessee. This address
was couched in threatening language, and vehemently condemned
President Lincoln's revolutionary purpose.</p>
<p>The death of Chief Justice Taney, of the United States Supreme
Court, is announced. It is reported that Mr. Case will succeed
him.</p>
<p>The bids for the loan of 40,000,000 dols. amount to 60,000,000
dols. The tenders range from par to thirty hundredths. The public debt
is now estimated at 4,000,000,000 dols. The price of gold has risen at
New York, the last quotation being 119 prem.</p>
<p>The case of the passengers of the steam-ship Ella has been decided
in favour of the Government.</p>
<p>The New York Commissioners of Emigration report that in the year
1864, up to Oct. 5, 151,393 immigrants had arrived; in the
corresponding period of 1863, the number was only 119,512.</p></div2>

<p>The Solicitor-General and Mr. Morrison, M.P., addressed their
constituents, at Plymouth, on Thursday week. The Solicitor-General
alluded to the efforts made by the Government to preserve neutrality
in respect to the American war, and especially to enforce the Foreign
Enlistment Act. For these efforts he claimed the approval of his
hearers. He spoke strongly in favour of non-intervention in foreign
affairs, and avowed that his opinions on reform, the ballot, and
church rates were unchanged. A vote of confidence in the learned
gentleman and his colleague was agreed to at the close of their
speeches.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...A contemporary tells us that a wrong report is abroad
concerning Mr. Sala's book on America, which is promised us at the end
of the year. This we seem some time ago to have indorsed, and it is
this--that the book would consist of a revised, expurgated, and
annotated edition of his excellent letters as a
correspondent. Fearless and bold as these letters are, detailing
immediate impressions with a photographic fidelity, we should have
been glad to have seen them reprinted; but we are told that the work
to be published in December will be entirely new, some of the matter
of the author's letters being only introduced in foot-notes.</p>
<p>"He makes a solitude, and calls it peace," is a good rendering of a
Latin quotation which has passed into a proverb. All conquerors have
tried to do so now and then, but probably none more wantonly and
effectually than General Sheridan--who we hope is not even a
collateral descendant of our brilliant Richard Brinsley--who has swept
the smiling Shenandoah Valley as bare as a flight of locusts leave a
corn-field. The whole country between the Blue Ridge and North
Mountains, he reports, is devastated; two thousand barns, seventy
mills, hay, flour, farming implements, and meal are all gone! In
retaliation for the shooting--how done we are not told--of a
non-commissioned engineer, he burnt all the dwellings within a radius
of five miles where he fell. "If you ask for my monument," cries the
epitaph of Wren, "look around you!" The spirit of engineer Meige may
repeat the sentence without variation; and this, we are told, is
war. Some years ago we used to hear from our cousins that the starving
millions of England could be fed by the valley of the Shenandoah
alone. Alas! now who will feed the feeders? Notwithstanding--nay,
rather because of--this, the tide of victory seems to be on the turn,
and indeed to have already commenced flowing in to the Confederate
side of that deep and dangerous channel which separates the two. Money
goes up in value, and the hearts of people are troubled--and no
wonder. The very best news we hear from the American continent is that
the <hi rend="italic">Con</hi>federation--the Canadians are particular
in their choice of words--of the Canadas goes quickly, silently, and
safely on; and that the whole of British America is loyal, peaceful,
and confident, and not at all dismayed at the promise of an invasion
so often held out to them from the brave boys of New England or the
drab-coated men of Pennsylvania. We all feel that when the
Confederation is accomplished there will be a good thing done, and
one, too, which, if many regret, all will own was
inevitable....</p></div2>

<p>The Jura brings intelligence from New York to the evening of the
22nd ult.</p>
<p>General Longstreet was defeated on the 19th ult. General Sheridan
states that before daylight the Confederates attacked his army at
Cedar Creek, turning and driving most of his line in confusion and
capturing twenty guns. He was then at Winchester, whence he hastened,
and found his troops driven back, between Middletown and Newtown. He
drew them up in line, and repulsed the enemy's attack at one o'clock
in the afternoon. Two hours afterwards he attacked the Confederates in
his turn, and drove and routed them, capturing fifty guns, including
those previously taken from the Federals. No official estimate had
been made of the slaughter on either side; but unofficial advices
state that the Federals had lost 5000 men, including four Generals,
and that they had taken 1600 prisoners. The defeated Confederates had
retreated to Woodstock, and were pursued as far as Fisher's Hill by
the Federal cavalry.</p>
<p>There has been little doing in the neighbourhood of Richmond. Two
divisions of Grant's army made a reconnaissance to Darby Town road,
where they found a new formidable line of Confederate works; they
assaulted them, but, having been repulsed, they withdrew, pursued by
the Confederates. The Federal loss was 400 men. General Lee reports
that the assault was easily repulsed, with a slight Confederate
loss.</p>
<p>Stanton reports that the telegraph is working to Atlanta. Southern
despatches indicate that Hood is about to change his base of
operations to North Alabama, where he will be joined by Beauregard, for
the prosecution of the campaign against <sic corr="Huntsville">Hautsville</sic>, Alabama. Walker's
Trans-Mississippi division has crossed the river to reinforce General
Hood. Southern journals continue to represent Sherman's position such
that the evacuation of Atlanta may daily be expected.</p>
<p>The Confederates, under General Forrest, were reported to have
invaded Western Kentucky.</p>
<p>General Price had taken Glasgow, and had obtained many recruits in
Missouri for his army, which was assuming formidable proportions; but
the Federals were concentrating their forces to attack him, and it was
reported that skirmishing had begun between his troops and those of
the Federal General Curtis.</p>
<p>Some twenty-five desperadoes, supposed to be Confederate refugees,
had attacked and plundered the bank at St. Albans, in the State of
Vermont, and had afterwards fled into Canada, where most of them had
been apprehended, and the money had been recovered.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi> was urging that
negroes should be armed by the South; and the Confederate Governor of
Louisiana was said to have made the same recommendation.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress will assemble at Richmond on the 7th
inst.</p>
<p>The presidential election in the United States will take place on
Tuesday next, the 8th inst.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has disclaimed any purpose of interfering with
the operation of the constitutional law, whatever may be the result of
the election.</p>
<p>A committee from Tennessee has presented a petition to President
Lincoln, asking to be relieved of the test oath required by Governor
Johnstone's proclamation. The committee have written a letter stating
that Lincoln replied that he supposed New York politicians had
concocted the petition; he expected that M'Clellan's friends would
manage their side of the election in their way; he would manage his in
his way. He might or might not hereafter write something about the
matter.</p>
<p>An anti-slavery Constitution has been adopted in Maryland by a
small majority, increasing the free States to twenty.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania the result of the voting was undecided; but the
soldiers' vote showed a large Republican majority.</p>
<p>In a long report addressed to the Secretary of War, Judge Holt had
asserted that an extensive conspiracy against the Union, under the
presidency of Mr. Vallandigham, had been formed, principally in the
north-western States, and that the conspirators, who numbered several
hundred thousand men, were mostly armed and organised.</p>
<p>The price of gold was constantly fluctuating in New York, but the
latest quotation on the evening of Oct. 22 was 212.</p>
<p>The Federal steamer Roanoke, which plied between Havannah and New
York, had been seized at sea by Confederates, who went on board as
passengers at Havannah. They landed her passengers and crew at
Bermuda, and then, after burning her off the harbour, returned in
boats to Bermuda, where they were arrested by the British
authorities.</p>
<p>The well-known Confederate cruiser the Florida has been captured
off Bahia by the Federal man-of-war Wachusetts. The <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>, the London Confederate organ, gives the
following account of her capture:--"The Confederate authorities in
London have received a telegraphic despatch, dated Lisbon, from
Captain Morris, commander of the Confederate steam-ship Florida,
announcing the capture of that vessel on Oct. 7 by the Federal steamer
Wachusetts in the harbour of Bahia. At the time of capture the Florida
was lying under the guns of the Brazilian forts and of the Brazilian
fleet, and Captain Morris was on shore. Captain Morris is on board the
Magdalena, bound for Southampton."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Water Of Saratoga Springs.</hi>--I took a
glass. What was it like? Well, let me see. Say half a pint of very
small beer, brewed during a thunder-storm at Brentford, and retained
for an unusual period in a chandler's shop in Seven-dials, where the
trade wasn't brisk, and the red herrings and the pitchy fire blazers
were kept on the top of the cask; then diluted with the water in which
cabbages had been boiled, and the drippings of the gingham umbrella,
bought secondhand in Vinegar-yard, on a very wet November day: then
sent to sea, and allowed to run freely down the lee scuppers; then
carefully collected in a hog tub, racked through a cask of turpentine
(that came over in a ship otherwise laden with guano and Monte Videan
hides, with the horns and hoofs on), mingled with the refuse of a
dyeworks, filtered through a gaspipe, to make it sweet and clean,

<p>A sharper took passage in an emigrant-ship from Bremen to
Baltimore, and, convincing the emigrants that gold was not current in
the United States, succeeded in buying with greenbacks nearly all the
gold in the possession of the passengers, at a discount of 30

<p rend="center">SLAVE-SOLDIERS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">There </hi>is no more revolutionary agency in
human affairs than war. It would be a mere truism to speak of the
rapid and violent changes which occur in the physical and material
condition of the countries in which war is waged. Despite of modern
theories of gentle and tender warfare, conducted on what are called
the principles and requirements of advanced civilisation, devastation,
rapine, and all their attendant miseries still characterise the
movements of belligerent armies. The moral and social effect of this
huge evil on nations and individuals may not be so patent, but it is
almost as certain. The influence for the worse which a single campaign
exercises on the minds, habits, and feelings of persons actually
bearing arms cannot be overrated in relation to a disregard of human
life and sufferings and a confusion of ideas on the subject of
property. But a deeper and wider influence is brought to bear on the
social and even the political opinions of communities by the operation
of war. No more notable instance of such an operation on the public
mind could be adduced than the change which has taken place, socially
and personally, so to speak, in the feeling of the American people
towards the negro race. It would be useless on the part of the most
pronounced adherent of the Federals to deny that in the social scale
the negro in the North has hitherto been forced into the condition of
a pariah. A system of special exclusiveness was adopted towards the
coloured race, which obtained in every public place, not excepting
places of worship. Contact with them was an abomination, and even in
the remotest degree the taint was sufficient to create and to nourish
aversion. But somehow, in the North, in the third or fourth year of
the civil war, all this has suffered a change. On the whole, the
negro--certainly the negro who escapes from the South--has been
promoted to the position of a pet. In a certain sense, the free black
is really more of a free man. His name has become another word for a
cause. Nay, there are some philosophical naturalists who hold that the
only hope of checking an alleged deterioration in the physique of the
American race is to be found in an engrafting of the negro upon the
white, and miscegenation is a familiar word in the Transatlantic
vocabulary. Indeed, so conscious is the gentleman of colour of his
rise in the social and physiological market, that a preacher of that
particular human family, reversing the once regular notice which was
prominent at the entrances of churches and chapels, has ventured to
announce that a special place will be set aside in his edifice for
such white people as might be desirous to attend his
ministrations.</p>
<p>But the most significant fact in reference to the status of the
negro in the Northern States is that of his enlistment and enrolment
in regiments in the Federal armies. No doubt, in the first instance,
this was intended as a stroke of subtle policy, a kind of protest
against that slavery which was made the ostensible, if not the chief,
motive of the war. Something of the needs of recruiting, and not a
little in regard to providing for the safe disposal of runaway slaves
from the South, may have been at the bottom of this proceeding; but
the privilege that was proclaimed was that of giving the
self-emancipated slave the opportunity of fighting against the system
of thraldom from which he had escaped. Contrary to expectation, the
negro regiments, who were secretly believed to be only food for
powder, turned out to be soldiers, equal, if not more than equal, to
the average; and now it is the regular custom to specify with
laudation their conduct in all the actions which take place. In the
case of negroes serving under white officers and brigaded with white
regiments, the attrition of war has rubbed down many angles of
opposition, and, in many instances, there has been something akin to
fraternisa-<pb n="478"/>tion between the troops of divergent
colours. So far as we at this distance can ascertain, the experiment
which bas been made in the Federal armies has been successful, and the
negro has made a further step in his progress towards the assertion of
his position amongst men--in America.</p>
<p>A proposal which has been mooted for the conscription of the negro
in the South bears upon the face of it a still greater importance than
is involved in the admission of that race to the armies of the
North. The condition of the black--slavery apart--in the South has
always been very different to that to which he was subjected in the
North. Although in the South his social status was technically more
distinctly defined, it is at least a question whether what may be
called his relations of contact and intercourse with the predominant
race were so marked by the antipathy in which his kindred in the North
was held. To be sure, he was a slave, and that comprehended everything
which could be held to be degradation; but personally, and with a
certain individuality, he was not treated as if he were positively
loathsome. He often lived in a sort of household familiarity with
whites to which the free negro of the North never attained. And yet
there were many reasons why the transformation of a Southern slave
into a Confederate soldier would have been a more violent change than
that which has taken place in the case of the free black of the
North. In the first place, the Southern negro represented so much
property, which was put in jeopardy by his enlistment; in the next
place, doubts might well exist of the prudence of arming and
disciplining a man to fight against a cause which, nominally and even
ostentatiously, was put forward as his own by the North; while the
services of that which was essentially the labouring population in a
country mostly agricultural was too necessary to its requirements,
either peaceful or belligerent, hastily to be given up. All these and
any other considerations which may have actuated the Confederates in
abstaining from recruiting their armies from the negro population
appear to be yielding to the inevitable necessities of the war; and we
hear that "the time has come to put into the army every able-bodied
negro as a soldier;" it is asserted that "he must now play an
important part in the war, that he caused the fight, and he must have
his portion of the burden." The most striking admission, however, in a
manifesto of the Governor of Louisiana from which the above sentences
are extracted, is to be found in a statement "that all able to bear
arms should be freed and put into the field at once." If this
principle is to be carried out in its integrity, the work of
emancipation will have begun at the moment the first negro corps is
enrolled. It is allowed, as a necessary condition to his becoming a
soldier, that the black man should cease to be a slave. Such a stipulation
was inevitable, and its result is equally inevitable. The exigencies
of the Crimean War forced on the Emperor of Russia the enlistment of
numbers of serfs, who, by the act of becoming soldiers of the empire,
were emancipated; and it is no strained presumption, but a logical
deduction, to assert that the ultimate enfranchisement of the whole of
the thralls of Muscovy was the consequence. Out of similar conditions
a like issue must be evoked in the Southern States of America.</p>
<p>If this suggestion of emancipation and enlistment be acted upon by
a solemn decree of the Confederate Congress, the Slave States will
have accepted the principle of the freedom of their negroes. From this
point of view, it becomes possible to bring the mind's-eye to dwell on
a prospect, more or less distant, of the cessation of the war. It may
be that the South would have comported itself with greater dignity if,
in the first instance, it had practically ceded the principle of negro
emancipation, as will now be the case if the new policy indicated be
adopted; but, at any rate, the point of difference which is assumed to
be at the root of the contest which is going on will disappear, and at
least one great pretext for internecine hostility will have been
removed. Doubtless, much may be said with regard to other inferences
to be drawn from the proposition to arm the slaves of the South. It
may be urged as a proof of a certain exhaustion in the Confederate
States, coincident, however, with a stubborn determination to continue
the contest by all available means and in all extremities. The
rendition of their slaves to the military service of their country
would be, unquestionably, a great sacrifice on the altar of patriotism
by the proprietors of the South, and it might also do much towards
prolonging hostilities. But if by the act of creating a black soldier,
a slave is converted into a FREED-MAN, it is undeniable that slavery as
an institution is breached, and its ultimate fall is only a
question of time. It is not for us in this country to lay down the
terms on which the fratricidal war in the States of America should be
brought to a conclusion; but we are not to be denied the privilege of
being glad to perceive any sign or symptom which points, however
remotely, to its cessation. But if, by some happy combination of
events, the termination of the war and the extinction of slavery as a
principle, in due time to vivify into a fact, should synchronise,
nowhere in the world would there be more sincere rejoicing at such a
circumstance than amongst the peaceful and free people of
England.</p></div2>

<p>The news brought by the Damascus and the City of Washington is of
interest. The latter vessel called at Cape Race, and brings New York
telegrams to the evening of the 1st inst.</p>
<p>The Federals under General Sheridan, in the Shenandoah Valley,
remained at Cedar Creek; and the Confederates, who held Newmarket and
Fisher's Hill, were said to be in strong force. The Secretary of War
had issued an order thanking General Sheridan, his officers, and
soldiers for their brilliant victories.</p>
<p>General Grant's army made, on the 27th ult., a reconnaissance in
force of the Confederate lines, both on the north and on the south of
the James River; and the result was that the Federals resumed their
old position. There were, we are told, casualties on both sides, and
the Federals took 900 prisoners. The latest despatches state that in
this reconnaissance the corps commanded by General Grant in person had
1500 men killed and wounded, while the losses sustained by General
Butler's corps, on the north of the James River, were still
heavier.</p>
<p>General Beauregard had formally assumed the command of the
Confederate army of the south-west. He has issued an address granting
an amnesty to absent soldiers returning within thirty days. He says he
joins the army, full of hope and confidence in the struggle, to strike
a blow which shall bring success to the Southern army and a triumph to
the cause of peace and to the country. The Confederates under General
Hood were reported to have attacked Decatur, but to have been
repulsed, and to have then crossed to the north of the Tennessee
River; and later despatches represented General Hood to have been on
the 30th ult. at Cypress Creek, north of the Tennessee.</p>
<p>General Price's army was stated to have been routed, dispersed, and
driven below Fort Scott by the Federals, who took two generals and
several guns, and recaptured many of the prisoners made in Missouri by
the Confederates, whose defeated forces were said to be retreating
into Arkansas.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Forrest was said to be threatening Columbus
and Paducah in Kentucky; and it had been reported in Louisville that
Paducah had actually fallen into the hands of the Confederates.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times </hi>correspondent says:--"A great
naval and military expedition to attack Wilmington, fitted out at
Fortress Monroe, and consisting of forty ships, including several
ironclads and 40,000 troops, has been placed under the command of
Admiral Porter."</p>
<p>At a convention of Governors of the Confederate States, held at
Augusta, it was resolved to prosecute the war to the last extremity,
and that the Confederate Government should be authorised to make
levies of negroes for military service. It was asserted that during
the winter the Confederates would arm and drill 300,000 negroes.</p>
<p>President Davis has made an important speech at Columbia, South
Carolina. It is full of defiance, and calls energetically on the
citizens of the South to rally to the support of their cause. He
utterly repudiates peace negotiations, unless based on the principle
of Southern independence.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress was to assemble at Richmond on the 7th
inst.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has issued a proclamation setting apart the last
Thursday in November for a day of thanksgiving and praise to Almighty
God for victories over the enemy.</p>
<p>The Republican and Democratic parties were imputing to each other
monstrous frauds and forgeries in regard of the soldiers' votes. The
Governor of Kentucky had issued a proclamation ordering the Sheriffs
to arrest any military officers who might attempt to interfere in the
approaching elections in that State; and the Governor of New York had
likewise deemed it necessary to forbid military interference at the
polling-booths.</p>
<p>The proposed new Constitution for Maryland, which was rejected by
the civil votes, has been carried by those of the soldiers, giving an
absolute majority of 193 in its favour. The people have, however,
appealed against the legality of the soldiers' votes. The Supreme
Court at Baltimore had refused an application to compel the Governor
of Maryland to throw out the soldiers' vote.</p>
<p>The price of gold had been rising in New York, and on the morning
of the 1st inst., the date of the latest telegrams, it was quoted at
137 7/8 per cent premium.</p></div2>

<p>A statement was published some time ago to the effect that Captain
Semmes and about 100 of his men had sailed from Liverpool in a vessel
called the Laurel, which also took out with her a heavy cargo of
munitions of war. This statement was contradicted in the most positive
manner; but a despatch has been received in Liverpool announcing that
the Laurel had arrived at Funchal, that Captain Semmes was on board,
and that that officer and his men, together with the stores taken out
by the Laurel, had been transferred to a large screw-steamer, which
is, of course, alleged to be a new Alabama.</p></div2>

<p>...What has become of that large peace memorial which went over
the water to Mr. Seward praying America to become united? Has it been
thrown overboard; or has Columbia received Britannia's little letter
and put it away with a memorandum, "Not to be answered"? Alas for
human consistency! Mr. John Bright has illustrated his principles of
peace like Cromwell, who took for his motto "<hi rend="italic">Pax
qu&#x153;ritur bello</hi>," by patting Brother Jonathan on his back
and telling him to keep pegging away. Well, a man may do that if he
likes; but Mr. Bright has no "call" to insinuate that effete
aristocracies and lovers of tyrannical Governments wish the South to
win in order that the great Republic may be disrupted. The longer the
great Republic has to fight the larger her debt will become; and,
unless some extraordinary fate is reserved for America, debt must
produce its usual burdens. It is worthy of note that as the war rolls
on it gets deeper and more intense in its fury. This is very natural,
however it may be deplored. The upheaval of the negro in the social
scale seems to be, as we have always said, inevitable. He is to be
enrolled as a soldier in the South, and by his courage will purchase
his freedom. So that Nathaniel Lee's mad line may now be changed in
one word, and it will bear the truth of a prophecy:--</p>

<p>...After some hesitation on the part of the Hon. M. Edmonds, who
represents the United States Government, the further proceedings in
connection with the trial of the St. Albans raiders have been
transferred from St. John to Montreal. The Judges at Montreal had
refused to grant a writ of habeas corpus for the raiders, on the
ground that they were still under the magistrates' jurisdiction, and
that no commitment had been made. A judicial investigation into the
affair, under the Ashburton Treaty, was in progress at Montreal....</p>

<p>We had hoped that the New York or the City of Glasgow would have
brought us news of the result of the presidential election. Both these
steamers have, however, arrived without bringing the eagerly-desired
intelligence. They were off Cape Race on the 9th inst., a day after
the election, but the weather, unhappily, was too thick to
communicate. Possibly we shall be able to give the information in our
town edition.</p>
<p>There is little war news of moment. Grant's army has returned to
its former position. It has been ascertained that the country around
the Southside Railroad is strongly fortified. During the movement the
Confederates on the Boylton plank-road charged the right flank of the
2nd Corps at a point where the connection between the 2nd and 5th
Corps was not formed. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times'</hi>
correspondent asserts that this forced Grant to withdraw his troops to
a safer position. During Butler's movement General Weitzel assaulted
the Confederate position on the Williamsburg road, but was repulsed
with heavy loss. Grant lost 1500 men, and captured 800 prisoners. On
Sunday, the 30th ult., the Confederates penetrated into Grant's lines
for some distance between the 2nd and 5th Corps, taking numerous
prisoners. They afterwards charged the breastworks, but were
repulsed. According to the latest accounts, Grant's troops were
engaged in building loghouses, an apparent indication that they
expected to winter in their present positions.</p>
<p>There have been no fresh movements in the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>The accounts respecting the movements of General Hood's and General
Sherman's armies are obscure and uncertain. Hood, as stated in our
last Number, had attacked Decatur, and been repulsed with the loss of
four guns and a hundred prisoners.</p>
<p>The Confederate iron-clad ram Albemarle, which had caused much
uneasiness to the Federals in the inner waters of North Carolina, has
been destroyed. One launch was sunk by the Confederate fire, and
nearly its entire crew lost. It appears that the destruction of the
ram was accomplished by a boat with a "torpedo attachment." A naval
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> states that
the Federals have six boats, about the size of a ship's launch, fitted
up with torpedo apparatus. The mode of operation he does not
describe.</p>
<p>The United States gun-boat Undine was captured by the Confederates
at Fort Herman on the Tennessee River.</p>
<p>The Tallahassee and the Chickamauga, the two Confederate cruisers
which escaped from Wilmington, had destroyed six vessels off the
Northern coast; and a third Confederate privateer was also said to be
at sea, and to have made a capture.</p>

<p>At a mass meeting of merchants and bankers, held in Wall-street, in
favour of M'Clellan, President Lincoln's abolition policy was

interests of the country required a change of administration.</p>
<p>The war democracy have held a meeting in New York. General Dix read
an address refusing to support the Chicago nominee or platform and
recommending the reorganisation of the democracy.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward had announced to the Mayors of Buffalo and New
York that he had received information of the existence of a
conspiracy in Canada to send incendiaries into the principal Northern
cities on the day of the presidential election. The Mayor of New York
had replied that he disbelieved the information, but was prepared to
maintain the public safety; and the Democratic journals accused the
Government of inventing the whole story in order to have a pretext for
proclaiming martial law.</p>
<p>A Democratic torchlight procession was attacked on the night of the
30th ult. in Philadelphia, and a serious fight ensued, in which a
number of persons were severely injured and two killed.</p>
<p>The new Constitution has been officially proclaimed in Maryland by
Governor Bradford, the Court of Appeal having refused to issue an
order striking out the soldiers' votes. The majority claimed is
475. Maryland is therefore declared a free State from the 1st of
November. Salutes in honour of the event have been fired in

<p rend="center">THE LATE OUTRAGE ON THE NEUTRALITY OF BRAZIL.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>readers will not have forgotten the
extraordinary action perpetrated by the Commander of a United States
war-steamer, the Wachusetts, in the neutral harbour of Bahia, on the
7th ult., when an attack was suddenly made upon the steamer Florida,
belonging to the navy of the Confederate States, and, after a few
minutes' struggle with the few men who were on board, the Florida was
audaciously carried away from beneath the protection of the Brazilian
forts and ships of war. We are indebted to the Rev. C. G. Nicolay,
English chaplain at Bahia, for the means of publishing an Illustration
of this strange affair. One of our Engravings represents the position
of the two American ships, with the Brazilian corvette lying between
them, at the usual anchorage for men-of-war, previously to the hostile
movement of the Wachusetts. This position is between Fort Gamboa and
Fort do Mar, and is unquestionably within the accustomed harbour...</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">If </hi>any one following on the track of
Dr. Thompson, in his exploration of the "sensational" in literature,
were to ask for the tap root of this gigantic growth, he might find it
in that natural curiosity which attaches to the perpetration and
perpetrators of all great crimes. Have not two big books, "Les Crimes
C&#xE9;l&#xE8;bres" and "Les Causes C&#xE9;l&#xE8;bres," upon
this absorbing topic, reached England from France, two amongst
hundreds? Do not the "Newgate Calendar" and the twenty-seven volumes
of "State Trials" find their purchasers; and have we not had
"Curiosities," and "Romances," and certain Chronicles of crime whence,
as from a reserve, the captains of fiction have drawn great armies
into the field; and, lastly, have we not all during the last week been
watching the last act of a murder-tragedy with wonderful interest?
Again, were we not all intensely relieved, nay, as much "overjoyed,"
as the newspapers had it, as good Dr. Cappel himself, when he ran down
the ladder into the prison, crying out, "Thank God he has confessed"?
Yes, the chief actor in this dire tragedy, who, by wickedness, force
of character, obstinacy, stupidity, cupidity, or what you will, had
raised himself to the bad eminence he occupied, had moreover attained
a certain mastery over the weaker minds by which he was surrounded,
and had impressed them with an idea of his innocence. So in this
"sensational novel," which we all read in the newspapers, the interest
was wrought up to one point, and the culmination--the secret being
well kept--only took place at the very last second of time, when,
before that fatal trap opened which let the murderer fall from Time to
Eternity, he muttered the words, "Ya, Ich habe es gethan"--"Yes, I did
it," and thus took a load from all our breasts. The law of the country
was well, vigorously, and yet gently administered, and in the whole
trial there is nothing of which England need feel ashamed. Nor,
certainly, need anyone feel ashamed at the intense interest which a
great crime awakens. "But for the grace of God, there goes
Wm. Huntingdon," said that preacher, pointing to a criminal.</p>
<p>In reference to this railway murder, the story of which has
travelled over all America, Mr. Sala, in his letters from the "Midst
of War," reminds us that we are not, after all, the worst off as to
travelling, though our carriages are isolated boxes, and there be
little or no communication between them. In America they go to the
opposite extreme, and, as everybody knows, one can walk down the
centre of a carriage containing a hundred or so of passengers. But
selfish and dishonest humanity takes advantage even of this open-class
travelling, and a gang of 200 ruffians, on the Erie Railroad, lately
robbed and insulted every man, woman, and child in a train, and then
quietly effected their escape. We may learn from this that convenience
and safety in travelling are not to be attained by any one plan, but
that they lie, as everybody of experience always supposed them to do,
in the middle of two systems. Saloon carriages are useful, carriages
reserved for the unprotected female are indispensable also, and a
communication or thorough outlook for the guard we must have; and this
might be done with a reflecting mirror placed in front of his seat, so
that, whichever way he turned, any signal from a carriage would catch
his eye....</p>
<p>As gold goes up in New York, and disasters looked at at first by
the diminishing end of the telescope assume their real proportions, so
the hopes of the Confederates rise and their partisans come
forward. Mr. Spence, the "S." of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, whose
letters on American affairs are always read with interest, has again
favoured the public with his views on the "fratricidal war," and, like
most Englishmen, is hopeful of the effect of the slave soldier of the
South. Everybody's vaticination of a servile war seems to be
wrong. Pompey or C&#xE6;sar, the bone of contention, may in the long
run remain master of the situation; certainly we believe that the
negro race will be the only one which will benefit by the contest. If
great situations produce great men, and man is the creature of the
creative circumstance, now is C&#xE6;sar's time. If he do not come
forward, he must be content to remain <hi rend="italic">nullus</hi>
for the next generation. A black Hannibal, on the part of in North,
contending with a Scipio Africanus from Alabama, or somewhere else
south of Mason and Dixie's line, would go far to settle the question
of the equality of the races....</p></div2>

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Down in Tennessee</hi>. By Edmund Kirke. (1
vol. Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.) The writer, in May, 1863, set out
from it is not easy to discover whence, but probably New York, to
visit the South-west. More than a year later he went to Richmond, where
he had an interview with Mr. Jefferson Davis. The book makes one smile
and sigh alternately. It is full of anecdotes, amusing, and
distressing of the American civil war, and it gives but little hope of
an early end of the wearisome strife. The writer concludes:--"There
can be no peace so long as Mr. Davis controls the South. Ignoring
slavery, he himself<pb n="519"/> states the issue--the only issue with
him--union or disunion. That is it. We must conquer or be
conquered. We can negotiate only with the bayonet. We can have peace
only by putting forth all our strength, crushing the Southern armies,
and overthrowing the Southern Government." It was in July, 1864, that
the writer and Colonel Jaques had audience of Mr. Davis, and peace
seems still as distant as it was then....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN PRESIDENCY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In </hi>itself, the election of a President of
the Federal States of America could have aroused very little, if any,
of that anxiety which agitates those who watch a competitive
struggle. The issue was so certain that, even amongst the people for
whom the event possessed a real and actual interest, the sweet pangs
of suspense must have been wanting. Practically, Mr. Lincoln had no
antagonist. An invitation to a four years' occupation of the White
House at Washington now by no means implied a pleasant tenure of an
office, which, in a self-governed country, used to be accompanied with
few of the cares and not too many of the responsibilities of
state. The candidature for the presidency was, therefore, peculiarly
circumscribed on this occasion, and scarcely any individual emerged
from comparative obscurity to present what has often proved the best
claim to support--namely, an ignorance on the part of the nation over
which he was to rule (to say nothing of the world in general) of
anything about him. When the contest came to be confined to
Mr. Lincoln and General M'Clellan, the principles on which it was to
be conducted were supposed to be defined. The one was the acknowledged
representative of the Republican and the war party; the other was
announced to stand as typifying the Democrats, and something more,
for, while he was proclaimed as the embodiment of a policy which
desired the preservation of the Union, it also comprehended the
restoration of peace between the contending States. However those who
laid down this policy proposed to carry it out, at least General
M'Clellan at a very early period of his candidature, which, by-the-by,
seemed on a great measure to have been involuntary on his part,
disclaimed all notion of being responsible for the opinions which had
been inscribed for him on what the Americans call his ticket; declined
to pledge himself at least to a peace-at-any-price policy, and so
effectually neutralised any opposition to Mr. Lincoln, which was
thereafter carried on but feebly in his name, and the race became as
nearly as possible a walk over. On the face of it, then, it would
appear that the principles which Mr. Lincoln professes and which in an
especial manner he may be supposed to represent, have obtained a great
triumph, and the policy of the Federal States may be assumed to be
settled for the next four years. It may also be asserted that the
re-election of the existing President is a more decided testimony in
favour of the cause of which he is the emblem than the first choice of
a man who was at that time, so to speak, a political abstraction. The
force of these assumptions may nevertheless be subjected to some
modifications.</p>
<p>Although American history is so shortlived that events scarcely
survive in memory for four years, it is possible that it may be
recollected, even in such a go-ahead country, that the election of the
President, four years ago, was the result of a severe struggle for
political ascendancy between two parties in the State, both of which
put forth their strength to secure a victory. The entire people of the
United States were engaged in this contest; every State in the Union
took part in it; and, as they contended for a principle, and one which
enlisted all the sympathies and all the energies of opponent parties,
it mattered very little, at the moment, who or what the man was who
represented the opinions of the section which was seeking to oust
another from power. Perhaps the very fact of his obscurity was
considered to be an element in the triumph of the Republican party if
it succeeded; for their immediate purposes a Chinese joss would have
sufficed. They did triumph, and ere long King Log was created by
circumstances into one of the most powerful and responsible rulers in
the world. Without entering into the question of his capabilities for
his great function, we must accept the fact that Mr. Lincoln has in a
manner become a necessity to the Federal party, and his reelection has
become almost a matter of course. In a sense, which is not the usual
flattering sense, he is without a rival. Not only is he practically
freed from the impediment of personal opponents, but the suffrage by
which he is re-elected has been changed from that to which he appealed
in his first<pb n="526"/> candidature. The whole of the Southern
States have nothing to say in this election, and with them, of course,
has vanished the great bulk of the personnel of the party which fought
so hard against Mr. Lincoln in his representative character in
1860. Numerically, the Democrats have lost at least two thirds of
their strength in the presidential election for the Northern
States. The records of previous elections show how vast was the
influence of the party in power in the choice of President. For years,
what was theoretically a popular election had resolved itself into a
system of succession. How much more complete must be that organised
action of the ascendant power in the State in such a matter now, when
the Government is a practical despotism, and when--to take one
special, though new, instance of its peculiar command of those
resources which have always been unscrupulously used in political
movements--the election could be turned by the votes of the soldiers
in the large army, of which the aspirant to re-election is not only
technically but in a very efficacious sense the Commander-in-Chief!
Indeed, it seems almost a waste of argument and a supererogation to
bring together the circumstances which would prove that the
re-election of Mr. Lincoln was a certainty. Divination with regard to
the effect of his continuance in power is by no means so easy.</p>
<p>There are those who do not hesitate to lay down the results of this
event in no measured language. With them it signifies the deliberate
abdication by the American people of their right of self-government;
an avowed step towards the foundation of a military despotism, towards
the subversion of a popular Government, which may still exist in form,
but which in substance is gone; and that the second presidency of
Mr. Lincoln may be taken as the period from which to date the complete
abrogation of the American Constitution and the commencement of that
transition state, so well known to students of history, through which
republics pass on their way from democracy to tyranny. Again, it is
pronounced that this re-election means, in the North, new
conscriptions, abridged liberty, the free press fettered, and free
speech suppressed; and, throughout the South, a renewed outburst of
all the horrors of war, followed by social anarchy. It is probable
that sober-thinking men, even amongst those who least affect
Mr. Lincoln and his policy, will be inclined to treat such high talk
as manifest exaggeration.</p>
<p>It may, perhaps, be permitted to some impartial observers of the
great contest which is going on in America to derive some gleams of
hope in reference to the settlement of the question in issue, even out
of this apparently unhopeful circumstance of the renewal of a
Government which is pledged to a prosecution of the war. At least one
point has been gained--the supremacy of a distinct and intelligible
policy has been asserted. The Northern States understand that they
will be asked to continue to carry on the war on the same scale and
with the same undeviating continuity for four years more. Surely, this
is a proposition which may well bring every man to reflection and to a
careful consideration at once of the causes and the effects of the
struggle in which the antagonistic States are engaged. Not being
prepared to give in our adhesion to that doctrine of the abnegation of
popular Government by the American people to which we have alluded
above, we are prone to hold to a belief that, ere long, public opinion
in the North will assert itself in reprobation of a policy involving
consequences so tremendous, sacrifices so awful; and all for what is
fast becoming a dream of national unity, a unity founded, not upon
sympathies of race, habits, and institutions, but on mere geographical
considerations. There is already a peace party, which is neither
contemptible for number nor influence; and with such a prospect as is
deliberately offered to the Federal States by the twice-chosen symbol
of civil war, it is incredible but that the feelings and principles of
that party will make way into the minds of a people, in the main
sober, sensible, and not so over-burdened with abstract enthusiasm as
to be prepared to immolate all that it holds dear for an idea.</p>
<p>During the period of this civil war it is computed that the Federal
States have contracted a debt amounting to three thousand millions of
dollars; that within three years three hundred thousand men, in the
vigour of health and in the pride of early manhood, have died, and two
hundred thousand more have been maimed and crippled, in the service of
the North. Every family in those States has its wounded son; many have
several; and hundreds of thousands mourn those who have fallen never
to rise again. This is the retrospect; is it to be the prospect? No
doubt the American people have shown great resolution, great aptitude
to look their trials and troubles in the face; but the question is
whether they have not done enough to prove those qualities, and
whether the time has not arrived when they may yield to gentler
influences, and think of submitting their political differences to
other arbitrament than that of the sword. Again, we take on ourselves
to repudiate the notion that the people of the North have now
delivered themselves up as mere puppets into the coarse hands of
Mr. Lincoln for another term of presidential power. It may be that at
present he symbolises a sort of vague opinion of the majority of them;
but to say that, if that opinion should change and their wishes take a
different direction, he will be able to control and mould such a
people to purposes of mere personal ambition, is to presuppose in this
creature of unhappy circumstances the commanding qualities and
character of a Cromwell--a resemblance which even caricaturists have
not yet imagined. It is possible that, after all, the prolongation of
Mr. Lincoln's tenure of office once will be productive of ultimate
benefit to the people over whom he has been selected to rule for eight
years; and that, by means which he never intended and the concurrence
of events which he never contemplated, he may become the involuntary
saviour of his country.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL
INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has been re-elected President by a large
majority. According to the <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi>
correspondent, who telegraphed on the 10th inst., "Mr. Lincoln has at
the lowest estimate a numerical majority of 400,000 votes;" and
another correspondent telegraphs that "Lincoln has 213 out of the 234
electoral votes." Mr. Andrew Johnson, Military Governor of Tennessee,
has been elected Vice-President. There were no serious disturbances
during the elections in any of the States.</p>
<p>On the night of the 8th inst. President Lincoln was serenaded by a
company of Pennsylvanians, and on the night of the 10th he was
serenaded by the Columbian Republican Clubs. Mr. Lincoln declared that
the peaceable consummation of the recent elections in the midst of a
great civil war proved the ability of a Republican Government to
maintain its existence in a great emergency, and at the same time
preserve the liberties of its people. Now that the elections were
over, he appealed to all parties to unite in a common effort to save
the common country; and, while expressing his gratitude to Almighty
God for directing the mind of the country to what he considered a
right conclusion, he added that it afforded no satisfaction to think
any other man might have been disappointed by the result.</p>
<p>It is reported that M'Clellan has tendered a resignation of his
major-general's commission, and that the President refused to accept
it, and will probably offer him a command.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has made a speech at Auburn, in which he pledged the
Government to a vigorous prosecution of the war and declared that
there was no intention on their part to abandon the war measures
against slavery.</p>
<p>Whilst the North continues to breathe threatenings and slaughter,
the South abates not one jot of heart or hope. The Message of the
Southern President at the reopening of the Confederate Congress, on
the 8th inst., has been published. President Davis spoke in a defiant
tone. He favourably reviewed the military, financial, and material
situation. He complained of the non-recognition of the Southern
Confederacy by the great Powers of Europe, but declared that the South
desired no intervention, and was able to maintain its own rights, and
that peace was impossible without independence. He recommended that
the slaves in the service of the Government should be raised to the number of
40,000, should be employed as engineers, labourers, and pioneers,
receiving a preliminary training which would render them a valuable
reserve in case of emergency, and should be promised their freedom at
the end of the war. He disapproved any general levy and arming of the
slaves; but should the alternative be presented of subjugation or the
employment of slaves as soldiers, no doubt exists what would then be
his decision.</p>
<p>A bill has been introduced into the Confederate Congress enlisting
all white men between eighteen and forty-five, and revoking all
exemptions.</p>
<p>The war news is unimportant, and some of it more than usually
obscure; that from Georgia, especially, is "confusion worse
confounded." First there was a rumour that the Federals under Sherman
have burnt and evacuated Atlanta, and started off through Georgia
towards Charleston. "This statement," adds the telegram, "requires
confirmation." The statement is reiterated, however, by a despatch of
the 11th inst., through Mr. Reuter's agency, but discredited by the
<hi rend="italic">Times'</hi> correspondent in a telegram of the same
date. The latest item is dated the 12th, as follows:--"No particulars
are yet known of Sherman's movements, but they are reported to be
progressing favourably. The<pb n="527"/> burning of Atlanta has not
yet been confirmed." So of General Hood. There were contradictory
reports that he had succeeded in crossing the Tennessee with his
troops, and that he had been foiled in the attempt. According to one
account, he has destroyed the Federal gun-boats and transports at
Johnsonville, capturing the officers and crews, and taking a large
quantity of stores and artillery.</p>
<p>General Price was said to have been again defeated by the Federals
at Newtonia, and to be retreating with his recruits and supplies
towards Arkansas; and the Confederate invasion of Missouri was
apparently regarded as terminated, for the Federal Generals Rosecranz
[i.e., Rosecrans]
and Pleasanton had returned to St. Louis.</p>
<p>There had been no serious operations in the neighbourhood of
Richmond, though there had been some skirmishing, caused by a
Confederate reconnaissance of General Grant's left. General Lee's
forces are said to be now as numerous as Grant's, and an offensive
movement on the part of Lee was expected.</p>
<p>In the Shenandoah Valley General Ewell has superseded Early in the
command of the Confederates; and Sheridan, with his Federal troops,
has retired to Windsor. There are rumours of an advance by Early, also
of a co-operation movement by Longstreet and Breckenridge in
South-Western Virginia for an invasion of the Northern States. At last
dates Sheridan was near Winchester, and the Confederates at Newmarket,
receiving reinforcements.</p>
<p>In consequence of the destruction of the Confederate ram Albemarle,
the Federal gun-boats had been enabled to reoccupy the town of
Plymouth, in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The news of the seizure of the Florida at Bahia had been received,
and had provoked much discussion; but the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi>, a journal in the confidence of the Administration,
declared that "America owed Brazil satisfaction and an apology, in
accordance with the usage of nations, for the seizure of the
Florida."</p>
<p>The privateer Chickamauga continues her depredations.</p>
<p>Numerous citizens in Chicago have been arrested, charged with a
plot to burn the city and release the Confederate prisoners. The
Democrats have issued a protest declaring that the arrests were made
an excuse for military interference at the polls.</p>
<p>General Butler had taken the chief command of the troops in the
State of New York; and it was asserted that he had warned goldbrokers
that they must not speculate in gold to the detriment of the
Government. Mr. Fenton has been elected Governor of New York.</p>
<p>The price of gold had varied from 260 to 243 3/8, standing at the
latter quotation.</p>
<p>New York advices state that Mr. Charles Windsor, for fourteen years
one of the principal cashiers of the Mercantile Bank in that city, has
absconded, leaving a deficiency in his accounts of nearly
&#xA3;50,000. The Mercantile Bank, after deducting this loss, has
still a reserve of about &#xA3;90,000.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>...A Quebec telegram says:--"Prominent men from the Northern
States are here urging the Canadian Government to energetic
co-operation with the American authorities to preserve the peace of
the frontier. Efficient measures on the part of the Canadian
Government have been taken."</p>
<p>The examination of the witnesses in the St. Alban's raid was
proceeding slowly in Montreal.</p></div2>

<p>The Californian papers give an excellent report of Mr. and
Mrs. C. Kean's reception in San Francisco, to which place they went
direct from Melbourne. They made their d&#xE9;but at Maguire's Opera
House, on Oct. 8, in "Henry VIII." and "The Jealous Wife." On the 10th
they appeared in "Louis XI." Their appearance has been accepted by the
critics as the revival of taste in relation to the drama. We quote
from one of the papers some remarks, the moral of which, at this time,
we regret to add, is only too applicable to ourselves. The writer
complains that the taste of the theatre-goers of San Francisco was
becoming vitiated and corrupted, although they had among them
excellent dramatic talent, but no artiste with sufficient national
reputation to ensure full houses or to arrest the downward tendency of
stage morals. "The boards," he continues, "had become debauched by
adventurers in the profession, who, lacking the talents to secure
pre-eminence, inaugurated a vulgar style of pieces, termed
'spectacular,' in which exposed limbs and indecent rant usurped the
creations of mind; and illustrious authors were thrust aside for the
accommodation of literary empirics." Theatrical managers gratified a
"depraved public taste by ministering to its desires; and, withdrawing
those who were really ornaments of the profession, substituted
pretenders who had no scruples on the score of propriety, but adapted
their feeble powers to the personation of such characters as Mazeppa
and Jack Sheppard with a brazen-faced assurance that caused the
'judicious to grieve.' " We repeat, that this moral is capable of
application nearer home; and we shall be glad if these remarks of our
colonial critic should lead theatrical conductors and their supporters
to reflect on the mischief they are perpetrating by such improper
exhibitions.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">DESTRUCTION OF THE<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Packet Roanoke.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>magistrates in session at the
Townhall of St. George's, Bermuda, on the 10th ult., investigated a
singular charge of piracy against Lieutenant John C. Braine, Acting
Master in the Navy of the Confederate States, and a party of men in
the same service, who were prosecuted by the Attorney-General of
Bermuda for unlawfully seizing and destroying the United States
mail-steamer Roanoke upon the high seas. The charge fell to the
ground, of course, on the production of Lieutenant Braine's commission
and his letter of instructions from Mr. S. R. Mallory, the Secretary
of the Navy of the Confederate Government. The prisoners were
therefore immediately discharged; but as the capture of this vessel,
whether an act of legitimate warfare or not, was effected by most
unusual means, it is worthy of a brief narrative and Illustration. It
seems that the Roanoke was accustomed to ply regularly between Cuba
and New York; and at four o'clock on the afternoon of Sept. 29 she
left the port of Havannah, passing the Moro Castle, at five p.m., with
twenty-four cabin passengers and sixteen in the steerage, the officers
and crew numbering fifty, making in all ninety persons on board. The
steamer proceeded on her voyage at a speed of twelve knots per hour,
running within sight of the coast for two or three hours, the time
passing agreeably and without anything unusual having occurred until
9.20 p.m., when about twenty-five miles off the coast of Cuba. The
captain and crew were then surprised by a party of ten men among the
passengers, under the command of Lieutenant Braine, who went through
the ship dressed in a naval uniform, exclaiming, "In the name of the
Confederate States of America, I demand the surrender of this vessel
as a lawful prize," and calling upon Captain Drew, the commander of
the Roanoke, to surrender as a prisoner of war. The announcement was
immediately followed by the discharge of several pistols, with which
the attacking party were armed. From that moment the work of capture
commenced. Lieutenant Braine, taking the upper deck of the vessel,
accompanied by his second officer, the purser, and a seaman, secured
the the captain and officers on the deck, placing them in irons, while
the first officer, first and second engineers, and the seamen
proceeded with the capture of the officers and crew on the main deck,
until Lieut. Braine and his second officer, leaving the upper deck in
charge of the purser and a seaman, went below to the assistance of the
first officer. In the space of fifty-five minutes the capture had been
consummated, and the vessel was proceeding on her voyage as the
Confederate<pb n="542"/> States prize steam-ship Roanoke. There was
but little violent resistance made except by the carpenter of the
vessel, who, after having surrendered, seized an axe and aimed a blow
at the head of the first officer; but, the axe falling short of its
mark, four balls pierced the body of the man, from the effects of
which he fell and died in a few minutes. In a short time after the
capture Captain Drew was released upon his parole. The crew were kept
on duty, as before. Some of the officers of the Roanoke were put in
irons for a few hours during the night, but the passengers were
treated with the utmost civility and friendship. When the vessel
arrived off Bermuda, it was Lieutenant Braine's purpose to bring her
into the port of St. George's, lay in a stock of provisions and coals,
then parole and land the passengers, officers, and crew, and take the
vessel to Wilmington; but, it having been found impossible to take the
vessel into the British port, the only thing he could do was to burn
the Roanoke, and, with his officers and crew, go ashore at
St. George's. This he accordingly did (after transferring the
passengers, officers, and crew to a brig five miles off the coast) at
four o'clock on the morning of Sunday, the 9th of October inst. Our
Engraving is made from a sketch taken by one of the passengers, who
has sent it to us, with a letter, through Mr. G. T. Fullam, late
engineer of the Alabama. The Roanoke, it seems, was built in New York
by the New York and Virginia Navigation Company, who were her sole
owners; her dimensions being in length 218 ft.; breadth, 32ft.; depth,
10 ft. 6 in.; and measuring 1071 tons.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IN AMERICA.<lb/>(<hi rend="italic">From a Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, Nov. 3.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> struggle for the presidency increases
in interest as well as in bitterness. The passions of both parties
have been excited, and accusations of fraud and falsification of
balloting papers, committed, attempted, and planned, have been as
thick as <q rend="center">Iron sleet of arrowy shower.</q> On the side of the
Republican, or Lincoln, party, nothing is heard but a daily din of
"Treason! treason!" while on that of the Democratic, or M'Clellan,
party, as vehement a cry is continually raised of "Tyranny!" and
"Usurpation!" The partizans of Mr. Lincoln have the advantage of
possession, and unwisely threaten to employ the military force at
their disposal to keep the peace on the day of election, to prevent
the reception of illegal and fictitious votes, and to arrest all
"traitors" and other "disloyal" or "suspected" persons who shall
present themselves at the polls. The opposing party, scandalised at
the accusation either of "treason" or "disloyalty" directed against
them by a faction that misuses the accident of its being the faction
of the "ins" and not of the "outs," declares, in the plainest English,
its determination to resist by force of arms any attempt on the part
of the Federal Government or its military officials to coerce the
people, or interfere with the freest exercise of the constitutional
right. They assert that the presence of soldiers at the polls, except
as citizens, to cast in their votes like the rest, is an outrage upon
public liberty which cannot be tolerated, unless the Americans are
prepared to accept a military despotism and to allow Mr. Lincoln to
perpetuate his power by the bayonet. It must be remembered, however,
that the Americans of both parties in the North are more in the habit
of "speaking daggers" at each other than of using them; and that,
perhaps, all this loud talking is but the bark of a dog that will not
bite--mere "buncombe," intended for present effect.</p>
<p>The great bones of contention are--in the first place, the vote of
the army; in the second, the vote of the Border States held by
military occupancy, and in which so-called "disloyal" people, who will
not take a test oath, are to be excluded from the polls. The second
difficulty is by far the greater of the two, and threatens, if
Mr. Lincoln manage it in the mode proposed by his faithful lieutenant,
Mr. Andrew Johnson, in Tennessee, the gravest complications both now
and hereafter.</p>
<p>As regards the soldiers, there appears every reason to believe that
they are as three to one in favour of General M'Clellan. Although the
original army of the Potomac, as it existed under his leadership
during the great but indecisive series of battles which ended at
Antietam no longer exists; though it has been decimated and
re-decimated by fire and sword; though malaria and the camp-fever have
stricken down thousands and tens of thousands; though many of the
survivors of its earliest combats limp about the streets of Northern
cities, the maimed and mutilated veterans of a war in which they can
no longer take a part; and though the term of service of vast numbers
of the men has expired, and scarcely a tenth of M'Clellan's original
soldiers remain in the field, yet the whole army retains the
traditions of his command, and the great majority, if not tampered
with by their officers in favour of Mr. Lincoln, will cast their votes
for their former General. The same feeling, as far as is known,
prevails in the other armies of the Republic. The men desire to place
a soldier in the presidential chair--more, perhaps, for professional
than for political reasons, and possibly because they share with the
country at large the impression that Mr. Lincoln has been, is, and
must continue to be, a failure, from inherent defect of character and
want of ability, and that any change made must be a change for the
better.</p>
<p>But, as this result is past hoping for, the vote of the soldiers,
however it may happen to fall, is not of vital importance to either
candidate. The men are not to vote en masse, as soldiers, but
separately, as citizens--the vote being counted to the State in which
the soldier had his habitation before entering the service. The
decision of the issue, not falling directly to the people, rests
ultimately with the States as represented by the electors chosen on
the 8th inst. Hence it is that so much importance attaches to the
action of the Government in Louisiana, where the Federal authority
extends no further than the range of its guns; and in Maryland,
Kentucky, Arkansas, and Tennessee, where the population is divided in
allegiance between the South and the North, and where, if the Federal
armies were withdrawn, the Northern party would subside into very
small dimensions or wholly disappear. As in these States no one will
be allowed to vote who will not take an oath of "loyalty" and approval
of the acts of Mr. Lincoln's Government, it follows that the
Democratic party and the friends and supporters of General M'Clellan will
be disfranchised by military pressure, and that in the electoral
college these States will be counted for Mr. Lincoln. This is the
great and paramount peril before the country. It would be much better
and safer if Mr. Lincoln's advisers would, for the purposes of the
election, consider Louisiana as much excluded from the electoral
contest as Georgia or the Carolinas, and meddle no further with the
polls in the Border States than to preserve the peace between hostile
factions. In this case Mr. Lincoln might be defeated, but he would
retire from the presidency with honour, and render it impossible for
the future historian to say of him, that he preferred the risk of new
and endless civil commotions to the peaceful relinquishment of a power
which he was incompetent to wield and which the people had made up
their minds to confer upon another.</p>
<p>At a meeting, held on Tuesday night last, of a section of the
Democratic party--which has broken loose from its old associates and
connections and determines to support the vigorous prosecution of the
war, and, consequently, Mr. Lincoln as more likely than General
M'Clellan to carry out the views of its members--it was proposed, as a
future solution of a difficulty which threatens to be chronic, that a
convention of the whole people of the States should be called for the
amendment of the Constitution. The first amendment proposes the
abolition of the Electoral Colleges, with the intention of delegating
directly to the people the election of the President and
Vice-President; and the second prohibits the re-election of a
President or Vice-President for a second term. Were this the law and
the Constitution at the present moment, there can be no doubt that a
very imminent danger would be averted. But, however admirably the plan
might work in the future, it is totally inapplicable in the
present. Even General Dix, its proposer, will not carry out his own
principle to the extent of voting against Mr. Lincoln. On the
contrary, he will not only support him, but will go, and has gone, out
of his way, as Military Commander in the district of New York, to
support him by extraneous and unconstitutional means. On the pretext
that Southern refugees from Canada will cross over into the United
States on Tuesday next to offer their votes at the polls, he has
declared by military proclamation that he will take possession of all
the polling-places on the Canadian frontier in order to preserve the
peace. Such an interference as this is wholly gratuitous, and is a
gross invasion of the rights and prerogative of Governor Seymour in
New York and of the other local Governors in Vermont and Maine, who
alone are charged with the duty of maintaining order and tranquillity
in the States under their jurisdiction, and have militiamen at their
command more than sufficient to meet any such danger as General Dix
anticipates, even if it were as real as it is imaginary. The
proclamation is one of many that has caused ill feeling, and done far
more to diminish the chances of Mr. Lincoln than any act of
Mr. Lincoln's opponents. In fact, Mr. Lincoln suffers far more from
his friends than from his foes, and has not the courage--perhaps not
the wish--to extricate himself from the net of judicious counsel which
they have woven and coiled around him.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the aggregate result of the vote in the Electoral
Colleges--and it seems all but certain that Mr. Lincoln will be
elected by a large majority--it is as clear as a mathematical
calculation that the great State of New York will elect a college in
favour of M'Clellan and most probable that all the most wealthy and
populous States of the Union, except the New England States, will do
likewise. Mr. Lincoln's strength lies in New England (except in
Connecticut), in the Western, North-Western, and Pacific States; in
the new State of Nevada, admitted into the Union on the 1st instant;
and in the Southern and Border States of which, or of a portion of
which, the Federal troops hold temporary possession.</p>
<p>P.S. General Din's proclamation was doing so much harm to
Mr. Lincoln that it has been withdrawn; it is asserted by express
orders from Washington.</p></div2>

<p>...Across the wide Atlantic "Uncle Abe," or "Father
Abraham"--for the President stands in a double relationship to his
obedient sons--has been again elected as absolute monarch for a term
of four years; and it must be confessed that, so far as we know, the
election has been well and quietly conducted, and went off without
noise, tumult, or bloodshed. But then, so did our 10th of April, 1848,
and possibly for the same reason. Mr. Lincoln and the English Ministry
were fully prepared.</p>
<p>England does not know exactly whether to congratulate herself or
not on the result of the American election. So thoroughly had people
made up their mind that he would be re-elected that even the
"sperrits" at a s&#xE9;ance of a vulgar Medium foretold it, in
conjunction, also, with the due execution of M&#xFC;ller; so that
the ghosts were right on the double event. As the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> puts it, perhaps we are better off than with
General M'Clellan, because Lincoln has passed through the rabies
against England which is always demanded of a fresh President. What we
hope for now is that the matured counsels of President Lincoln and his
advisers may turn towards peace. Unfortunately, Mr. Seward, who is one
of the wire-pullers of the great Lincoln, does not care to look at
matters in this light. He has told his admirers that in the game they
are playing "three out of five throws go for the winner," and
therefore, presuming, we suppose, that the throws in the game have
been as yet equal, the North will prepare immediately on the
re-election of the President to enter the lists, like the Duke's "bony
'priser" and young Orlando in "As You Like It," and have another
tussle. We all remember that, in that beautiful pastoral comedy, the
biggest man did not get the better, and that the "'priser" was carried
away, spoilt for life and good for nothing. Mr. Seward kindly
suggests, however, that this fate is reserved for the South, and,
parodying a well-known passage of Scripture, represents the
Southerners as prodigals, crying out on their knees, "Father Abraham
we have sinned before God and against our brethren, and"--We will not
continue the quotation. The parallel is, to say the very least of it,
in offensively bad taste.</p>
<p>Let us add that, even in the midst of massacres and sickening
slaughter, there are one or two cheerful signs, which peep up like
winter violets from the dead leaves. A very observant but, alas! a
casual correspondent writes that he can see the civilising effects of
war in the bearing of the men, that America is beginning to lose that
careless, ruffling brusquerie which distinguished her, and that there
is altogether more order, earnestness, and gentle bearing than were to
be met with before the war....</p>
<p>A biography of the Brothers Davenport is to be published by
Dr. Nicholls, whose last volumes on America were certainly some of the
very best we have ever had. Let us hope he will take a philosophic
view of the curious state of the human mind which permits such evident
chicanery as is generally indulged in by mediums to pass off as the
actual work of spirits--i.e., preternatural or miraculous. An
intelligent writer, Mr. Barkas, of Newcastle, who has had twelve
years' experience of spiritualism, has published two discourses on the
matter, in the last of which he sums up his creed in twenty-four
articles, so that intelligent spiritualism requires fifteen less than
the Anglican Church. Some of these articles are well worth
weighing. Mr. Barkas believes, and we cordially agree with him, "that
the common practise of spiritualism is injurious to mind and body, and
entirely unnecessary to Christian men and women who possess a
reasonable faith; that those who practise it render themselves liable
to pernicious obsession; that there is a considerable analogy between
some forms of modern spiritualism and ancient witchcraft, sorcery, and
necromancy; and that the less we become devotees of modern
spiritualism the better we shall succeed in the Divine life." All this
is very sound and good. If spiritualism be not witchcraft, it has the
same effect, and they who practise it become confused and silly. Our
author cites Timothy iv, 1--"In the latter times some shall depart
from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of
devils," an a text expressly referring to this curious
illusion....</p></div2>

<p>One pleasing and hopeful feature in our Canadian colony is the
rapid and steady strides with which education is advancing
therein. Taking a period of eleven years--from 1850 to 1861, for
example--this educational progress appears remarkable, if not
unparalleled. Within this comparatively brief time the grammar schools
have increased by thirty-one and the pupils by 2500, while the common
schools exhibit an increase of 910 buildings and 163,921 pupils. In
1850 the number of free schools was but 252; in 1860 they numbered
2350. The augmentation of attendance at schools is very noticeable,
and favourably compares with some of the most flourishing Federal
States. During the eleven years specified that increase is in the
following ratio:--Pennsylvania, 38 per cent; State of New York, 9 per
cent; Massachusetts, 35 per cent; and Upper Canada, 108 per cent. Even
in the matter of school moneys Canada takes precedence of those
States--the increase for ten years being, in Pennsylvania, 175 per
cent; State of New York, 145 per cent; Massachusetts, 68 per cent; and
Canada West, 222 per cent.--<hi rend="italic">English America, by

<p>We have news from New York to the evening of the 19th ult. There
was still no certain intelligence respecting General Sherman's
movements, but it was positively affirmed that the Federals had
evacuated Atlanta, after destroying all the fortifications, public
buildings, and railways; and the Richmond journals said that the
evacuation took place on the 12th ult. It was reported in the North
that General Sherman, with 50,000 men, was moving towards Macon and
Augusta; but, according to the Richmond newspapers, one column of his
army was marching on Selma, in Alabama. It was said that the
Confederate General Hood had concentrated his forces at Florence, in
Alabama, but the rumour was as uncertain as the accounts of General
Sherman's movements; and it was also asserted that a large body of
Confederates, under General Beauregard, was advancing from Corinth
towards Memphis.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Breckenridge had defeated the Federal
General Gillem at Bull's Gap, in East Tennessee, and had taken six
guns and 400 prisoners.</p>
<p>A rumour that the Confederates had captured Morganzia, in
Louisiana, with 1900 prisoners, had been transmitted from Mobile to
Richmond.</p>
<p>It was asserted that General Early was retiring up the Shenandoah
Valley, and that the Federals, under General Sheridan, were following
him. The Confederates made a dash at Grant's left, but were
repulsed.</p>
<p>There had not been any fresh fighting in the neighbourhood of
Richmond or Petersburg. General Butler had resumed the command of the
Federal troops on the north bank of the James River.</p>
<p>On the question of the arming of the slaves being discussed in the
Confederate Congress, the plan was opposed by a large number of
members.</p>
<p>It was rumoured that President Lincoln was about to send
commissioners to Richmond, for the purpose of proffering to the South
peace upon, it was supposed, the conditions that a general amnesty be
granted, and that the Southern States return to the Union with all
their rights and privileges, and that slavery be abolished.</p>
<p>The French Minister and Mr. Seward have had interviews on the
question of peace. The former expressed the strong wish of the Emperor
for peace.</p>
<p>The New York papers state that President Lincoln wishes that those
desirous to call upon him personally will postpone their visits for a
time, as he is engaged in preparing his annual Message to
Congress.</p>
<p>A grand reception was given to General Butler at the Fifth Avenue
Hotel, New York, on the 14th ult. General Butler suggested that an
amnesty should now be offered to the Confederates, and that if they
did not accept it there should be a short, sharp, and decisive war, to
be followed by a partition of Southern lands among the soldiers. On
the following day General Butler quitted New York to rejoin the army
before Richmond, issuing, before doing so, a general order
congratulating all concerned upon the peaceful termination of his
mission.</p>
<p>General Sheridan had been nominated as senior Major-General in the
United States army, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of
General M'Clellan.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-Governor Jacobs, of Kentucky, has been arrested and
taken to Washington as a state prisoner. The charge against him has
not transpired.</p>
<p>There had been violent fluctuations in the price of gold at New
York, in consequence of the Treasury payment of 9,000,000 dols. in gold
in advance of the interest on the gold-bearing debt, and also of
rumours that General Sherman had obtained considerable successes; but
the latest quotation on the 19th ult. was 121 per cent premium.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons is about to return from Washington on six months' leave,
necessitated by ill-health. The statement that his Lordship has
resigned his post is, however, erroneous. Mr. J. Hume Burnley,
Secretary of Legation, has been appointed Charg&#xE9; d'Affaires, in
the usual course, during Lord Lyons's absence.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ELECTION DAY IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our </hi>New York Correspondent has supplied a
pair of Sketches, representing the crowds outside two of the
polling-places in that city, on Tuesday, the 8th of November, which
was the day of the Presidential election, as well as of the State
elections. One of them is situated in the upper part of the city, near
the fashionable avenues which run out northward, through the
aristocratic quarter. "Here the poll is taken," says our
correspondent, "in the office of a veterinary surgeon, attached to a
livery stable. At any time from sunrise to sunset (which is the time
allowed for depositing votes) knots of the richer class of New York
citizens--the Upper Ten Thousand, as they are called, are to be seen
congregated at this point, anxiously discussing the chances of the
rival candidates. Mixed with these, however, a sprinkling of the
rougher element is here and there conspicuous. There are, indeed, two
or three young men in the crowd who might, on any other day, be seen
parading Broadway in rather swell costume, but who have, on this
occasion, come out as 'shoulder-hitters,' or pugilistic partisan
bullies, attired after the fashion usually affected by those members of
the 'Lower Twenty' who 'travel on their muscle.' They have red shirts on,
without any collar or cravat; pilot coats, and heavy cowskin boots
pulled over their trousers--a style of costume which shows them to be
members of some Fire Company. By way of contrast, the subject of our
second Illustration is found in the dirty and unwholesome districts of
the city, where the hard-fisted classes chiefly make their abode. In
this quarter, on the polling-day, the police were in strong force, and
the liquor-shops were all closed--that is, the shutters of those dens
of iniquity were up; but as the doors were open there was no
difficulty in obtaining strong drink. All circumstances considered,
however, there were wonderfully few drunken men to be seen, and such
fighting as did take place was of a desultory and insignificant
kind. The locality of the polling-place is one of the very worst in
New York, being in the heart of the quarter known as the Five
Points--the head-quarters of the thieves, bullies, organ-grinders, and

<p rend="center">LAGER BEER IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"To </hi>appreciate the great German element
in the social and political life of America requires," says our New
York correspondent, "a treatise on lager beer. The Teutonic population
of New York, including the neigbbouring Brooklyn, Hoboken, and Jersey
City, amounts to about 150,000; every one of whom, from the grizzled
patriarch and old woman to the babe of tender years, may safely be
counted upon as one of the consumers of their national beverage. Nor
is the pussion for lager beer confined to these. It has become an
'institution' of the land, and, during the summer months at least, its
consumption by the other citizens of New York would alone keep a
respectable number of breweries in full operation.</p>
<p>"Lager beer proper is composed of malt, hops, and water, and its
excellence is said to depend much upon the quality of the spring from
which the water is obtained. It is lighter than the beer of England,
and has a bitter-aromatic flavour, very grateful to the
palate. During the hot season, however, it is apt to have a taste of
resin, a slight infusion of which is considered necessary to keep it
sound. A stronger kind of this beverage, called bock beer, is much
indulged in by some of the steady old topers who frequent the beer
gardens and saloons. This is of a more potent brewage than the
ordinary sort, and its specific gravity is one third greater, as it
has so much more of the malt ingredient in its composition. Bock beer
is of a darker colour than the common lager, and possesses a certain
luscious flavour, being spiced with an infusion of coriander or some
such aromatic seed. It takes its name from the frolicsome spirit
supposed to be imparted by it to its imbibers, whose gambols remind
the observant Teuton of those of the bock, or goat, a figure of which
animal, engaged in sportive dalliance with a beer cask, is usually to
be seen as a sign in places where this brewage is on tap. Lager beer
is invariably drunk out of small glass mugs, in shape somewhat
resembling the pewter tankard of the English alehouse. The New York
price for a mug of it used to be four cents; but the war prices extend
to every article now, and the rates at which it is sold in the city and
suburbs vary from six cents to ten. One of the meanings of the German
word 'lager' is a storehouse. Hence this kind of malt beverage derives
its name, the variety of it brewed for summer drinking, especially,
being stored away for some months before it is considered fit for
use. Another kind, much used in summer by the Germans in America, and
more particularly by the Prussians, is that known as 'weiss bier,' or
white beer. This is a light, frothy beverage, brewed from one part of
barley malt and five parts of wheat. Like all wheat beers, it speedily
turns sour, on which account it must be consumed while it is yet fresh
and new. It has a sickly, swilly, flavour, and, because of the immense
head of froth it carries, is drunk out of tall glasses resembling lamp
chimneys. Its price is usually the same as that of the common lager
beer.</p>
<p>"There is hardly a street, lane, or alley in the city of New York
in which the lager beer saloon, in some of its various forms, is not
to be

<pb n="561"/> found. The Garten Wirthschaft, a tavern with a
small pretence of rural verdure attached to its premises, is most
endeared to the contemplative Teuton, who loves to take his leisure
under the greenwood tree. Some of these beer gardens, especially in
the eastern part of the city, are on an immense scale. There are two
or three in the Bowery that can each accommodate at least a thousand
sitters. A portion of these buildings opens to a small plot of ground,
roofed over with glass or canvas, and sparsely studded with sickly
shrubs. Generally, there is a little fountain in full play, with
goldfish and small turtles swimming about in its basin. Music is
always a leading attraction here. From the afternoon until a late hour
of night the band performs industriously in a gallery high over head;
and each musician removes the ophicleide or flute from his lips only
to refresh them with a mug of lager beer. In the intervals of the
music the players light their pipes or cigars, and sit gravely
studying the scores before them. In some of these places there is a
small stage at one end, with a piano and a stout woman in fancy
costume who sings gutturally to the twanging of a monstrous
guitar. The company are chiefly well-to-do mechanics and tradespeople,
who bring their wives, and children with them, and even the baby is
sure to be treated with a modicum of the ruddy malt. The waiters
deftly wind in and out through the crowd, with three or four mugs in
each hand and a couple of glasses on the top. Small girls parade up
and down with little trays of sweetmeat for sale. Games of various
kinds are carried on in the side alleys. There is Invariably a
shooting-gallery, where, at a distance of some twelve paces, the bold
marksman from the Black Forest pops little shuttlecock bolts from a
spring gun at a grotesque figure made of painted wood, which, on being
wounded in the 'bull's-eye,' whisks round on a pivot and jerks into
its place a lovely woman, also of painted wood. The walls in some of
these places are adorned with cartoons of wondrous device. Sigel, the
chosen war-chief of the American Germans, figures often in a terrible
battle-piece, rushing, on his fiery steed, over a field thickly sown
with the bodies of dying and dead Confederates.</p>
<p>"As in Bavaria, so in New York, most of the great breweries have
<hi rend="italic">bier gartens </hi>or saloons annexed to them, in
which the refreshing beverage is dispensed cool and fresh from the
vaults. Conspicuous on the right bank of the Hudson River, about five
miles above New York, stands a tall, white, tower-like structure, with
a red roof. This is the great Guttenburg brewery, built against those
grand rocks called the 'Palisades.' in which its immense cellars and
storehouses are excavated. In the top story of this building, which is
flush with the upper road and reached by a 'Jacob's ladder' of steep
steps from the lower, there is a spacious hall containing billiard-tables, a piano, and a bar for the lager beer and the pleasant
vintages of the Rhine."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEST IN AMERICA.<lb/>(<hi rend="italic">From a Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, Nov. 10.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>presidential
election--notwithstanding all the efforts made by Mr. Seward and
others to frighten the people about attempted raids from Canada, and
silly plots to burn down New York and other cities--has passed over
with the utmost quiet and decorum. The weather on Tuesday was anything
but pleasant; but the people were in the best of tempers, and were not
even provoked into impatience by the presence of General Butler and a
large military force, but went to the work of voting as peaceably as
though it were a common election for a parochial or a municipal
office. The result in New York was largely in favour of General
M'Clellan, as most people anticipated; but everywhere else--from Maine
to Maryland, and from New Jersey to Minnesota--the contest was
exceedingly close, and the votes polled much larger than usual. The
returns for the more distant States have not yet been received, nor
have the estimates been accurately made even in this city; but enough
is known of the aggregate results to prove that Mr. Lincoln has been
elected by a considerable majority of the people--some say 200,000 and
others 400,000--and by an electoral vote in the colleges of more than
two to one. It is impossible for any critic or observer, native or
foreign, who considers how violently the passions of the people have
been inflamed; what antagonisms of principle, as well as conflicts of
material interest, have been excited by the war; and what tremendous
issues were involved in the result of the election, to avoid the
expression of cordial admiration for the manly self-control which the
people exhibited on this memorable occasion. The spectacle is declared
by the Americans themselves to have been one of the highest moral
grandeur, if not of sublimity; and, though our cousins on this side of
the water are somewhat too much in the habit of using fine words and
indulging in hyperbole, no one who witnessed the long lines of busy
men, neglecting their business for awhile to attend to the more
important business of the State, and waiting patiently in the street
amid the fog and rain until it came to their turn to deposit their
balloting-paper in the appointed box--using no jostling in pressing,
indulging in no altercation with each other on the exciting subject
which drew them together, and in every way behaving with as much
subdued dignity as if they were attending a place of worship--can deny
that the encomium is abundantly merited. Rich and poor--the
millionaire and the Irish coachman who drove him to the poll--the
owner of ships, and railway shares, and lands, and houses, and the
keeper of the chandler's shop or corner grocery--the employer of
labour and the labourer himself--all stood quietly together, the great
man neither attempting to persuade nor to coerce the little one, but
each leaving the other to his own right of private judgment and the
duty of acting as he thought best for the interests of the country. No
breach of the peace occurred during the day, either in New York or any
other part of the country; and nothing like popular excitement of any
kind occurred until the close of the polls, at sunset. Shortly after
that time, the anxiety to learn the result drew the people out in
great numbers to the newspaper and telegraphic offices, the great
hotels, and other places of public resort, where vast crowds remained
until two or three o'clock in the morning, greeting each announcement
of a victory for their favourite candidate in the city wards or in
remoter towns with vociferous cheers; and of a victory for their
opponents with hisses and groans. But even here the utmost good humour
prevailed. By order of the police authorities, all the "grogshops,"
"rum-holes," taverns, and groceries where liquor is sold had been
closed during the day. This order is always promulgated on the day of
a presidential election, but is never very generally obeyed. On
Tuesday, however, it was rigidly enforced, and the
spirit-dealers--perhaps with a wholesome terror of the redoubtable
General Butler before their eyes, lent themselves to the arrangement
with unwonted alacrity, and closed even the back doors, by which their
favourite customers and friends might have been furtively admitted. On
the morrow the city resumed its usual appearance. The full tide of
life and business flowed as freely and rapidly as before. The result
of the voting, however, did not appear to be favourably received in
Wall-street; for the premium on gold advanced from ten to twelve
percent as soon as it became authoritatively known that Mr. Lincoln's
re-election was beyond a doubt. The Democratic party as yet has borne
its defeat with exemplary equanimity; and the abuse of Mr. Lincoln,
and the hard words and unsavoury epithets in which his opponents were
wont to indulge towards him while he stood in the position of a
candidate ceased, as if by common consent, as soon as his election
became an admitted fact. It would almost appear as if the party were
demoralised by their defeat. Up to the last moment, and perhaps led
away by the enthusiasm which existed for General M'Clellan in the city
of New York, they did not think it possible that their candidate could
be defeated; and hence did not duly reflect upon their proper line of
policy, if that event should occur. It will take time to recover from
the rout. Federal victories in the field, should these occur, will
keep them for a while in the background; but at the first serious
reverse to Northern arms and the first real pressure of the inevitable
conscription, accompanied, as these would assuredly be, by
perturbations in the sensitive money market, they will take heart of
grace, rally their broken and scattered legions, and come before the
public with something like a principle on which to stand. Mr. Lincoln,
on his part, bears his new honours meekly as well as gracefully, and
in a speech just delivered at the White House to a large crowd who
came with music and banners to congratulate him on his re-election,
spoke with the greatest good feeling and good taste of the necessity
of oblivion for all the animosities engendered by the strife, and of
his earnest desire to conciliate men of all parties. General
M'Clellan, it appears, resigned his commission in the Federal army on
the morning of the election, and before the result could possibly be
anticipated on better ground than the hope of either party. Should
Mr. Lincoln refuse to accept the resignation and appoint his
unsuccessful rival to such high command in the army as his genius, his
character, and (in spite of his defeat) his undoubted popularity,
warrant the President in giving and the General in accepting, he will
effect a masterstroke of policy. It remains to be seen whether he will
be magnanimous enough to do so.</p></div2>

<p>...While Mr. Lincoln is getting up a proclamation, hinted at by
General Butler after the episode of the double revolvers, which will
offer to the Southerners an unconditional amnesty, leaders included,
if they will at once return to their Northern brethren, the Canadians
are debating under what name their country shall henceforward be
known. Some propose Canadia, differing only in one letter; but others,
to mark their origin and the pride they have in it, suggest New Britain,
Britannia, and West Britain. The unanimity of feeling amongst all
classes is very delightful. Even the Yankee reporter of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, a gentleman who, we presume, has
now and then been employed in ridiculing "Canadian blue-noses" and
throwing mud at "old Mother England," could not fail to be struck with
the attachment shown to the mother country. It appears to have at once
astonished and perplexed him. It cannot, however, fail to gratify
us. Britain does not want, in spite of Professor Somebody and
Chancellor Blank, to be severed from her colonies. The war in America
has done her and them this service--it has taught them that the
constitution they possess is really the freest in the world, and that
the bonds which bind them in allegiance to the mother country, though
as strong as steel, are, as they wear them, as light as silken
fetters....</p></div2>

<p>By the Peruvian and the City of London we have New York dispatches
to the afternoon of the 26th ult.</p>
<p>General Sherman is making his way through the heart of Georgia,
laying waste the whole country in the track of his columns. There is,
however, little as yet positively known as to his movements, and these
is no certainty as to the point at which he is aiming. It seems as if
he were making for Augusta, one portion of his cavalry having reached
Gordon. He appears to have extended his army along a wide extent of
country, and had burned several towns through which he passed. There
was a report that he had captured Macon, but this is not confirmed. On
the contrary, at the last account, the Confederate General Wheeler
with his cavalry was said to be disputing the advance of Sherman's
column on that place. General Beauregard had telegraphed that he would
soon be in Georgia to aid in repelling the invader, and he requested
the people to destroy everything before Sherman, so that he could not
live on the country. The Georgian representatives had also telegraphed
a similar request. Meantime, the militia were mustering in all
directions, and orders had been given that the local forces of North
and South Carolina should go beyond the borders of their own States to
assist in repelling the bold Federal. Hood was progressing rapidly in
Tennessee. He was advancing on Pulaski, from which the Federals were
retreating, making for Colombo, where an engagement was
expected. Thus we have the remarkable spectacle of a Federal General
making his way by fire and sword through the rich cotton State of
Georgia, and of the Confederate General so lately opposed to him
carrying at the same time the war northward.</p>
<p>At Petersburg no active movement had taken place; but the
Confederates were reported to be mining under Grant's lines. On a late
Federal reconnaissance in the Shenandoah Valley Early was found in
strong force at Rood's Hill.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has issued a proclamation announcing that the
blockade of the ports of Norfolk, Virginia, and Pensacola and
Fernandina, Florida, should be raised on Dec. 1, when those ports
would be opened to commerce, excluding only articles contraband of
war.</p>
<p>The exchange of prisoners of war is still in progress at
Savannah. At last accounts nearly 4000 had been exchanged.</p>
<p>The Hon. Reuben E. Fenton, Governor Elect of the State of New York,
in responding to a serenade at the Astor House, stated that hereafter
the State should occupy no hesitating or equivocal position. The issue
presented to the people, he said, was whether they would maintain the
Government in its integrity, or whether the advantages gained over the
Confederates should be surrendered, thus acknowledging the inability
of the North to maintain the contest and becoming the laughing-stock
and derision of mankind.</p>
<p>It is reported from Washington that Lord Lyons has almost recovered
from his recent illness.</p>
<p>An attempt was, we are told, made, on the night of the 25th ult.,
to set fire simultaneously to a number of the great hotels, theatres,
and public buildings of New York; but it is added that little damage
was done. Two of the alleged incendiaries had been apprehended, and it
was supposed that Confederate emissaries were connected with the
plot.</p>
<p>The latest quotation of gold at New York was 122&#xBD; per cent
premium.</p>
<p>The Canadian authorities, finding that the Southerners were
collecting munitions of war at various points, had prohibited the
exportation of arms.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PEYTON FALLS, IN VIRGINIA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We </hi>have engraved on another page a
sketch, by an amateur artist, of Peyton Falls, in the <sic corr="Allegheny">Alleghany</sic>
Mountains, Western Virginia. This romantic and beautiful cascade is on
the Falling Spring, a brook tributary to Jackson's River. It is
situated in the district or township which was once known as West
Augusta, a place remarkable for the courage and patriotism of its
inhabitants. This is the place to which Washington referred when he
said, in the darkest days of the American Revolution, "Give me but a
banner, and I will plant it upon the mountains of West Augusta, and
rally around me the men who will raise our bleeding country from the
dust and set her free!" Stonewall Jackson, the hero of the present
unhappy civil war, as well as many officers of his immortal brigade,
was a native of this district. It was near Peyton Falls, indeed, that
one of the first battles of the civil war occurred--that of Rich
Mountain, in which fell General R. S. Garnett <pb n="576"/>and Colonel
John A. Washington. Peyton Falls is the highest cascade or waterfall
in America, being 200 ft. in height, while that of Niagara is only 150
ft. The principal stream, however, is only about 10 yards wide at the
top and a little more spread at the bottom of the fall. The water is
bright and sparkling, and the stream in other parts is full of
trout. Near the cascade there is a mineral spring of rare curative
properties.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Again</hi>, England, in peace and prosperity,
is preparing for the great Christian festival, and again she has to
look sadly across the sea, where those who own her blood and speak her
language are engaged in the fourth year of a frightful war. It would
seem, indeed, that every mail is destined to bring tidings that the
ordinary horrors of strife are increased by some new barbarism. We
have heard of whole districts laid waste; we have heard of prisoners
being placed under fire; we have heard of other prisoners murdered in
cold blood, by one side as a deed of vengeance, by the other as a deed
of reprisal; we have heard of a great army marching off mysteriously
to strike some heavy blow, and lighting up conflagration all along its
way. The last mails add another feature to the savage story. We learn
that eight or nine great fires broke out in New York the same night,
and that they were the work of a body of leagued incendiaries in the
interest of the Confederates. They selected places where numbers of
persons were assembled, some of the localities being places of
amusement, and, but for early discovery, the most frightful carnage
would have been wrought. It is no longer in the mouths of those who
have in any degree aided or abetted in these villanous attempts to
complain of the rough deeds of Federal commanders. Those who could
plan the firing of theatres, where, even if the fire were subdued, the
panic must almost inevitably cause loss of life to women and children,
are beyond the pale of civilisation. It will be useless to endeavour
to lay the crime to the charge of volunteer desperadoes. We have
ourselves read, weeks ago, notice in the Southern papers that such
schemes were in hand; and we observed that they were applauded as a
rightful revenge for atrocities stated--and, we dare say, with
truth--to have been committed by Federal soldiers. In short, the war
has now assumed a character so savage that we cannot but feel that if a
stern military dictator of real genius, of the Napoleonic order, could
arise and could bring the war to a sudden and violent end it would be
well for humanity. The pictures now presented all over the Union, and
what was the Union, are too shocking to be the subject of ordinary
social conversation, and the topic is now put aside with sadness. And
we write this but a few days from another Christmas Day.</p>
<p>At the season now rapidly approaching all who are really open to
the sacred influence of the time will assuredly ask themselves whether
Englishmen have done their duty to their American brethren in regard
to the war. It is enough that at our Christmas we are afraid to talk
of America; it would be unhappy indeed did we feel that any conduct of
ours had conduced to the continuance of the strife, or that any
exertions to terminate it had been wanting on our part. In no
Pharisaical or self-righteous spirit we say that England may approach
her altars and gather round her social boards with no reproach of
conscience in this respect. From the first hour of the war to the
present moment we have been resolutely neutral, while we have lost no
chance of mediation that would not have been construed into
offence. The Foreign Minister of this country has declared, in the
House of Lords, his conviction that the subjugation of the South would
not be for the good of the Union nor for that of the African. To say
that the British press has never expressed exaltation at the
disruption of an empire that had ever menaced us and our colonies is
only to say that the organs of public opinion have been faithful, and
that the spirit of Englishmen has been generous and kindly as of
old. But the press deserves more than negative credit. The Federal
population has never been aided by its own Government to know the real
progress of the war or its various chances; but the English press has
endeavoured to give this information with fidelity, in order to make
our American brethren understand the true character of the work which
their rulers have persuaded them can be accomplished by force. If,
therefore, the North has chosen to commit itself to the war, and to
elect a chief who has since pledged himself to carry it on until one
party shall succumb from exhaustion, the terrible decision has been
arrived at in face of the whole truth, which has been supplied by the
press of England. We will not speak of certain well-meant, if
injudicious, remonstrances which have been addressed to the
Northerners, because we have not approved that kind of interference,
and it is not upon sentimental grounds that a great people should be
asked to alter its policy. The best thing that we could do for our
American brethren was to tell them the truth, which they could not get
from their own statesmen or journalists, and this has been done.</p>
<p>Therefore, we may say without pride, but also without hesitation,
that England has no guilt in respect to this war. At the festival
which is approaching, and when thoughts and words of kindness should
be the rule with all, we shall have little to say of America; but the
lightest-minded will wish, earnestly, that long before another
recurrence of the great feast the sword will have been sheathed. But
beyond this England, as a nation, is not called upon to make her
Christmas sad with American memories. We have done our duty, and we
have a right to the peaceful enjoyment of the feast.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...On Saturday night twenty-five gentlemen, some on the press and
others gathered from the different classes of society, witnessed an
especial s&#xE9;ance with especially provided tests of the Davenport
Brothers. The head of these gentlemen, Mr. Edmund Yates, wrote an
account of this meeting, from which it would appear that the
spiritualists were not quite so successful with these sceptics as with
a mixed company of spectators. The gentlemen retired puzzled but not
satisfied, the conclusion of the chief guest being that in calling the
brothers "sorry mountebanks" he did them great injustice. "I believe
them to be," he continues, "the very cleverest conjurors whose
performances I have ever attended." This judgment is arrived at,
perhaps, after too perfunctory an inspection. In the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi>, Captain Richard Burton has deposed to
some very startling deeds of these conjurors. Whilst suspending his
belief, the great African traveller, who surely is sceptical enough on
most points and who has seen most systems of Indian jugglery, deposes
to hearing strange voices, feeling rough hands, seeing drops of fire
from the ceiling, and beholding all those strange doings in the dark
s&#xE9;ance which have puzzled most of us. Mr. Howitt, in a
recently-published letter, proclaims the ultimate triumph of
spiritualism over the ignorant opposition of a ribald press, to the
writers on which he calls out, "Go ahead, gentlemen, and in a very
short time you will have pilloried yourselves amongst the opponents of
vaccination, electricity, steam, and railroads to the amplest
satisfaction of your very worst enemies."...</p></div2>

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Blackwood's</hi> valuable series of papers on
the Public Schools' Report is concluded with as much ability as it was
commenced. We should be glad to see it reprinted. Both "Cornelius
O'Dowd" and "Tony Butler" somehow fail to amuse this month, and the
number would be dull, but for the American experiences of a cavalry
officer, lately returned from a year's excursion in Secessia. He does
not seem, indeed, to be endowed with any more ample portion of
intellectual brilliancy than is strictly proper in a heavy dragoon;
his description of the great Confederate overthrow at Gettysburg is
tame indeed after Colonel Freemantle's; and, though he seems to have
been on intimate terms with the Secessionist leaders, he seems unable
to relate a single anecdote or convey the most unimportant trait of
character. His simplicity is perfectly astounding, and however
trustworthy his account of what passed under his eyes may be, it is
clear that his inferences from it are not worth a Federal greenback or
even a Confederate one. Still, the nature of his subject will secure
him eager readers, who will be only too thankful for any information,
however meagre and prejudiced. Though devoid of graphic power, he
sometimes indicates the possession of humour, as where he observes,
"When people here mean to speak of a native of Holland they call him
an 'Amsterdam Dutchman,' but when they speak of one of German race
generally they leave out the Amster." There is also a good story of a
wounded Confederate soldier, who, finding he would have to lose his
leg, immediately proceeded to barter the useless boot....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE TOWN AND PORT OF NASSAU.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The </hi>Bahama Islands, though smaller and
less productive than the rest of the British West Indian colonies,
derive a certain political and commercial importance from their
position, more especially since the blockade of the Southern States by
the Federal navy. The port of Nassau, in the island of New Providence,
being at no great distance from the coast of Florida, and commanding
the nearest entrance to the navigation of the Gulf of Mexico; with an
easy run, moreover, to Bermuda on the one hand, or to Wilmington,
South <sic>Carolina</sic>, on the other, has become a great entrep&#xF4;t for
the blockade-breaking trade. We are indebted to an officer of the 1st
West India Regiment, stationed at this place, for a View of the town
and harbour, which we have engraved. It is taken from the verandah of
the mess-house of the officers of that regiment, and gives a correct
general idea of the place and its buildings. The large gate in the
foreground is the entrance to the grounds of Government House. The
cathedral is in the centre of the View. The two long buildings seen
beyond the cottages in the foreground are the barracks. The harbour is
very spacious, and formed by the long strip of rocky ground called
"Hog Island," on which coal d&#xE9;p&#xF4;ts have recently been
formed, so as to prevent the quays being occupied by the vast store of
coal required for the steamers. There is also a dock, in which a
"blockader" is seen undergoing repair. The vessel seen beyond the
cathedral tower is the Lizzie, built on the Clyde, an Engraving of
which was lately published in our Journal. She was sold the other day
at Nassau to a merchant at Havannah. Another blockade-runner is just
crossing the bar and coming into port with colours flying, denoting a
successful run; while on the horizon we see another just off to
"Dixie." These little steamers are painted a light grey, or nearly
white, which renders them almost invisible at a distance, and they
glide noiselessly over the water; yet it is a common thing, now that
the Northerners have made the blockade of Wilmington so rigid, to see
the steamers come into the port of Nassau with their masts shot away
or their hulls pierced by shot. The population of Nassau is now
threefold what it was before the blockade, comprising people of all
nations and every class; and many large fortunes have been made,
especially by those who engaged early in the traffic; but the crowded
state of the town, together with the cases of yellow fever brought
here by the shipping, has caused that fearful disease to prevail at
Nassau more during the last summer than m previous years. Several
cases have occurred among the officers of the garrison, but only two
have proved fatal. As might be expected, house rent in the town is
enormously high just now; and so is the price of provisions, which are
chiefly imported from home, since their export from New York is
prohibited, lest they should be sent into the Southern States to
supply the Confederate army.</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Nova Scotian and the Etna we have
intelligence from New York to the 3rd inst.</p>
<p>The chief news brought is the announcement that there had been a 
severe engagement between the hostile armies in Tennessee. The Federal
General Schofield reports that, on the afternoon of the 30th ult., two
corps of General Hood's army attacked Franklin, but were repulsed at
all points by him, with the loss, on the enemy's side, of 5000 or 6000
men, including 1000 prisoners; while the Federals' loss was only a
quarter of that sustained by their assailants. Nevertheless, General
Schofield retired during the night from Franklin towards a position
three miles south of Nashville; and on the following morning the
victorious and retreating Federals were closely followed by the
defeated and pursuing Confederates. Heavy skirmishing was progressing
and a general engagement was expected<pb n="599"/> while Federal
reinforcements were arriving at Nashville, where the forts and
intrenchments were manned by the garrison and the Government
labourers, who had been armed.</p>
<p>The exact position of Sherman in Georgia is still
uncertain. According to some accounts he had been repulsed in an
attempt to cross the Oconnee River, while others state that his main
army had succeeded in crossing that river, and, avoiding Augusta and
all the other large towns, was making the best of its way to the
seacoast. The Confederates were rapidly concentrating their forces,
and were bent on the destruction of the invading army. It was said
that they had defeated the advance cavalry of Sherman in an attempt to
open communication with Beaufort. The <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi>
correspondent states that the defeat of Sherman's cavalry took place
near the Savannah River. It was reported that General Burnside, with
20,000 men, had sailed from Fort Monroe for the purpose of landing at
some point on the Southern coast and joining General Sherman.</p>
<p>General Grant had sent General Gregg's cavalry on a
reconnaissance, for the purpose of ascertaining whether General Lee
was sending any troops from his army to Augusta. General Gregg took
and destroyed Stoney Creek station, but failed to obtain any
information, and was closely followed by the Confederates during his
retreat to the Federal camp.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi> says that President
Lincoln's Message (delivered to Congress ere this) is conservative in
character, and will aim at the conciliation of all parties and classes
in the North. President Lincoln, it is said, "repudiates the factions
which would establish the present conflict upon a sectional basis, and
takes strong national ground upon which Democrats and Conservative
Republicans can have have no hesitation to stand and rally. He has
been induced to adopt this policy by Mr. Seward, whose efforts have
been to unite in a common cause the Conservatives of all parties, and
to form out of these elements a new party which will sweep Greeley and
the Radicals out of existence." The principal part of the message
relates to the present condition of the finances of the country, and
to the measures calculated to prevent it from growing worse.</p>
<p>The examination of the persons suspected of firing the hotels in
New York was begun, by a military commission, on the 2nd inst.</p>
<p>Governor Seymour has declined to receive the British peace
address, but referred Mr. Barker to Secretary Seward, who also
declined it, and likewise refused him an interview with
Mr. Lincoln. Barker now proposes presenting the address to
Congress.</p>
<p>The Florida (forcibly taken from Brazilian waters) has been run
into and sunk by a Federal transport-steamer off Fort Monroe. It was
rumoured she would be accidentally burnt. The <hi rend="italic">Express</hi> regards it as a strange and curious affair,
and thinks it will add to existing complications. The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> says the pretence of an accident is too
transparent to deceive anybody. The <hi rend="italic">News</hi> thinks
she was sunk designedly, and adds that the sinking does not cancel the
duty of indemnity. The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> says the question
is yet open as regards the right or wrong of the seizure, but contends
that thus far there is no ground for complaint. Admiral Buchanan and
the officers of the Florida have been sent to Fort Warren.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has issued a proclamation announcing the
ratification of the treaty with Belgium extinguishing the Scheldt
dues.</p>
<p>It is reported that both the Chickamauga and Tallahassee had
arrived safely at Wilmington, and that the latter was about to depart
for Bermuda with a cargo of cotton. There were twenty-one
blockade-runners at Nassau on Nov. 12. The schooner Albert Edward was
captured while attempting to get out of Galveston, Texas, with a cargo
of 150 bales of cotton.</p>
<p>Gold, on Dec. 3, was quoted at 229.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress had unanimously rejected the peace
propositions laid before it.</p></div2>

ult. It has bean the work of eighteen years' labour, and has cost
nearly 500,000 dols. Three archbishops, ten bishops, the mitred Abbot
of St. Vincent's at Latrobe, and more than 200 priests entered the
cathedral during the processional chant. The ceremonies were attended

assert that his portly, well-illustrated volume is likely to be

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Action of Oil Wells</hi> has been examined
by Professor E. W. Evans, of Marietta College, Ohio, U.S., and the
results are given in Dr. Silliman's <hi rend="italic">American Journal
of Science</hi>. We can only select a few points. The principal
supplies of petroleum are not diffused between the planes of
stratification, but are collected in cavities more or less sunken in
the strata; whence the oil is less liable to be carried away by running
water. It is common to find large quantities in places where there are
marks of disturbance and displacement of the rocks. The cavities have
been probably caused sometimes by uplifts and sometimes by erosion and
the dissolving action of water; but, whatever may be their origin,
they are not usually of very great horizontal extent. On Oil Creek, in
Pennsylvania, the greatest quantities of oil are found in the
horizontal stratum of sandstone. It would seem that this rock is very
porous, and perforated, like a honeycomb, with numerous cells and
fissures containing petroleum. The history of many of the wells is as
follows:--When oil is entered the gas begins to raise it up over the
top of the boring, increasing gradually in force until it projects it
into the air often to a height of 40 ft. or 50 ft.; then alternately
diminishing and increasing in force at regular intervals, but without
any cessation in the flow for a long time. These variations in the
force of the gas (the breathings of the earth as they are called) are
to be explained on the same principle as before, by supposing that as
the tension of the gas is relaxed by the removal of oil, the gas and
oil from other cavities around rush in through the pores and slight
fissures till a certain maximum tension is reached and the influx
ceases; then by the expansion of gas already in the chamber the oil
continues to come up, but with a diminishing flow, until a relative
vacuum is again created; after which the influx is renewed and
gradually increases as at the beginning. These regular alternations vary
in different wells from two or three times a day to as many times an
hour, the intervals, however, gradually increasing in length as the
supply of oil is diminished--unless, as sometimes happens, new
communications are forced, and the well, deriving new supplies, starts
off again with a new period. It often happens that the same well has
two periods--one of variation in the flow, and another of cessation,
consequent on the escape of gas. A more uniform flow may be secured by
making the orifice at the mouth of the tube smaller. This is often
desirable in order to prevent the escape of gas by the exhaustion of
the oil in the cavity down to the bottom of the boring. Sometimes such
a quantity will thus rush out, before the oil raised up by the water
closes the passage again, as not only to render the pump necessary after
that to raise oil, but also to diminish materially the influx of oil
from other cavities by reducing the pressure of the gas in them. Oil
wells commonly vary in depth from 100 ft. to 800 ft. The deepest are as
apt to raise oil to the surface as the shallowest. This indicates a
greater compression of the gas at the greater depth--owing, doubtless,
to its connection with higher columns of water. The activity of some
wells is increased by rains; others, with less gas, are rendered
unproductive till the water can be reduced.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>The United States Congress reassembled at Washington on the 5th
inst., but the President's Message was not communicated until the
6th.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln declares that no attempts to negotiate with the South
can result in any good, as the South will not be satisfied with any
conditions but a severance of the Union, which the North cannot and
will not grant. The Southerners can, he adds, obtain peace whenever
they choose by laying down their arms and submitting to the national
authority. He will retract nothing that he has said regarding slavery,
and will not modify his emancipation proclamation. He recommends
Congress to pass a law abolishing slavery for ever throughout the
United States and their territories. The foreign affairs of the United
States are in a condition which is reasonably satisfactory, though
unforeseen political difficulties have arisen in British and Brazilian
ports, and on the northern frontier of the Union, which have required
a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the United States and
the nations interested. He deems it expedient, in consequence of
recent events on the northern frontier, that the Federal cruisers on
the great Lakes shall be increased, and that, therefore, the six
months' notice stipulated by treaty be given to Great Britain. During
the campaign, the lines and positions previously occupied by the
Federal armies have been maintained, and further advances have been
made. The navy comprises 670 vessels, and have, during the year,
captured 324 vessels. The finances have been successfully
administered; but further taxation is expedient, and the Federal debt,
which amounted to 1,740,000,000 dols. on the 1st of July last, will
probably be increased 500,000,000 dols. by another year of war. The
emancipation legislation of Maryland is mentioned with approbation;
and the fact that Louisiana and Arkansas have formed a loyal State
Government is also alluded to. Such is the substance of President
Lincoln's Message.</p>
<p>The report of the Secretary of the Treasury says that the expenses
to be provided for during the current year, including the interest of
the public debt, amount to 1,400,000,000 dols. The customs, internal
revenue, and the miscellaneous sources are estimated to produce
780,000,000 dols.; leaving a balance of 620,000,000 dols. to be
provided for. Further measures reduce this increase of the public debt
during the current year to 482,000,000 dols. It is estimated that the
pubic debt on July 1, 1865, will be 2,223,000,000 dols. This
expenditure in the next fiscal year is estimated at 1,168,000,000
dols., and the receipts at 396,000,000 dols. The balance in the
treasury is 350,000,000 dols., leaving 422,000,000 dols. to he
provided for by loans. Mr. Fessenden is opposed to the negotiation of
a foreign loan, and will not resort to a further issue of legal tender
notes as long as the people support the war by loans. The amount of
interest payable in gold by the Government is 56,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>A Washington despatch, dated the 6th inst., published in the
Boston papers, says:--"The President's Message seems to be approved by
both Radical and Conservative Republicans in Congress. The reading in
the house was accompanied by enthusiastic demonstrations."</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives notices have been given of various
bills, including one to regulate the value of money, another to
prohibit the exportation of gold or silver coin, and another to
prevent gold and silver coin and bullion from being paid or accepted
for greater value than their real current value.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons took his leave of the President and Secretary Seward on
the 6th inst., previously to his contemplated visit to
England. Mr. J. Hume Burnley will have charge of the British Legation
during the absence of Lord Lyons.</p>
<p>Ex-Secretary Chase has been nominated and confirmed Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
<p>General Sherman, with a good deal of hard fighting, had passed
Millen, which he was unable to take, and was supposed to be making for
Darien. The Southern papers say that should he succeed in reaching the
coast it will be with the loss of half his army.</p>
<p>The Federal General Thomas had concentrated his forces within
Nashville in anticipation of the attack by General Hood, who was
erecting breastworks before the city.</p>
<p>The Federals under General Burbridge had evacuated Cumberland Gap,
and were reported to be advancing against Breckenridge. The Southern
accounts assert that he was retreating to Knoxville.</p>

Saturday, December</hi> 24, 1864.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Divided </hi>into thirty-nine articles, the
Message of the newly re-elected President of the Federal States is
presented for our consideration this Christmas. The document does not
contain much which will interest the English reader; but there are
numerous details, which, though unexciting to us, are obviously of
local importance, and will probably be the text for many rough sermons
in the districts to which they refer. The first mention of this
country is of a complimentary kind, and recognises the good will and
support which the Government of Great Britain extends to the American
project for an overland telegraph by way of <sic>Behring's</sic> Strait and
Asiatic Russia. There is also a hopeful reference to the revival of
the scheme for the Atlantic telegraph. The two great nations, having
once spoken to each other across the sea, seem bound in honour not to
be silenced, and we may yet hope that Christmas greetings may be
flashed and returned by the marvellous wire. The next allusion to
ourselves is of a graver kind. Both nations disarmed upon the Lakes;
but the American Government alleges that the assaults and depredations
committed in the region adjacent to the Canadian border by inimical
and desperate persons who are harboured there make it necessary to
increase the Federal armament upon those waters; and England is to
receive the six months' notice necessary before that can be
effected. The President, however, does us the justice to disavow any
idea that the Colonial Government is intentionally unjust or
unfriendly. We are not otherwise alluded to, except in the general
mention that most of the European States manifest a liberal
disposition towards the American policy of inviting immigrants, in
regard to whom Mr. Lincoln is desirous that it should be fully
manifest that he neither needs, nor designs to impose, involuntary
military service.</p>
<p>We may say, but in no disrespectful way, that the greater part of
the Message is an exemplification of that "cracking-up" which our
Transatlantic brethren like. We do the same kind of thing here at
times, but it is in a mild and modest way. Everybody likes to be
praised, and those who succeed most in life are usually found to be
those who have always a good word for everybody. The Message, as
regards the Federals, is all good words. The finances are successful;
the public debt, though large, is not oppressive, and the citizens owe
it "to themselves;" and in connection with it is to be formed a system
for creating funded property to be exempt from taxation and from
seizure for debts. The national banks work admirably. The navy
consists of 671 vessels, carrying 4610 guns. National growth and
improvement have scarcely been checked by the war; a new State--that
of Nevada--has been added to the Union, and the territories are
rapidly prospering. The Atlantic and Pacific States are to be joined
by railways and telegraphs; the mines have produced at least a million
of dollars; agriculture is advancing, and citizens in Arkansas and
Louisiana have organised loyal State Governments. The President adds,
exultingly, that Maryland is secure to liberty and the Union for ever,
and so the spirited Confederate hymn, which has become a Southern
national song may cease-</p><q>She wakes, she stirs, she is not
dumb.<lb/>Hurra! she spurns the Northern scum;<lb/>She breathes, she
burns, she'll come, she'll come,<lb/>Maryland, my Maryland!</q>
<p>The recital of American endurance and achievement must be admitted
by the most unfavourable critic to contain much which challenges the
admiration of the world. Nowhere better than in England is understood
the reliance which a true statesman reposes in the "elasticity" of a
great people, and that quality is marvellously manifested in the
Federal States. <hi rend="italic">Si sic omnia. </hi>But the rest of
the Message is bellicose in the extreme. Mr. Lincoln, like Cacus,
breathes nothing but flames. He refers proudly to the popular election
which placed him once more at the head of the nation, with a fierce
war-cry, and he proclaims his resolve to execute the vengeance of the
North. There can be no use in negotiation. The "insurgent leader" has
no views of peace. He must be "beaten." The rebels can have peace at
any moment by laying down their arms and submitting, as many have
done, and the door is still open to all. Even the excepted classes
know that they may count upon special mercy. But the time may come,
and probably will, when that door must be closed, and more rigorous
measures be adopted. Mr. Lincoln retracts nothing that he has said as
to slavery; he will never retract or modify the emancipation
proclamation; he will never return to slavery anyone who has been
freed thereby, or by any act of Congress; and if the people should
ever wish such re-enslavement, they must find some other person than
himself to carry it out.</p>
<p>So, as we come to our Christmas altars and hearths, our brethren
again raise the shout of war; and their grand topic of the day is the
fierce rush of Sherman through towns which he leaves in flames; the
grand hope of the day that he will force his way to the sea and
suddenly descend in thunder upon one of the great cities of the
South. May we have a far different record for our next Christmas
Number! "Give peace in our time" will not be the least earnest of the
Christmas prayers in England.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It </hi>seems but a week since we heard a
Message from his Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
States, read in the Senate House at Washington. But, lo! a whole year
has passed, and again the newspapers overflow with the interminable
paragraphs of a document which from its very nature must be drouthy and
verbose. There are three noticeable features in Mr. Lincoln's
voluminous Message. First, that he holds out no hope of any
negotiations for peace being fostered by the North. The initiative
must be set--if it be set at all--south of Mason and Dixon's
line. Next; that, in the presence of a currency almost inconceivably
depreciated, and of a public debt which it is estimated will next July
reach the sum of five hundred millions sterling, he declares the
resources of the United States to be inexhaustible; and, lastly, that
he holds out an implied threat against Great Britain, by proclaiming
that measures will be taken to place armed vessels on Lake Erie and
Lake Ontario to protect the soil of the United States against raiders
from Canada. American gun-boats on the St. Lawrence may be the next
step, and then a blockade of the Mersey and the Clyde and the
Southampton water may follow. The only possibly dignified answer which
Great Britain could return under such circumstances would be,
"Certainly. Bring out your gunboats; but we will likewise bring out
ours, and keep the peace together." For American war steamers to have
the right, whenever they chose, to poke their noses into Hamilton,
Kingston, and Toronto, and, perhaps, get down as far as Montreal or
Quebec would be intolerable, and would certainly provoke, ere long,
that collision with the Canadian people which the Government of the
United States profess to be so anxious to avert....</p>
<p>The Davenport Brothers would appear to be irrepressible. A Doctor
Nicholls has written to the papers to repeat that the brethren desire
only a fair scientific or practical examination, and are ready at any
time, and under any penalty, to prove what they assert--that the
manifestations in their presence are not the result of trick,
confederacy, or any kind of imposture. They are prepared, they say, to
meet a select committee fairly chosen, at any place, except
St. James's Hall or the Hanover-square Rooms, and to place &#xA3;250
at its disposal for any charitable purpose if the verdict be against
them. This is all very well as far as it goes; but the agents of the
brethren have resorted to the somewhat indecorous proceeding of
sending circulars round to a number of literary and scientific
persons, in which, without a "with your leave" or a "by your leave,"
they are nominated as members of a certain "test committee." We find
our own name in one of these circulars; and although we are in very
good company--Mr. Dickens, Mr. Hepworth Dixon, Mr. Lewes, Mr. Thornton
Hunt, Mr. Tom Taylor, and many others being also enumerated--we must
emphatically protest against being made a "medium" for advertising
purposes by the proprietors of a show. Let those who choose puzzle
themselves with "spiritual investigations." The material exigencies of
attempting to earn an honest living are quite enough for us. The
Davenports are, we dare say, very wonderful people; but we are rather
<hi rend="italic">blas&#xE9; </hi>with wonders. We have seen
Simmonds cut off his own head, and Heller devour his own hat. We have
listened to the pythoness, Cora Hatch. We have heard of a young man in
the State of Indiana who can jump down his own throat; and if we gave
any preference to a wonder-worker just now, it would be to one who
could tell us how to prevent the pipes freezing, or who could bring
the chartered gas companies to a sense of common honesty with regard
to the article they supply....</p></div2>

<p>By the last American mail a letter, which is remarkable both as a
documentary curiosity and as a specimen of manufacturing skill, was
received by the <hi rend="italic">Birmingham Journal</hi>. It is
written on iron, rolled so thin that the sheet is only twice the
weight of a similar sheet of ordinary notepaper. The letter is dated
"South Pittsburg (Pennsylvania), Nov. 6, 1864," and says, "In the
number of your paper dated Oct. 1, 1864, there is an article setting
forth that John Brown and Co., of the Atlas Works, Sheffield, had
succeeded in rolling a plate of iron 13&#xBD;in. thick. I believe
that to be the thickest plate ever rolled. I send you this specimen of
iron made at the Sligo ironworks, Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, as the
thinnest iron ever rolled in the world up to this time, which iron I
challenge all England to surpass for strength and tenuity. This, I
believe, will be the first iron letter that ever crossed the Atlantic
Ocean.--Yours, &#x0026;c., <hi rend="smallcaps">John C. Evans</hi>." The
iron is said to be of exceedingly fine quality, and the sheet is by
far the thinnest ever seen in this country. The letter will be
deposited in the museum of the Midland Institute. Tested by one of
Holtzappfel's gauges, the thickness of the sheet is found to be the
1000th part of an inch. A sheet of Belgian iron, supposed hitherto to
be the thinnest yet rolled, is the 666th part of an inch thick, and
the thickness of an ordinary sheet of notepaper is about the 400th
part of an inch.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAST DAY OF THE YEAR.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">To-night </hi>the year 1864 will come to an
end. Englishmen are not much given to sentimentality; but if there be
a time when there falls a shade or two of pensiveness on the
swift-moving current of their thoughts, it is when they watch "the Old
Year out." There is generally a touch of pathos upon the countenance
whenever we are conscious of taking our last look of anything,
especially when that thing is a definite and considerable segment of
our lifetime. The particular year the final disappearance of which we
await may not have connected itself with our feelings by any strong
ties of association. It may have been to us a mere continuation of
time, without a single salient feature upon which retrospection can
dwell with interest. The staple of its character may not have risen
above a dead level of humdrum and routine. But when the hour of
parting arrives we grow serious, and slide almost insensibly into the
reflective mood. We instinctively cast a glance back at the good and
evil the year has disclosed during its course, and it is not without
some stir of the inner man that we bid it "Farewell, for ever!"</p>
<p>Whatever materials for reflection the year 1864 may present to
individuals and families, it has certainly not lacked interest as far
as nations are concerned. Great events, both in the Eastern and
Western Hemispheres, have marked its progress. While we in this
country have been affected by no violent changes, and have been
conscious of no shock to public feeling, save such as were occasioned
by the vibration following upon startling events abroad, neither
continental Europe nor republican North America has got through the
year without visible agitations and strong excitement. The map of
Europe has been altered, but not by France. Germany, which up to the
beginning of 1864 had usually been regarded as among the strongest,
the slowest, and the most pacific Powers, suddenly snatched up arms,
within a few days of the birth of the year, and, before its close,
wrested Schleswig Holstein from Denmark by the boldest and baldest
application in modern times of the law of might. Russia has erased
Poland from the list of nations, besides depopulating
Circassia. England has quietly transferred the Ionian Islands to the
little kingdom of Greece. Italy has made only a prospective change;
but by the removal of her capital to Florence she has sealed the
Franco-Italian Convention, and quietly waits the moment when, by the
stipulated recall of the French army of occupation from Rome, the
estates of the Supreme Pontiff will drop into her hands, and no part
of her soil but Venetia will remain under a foreign sway. The Danubian
Principalities, following the lead of Prince Couza, an able
adventurer, have reduced the tie which binds them to Turkey to an
almost imperceptible thread, and, but for diplomatic restraints, would
speedily and openly proclaim their independence. The year just about
to be consigned to the sepulchre of the past has seen the initiation
of great changes. What year will see the end of them, and what the end
will be, the future only can disclose.</p>
<p>Glancing from Europe to the West we also catch sight of stirring
events. The erection of a new Imperial throne in Mexico, under the
auspices of the French Emperor, and the enthusiastic welcome accorded
to Maximilian, the brother of Francis Joseph of Austria, quickens in
European minds a reasonable hope that that hitherto distracted
country, occupying a splendid position, and rich beyond calculation in
its natural resources, may henceforth enjoy the internal security
requisite for the development of a peaceful and prosperous empire. On
the other hand, the Confederation of the British provinces of America,
under one constitutional system and one central Government--a
consummation all but actually completed--warrants sanguine
expectations of a flattering future for an<pb n="662"/> empire in the
north, built up in a more rugged clime, and with hardier and, perhaps,
more enduring materials. It is between the two, over the vast space
covered by the United States, that the retrospect of the year assumes
its most dismal hues. The close of 1864 leaves the civil contest
between North and South apparently as undecided as it stood at the
commencement. The re-election of Mr. Lincoln is a popular Federal vote
for the continuance of the struggle. Victory oscillates with strange
impartiality between the combatants, giving, perhaps, a slight balance
of advantage to the North, but scarcely affording foothold for the
hope that the war is near its termination. Yet, even here, it is not
unmingled darkness. The same national vote that re-seated Mr. Lincoln
in the presidential chair determined upon cleansing from the
Constitution the stain of slavery; and there can be little doubt that,
whatever may be the final issue of the pending conflict, the "peculiar
domestic institution" will perish in the awful struggle which it has
occasioned....</p></div2>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>The news from New York, to the 17th inst., is of great
importance.</p>
<p>The Richmond journals state that, on the 14th inst., General
Sherman carried by storm Fort MacAllister, a fortification on Ogeechee
River, fifteen miles south-west of Savannah. The fort was only
occupied by a garrison of 150 men; but its occupation enabled General
Sherman's army to communicate with the Federal fleet and necessitated
the reinforcement of Savannah. A Federal steamer, which left
Charleston Bar on the 14th inst., had brought to New York a report
that General Sherman, after eight hours' fighting, had taken the city
of Savannah, with 11,000 prisoners; but the <hi rend="italic">Richmond
Examiner</hi> stated that, up to the 13th inst., the Federal army had
made no attack on Savannah, which was defended by a triple line of
works. The railway communication between Savannah and Charleston
apparently continued to be intercepted by the Federal corps under
General Foster; for the Savannah journals stated that General Foster
advanced towards Coosawhatchie on the 5th inst. and burned a bridge,
but was twice driven back by the Confederates.</p>
<p>From Tennessee, also, there is news unfavourable to the Confederate
cause. General Hood, who, in spite of his late defeat, had pressed
upon the Federals and shut up their army in Nashville, has, according
to Northern accounts, been defeated with great loss by his opponent,
General Thomas. That commander reports that he attacked the
Confederates, on the 15th and 16th inst., and drove them a
considerable distance, capturing from 3000 to 5000 prisoners and from
thirty to forty cannon. Another disaster menaced the defeated
General's army, the Federal expedition dispatched from Vicksburg and
Baton Rouge to cut off his communication with Mobile having been
entirely successful.</p><pb n="663"/>
<p>The Federal General Stoneman has made a raid in the Confederate
General Breckenridge's rear, and, after capturing Bristol, Abingdon,
and Glade Springs, in Western Virginia, is marching towards
Saltville.</p>
<p>A naval and military expedition, under the command of Admiral
Porter and General Butler, sailed from Fort Monroe on the 12th inst.,
and was supposed to be destined for Wilmington.</p>
<p>The St. Albans raiders have been released by Judge Coursol, of
Montreal, on the ground that the Court had no jurisdiction. The
discharge of the St. Albans raiders was held wrong by the law advisers
of the Canadian Government, and warrants had been issued for their
re-apprehension. Stipendiary magistrates have been appointed by the
Canadian Government to take cognisance of breaches of international
law on the frontier. Major-General Dix has ordered the Federal
commanders on the frontier to shoot any raiders if they could, to
pursue them into British territory if they should take refuge there,
to capture them there if possible, and not to surrender them to the
British authorities, but to send them for trial by court-martial at
New York. Resolutions denouncing the conduct of the Canadians, and
directing the Secretary of State to demand from the British Government
payment for all cargoes and ships destroyed by British piratical
vessels, have been introduced into Congress and referred to the
Committee for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed a resolution to give notice
to England of the abrogation of the Canadian reciprocity treaty.</p>
<p>According to the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, the
Brazilian demand for satisfaction for the seizure of the Florida was
insolent in tone; but Secretary Seward's reply is firm and
conciliatory, does not indorse the seizure, and expresses a desire
that the matter should be fairly and satisfactorily adjusted.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> states that there is a
good prospect of the passage through the House of the constitutional
amendment to abolish slavery.</p>
<p>The latest quotation of gold at New York was 128 per cent

Saturday, December</hi> 31, 1864.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">American</hi> news, at the close of the year,
is very interesting in itself, and seems to have a still graver
interest for this country. It is quite on the cards that, without much
prudence and forbearance on the part of the Governments of England and
of the Federal States, complications will arise which may produce a
rupture. Enraged at the liberation of the raiders and ruffians of
St. Albans, General Dix, without waiting to hear whether the decision
of the French-Canadian Judge was to be reviewed by the Executive,
issued orders that, in future, any such outrages were to be chastised
by the slaughter of the offenders, wherever they might be found, and
that they were to be followed into the territories of the Queen of
England, without any regard to frontier rights. Now, it happens that
the Canadians have no more sympathy with these scoundrels than we
have, and also that the judgment has been set aside, the Judge
apprised that he was wrong, and orders had been given for the
re-arrest of the men, if they have not been wise enough to get out of
the way. But, whether this had been the case or not, it is clear that
Dix's act must be disavowed by the President, and that, if his orders
have been obeyed in the slightest degree, apology is due from the
American Government. Whether the decision of a regular law court be
right or wrong, it is not to be borne that it should be followed by a
military outrage. But there is more. The Federal papers do not scruple
to say that Mr. Lincoln meditates war with this country. They assert
that he intends to quarrel with us, in order to have a good excuse for
terminating the struggle with the obstinate Confederates, whom he may
occasionally beat in battle, but cannot subdue. We meet these
assertions, as we have a right to do with an expression of total
disbelief in their truth. Hitherto, even when our relations with the
Union have been most unpleasant, the Government of the States has
manifested a readiness to believe in the honesty of our conduct, and
we have given Mr. Seward no reason that justifies his abandonment of
that belief. We are blameless in the matter. Moreover, the ink is
scarcely dry upon our reprint of the President's solemn declaration
that the war shall proceed until one party succumb. We have no right
to insult the chosen head of a great nation by assuming that he
meditated treachery towards a friendly Power. We do not even put a
harsh construction on the notice to terminate the treaty in respect of
the lake armaments. It places us at a disadvantage; but the Americans
are within the letter of the agreement, and we have no right to
complain. It may be well that they should distinctly understand that,
whatever may be the rabid utterances of a portion of our own press,
which almost rivals their own in recklessness of assertion and<pb n="667"/> want of reticence and good taste, the thoughtful and
respectable portion of English society has at present no belief that
the Government of Washington contemplates a crime.</p>
<p>Assuredly we have no intention of meeting swagger by swagger. We
are not inclined to boast of what we could do if a rupture should take
place. The American Government knows this as well as Earl Russell
does. Canada would at first suffer, especially if the new war should
be conducted in the spirit in which certain of the Northern generals
have acted towards men who were the other day fellow-citizens of those
who now ravage the Southern districts. England herself is rarely
herself at the outset of war. But who doubts the issue? The Union
would be at an end forever. Our instant recognition of the Confederacy
would be followed by the pouring through its harbours, whose blockade
we should go through as through paper, such armaments as would
speedily turn the fortunes of the war, and, aided by the re-invigorated
and vengeful Southerns, we should sweep Federalism from the South as
we swept Napoleonism from the Peninsula. And we should soon place
Canada in a position to hurl back the invaders, no matter what early
successes they might have gained. But it is undesirable to dwell on
possibilities which we hope and believe will never arise. Assured that
the American Government comprehends the whole question, and assured
also that the better portion of the people in both countries would
denounce the wickedness of a needless war, we would leave the
disagreeable question which has just arisen to the solution of
honourable diplomacy.</p>
<p>The end of the year has brought triumphs to the Federal arms. We
are imperfectly informed as to the exact position of General Sherman,
but there is reason to believe that Savannah has fallen. He had
certainly stormed and taken its ill-manned but gallantly-defended
fortress, Fort M'Allister. The rest of the account is but rumour, but
there are reasons for thinking the rumour correct. At all events,
after a very masterly display of strategy during his "retreat," by
menacing one enemy and another, and bewildering all, Sherman has made
his way to the sea, and is in communication with Admiral Dahlgren's
squadron. If Savannah be not reduced, it has been formidably
besieged. We are informed, however, that its defences are strong, and,
supposing that it has not been seized at a coup-de-main by Sherman, his
work may yet be heavy. We also hear that General Thomas has bided his
time, <hi rend="italic">more suo</hi>, until he could strike at Hood
with effect, and that he has struck heavily, routed the valiant but
not over-skilled Confederate leader, and captured many prisoners and
guns. The last advices left him about to follow up his blow; but this
sequel is not always one in which the assailant is successful. A real
"victory" is, nevertheless, claimed. The Wilmington expedition has
also been dispatched at last, and the description of the armament is
very imposing. Wilmington would be a far more valuable acquisition
than Savannah, and both sides are well aware of this, and will make
proportionate efforts. But, taking the whole state of the war into
account, the close of the year brings renown to the Federal generals
and discouragement to their adversaries, though the value of the
victories, taken at their highest, is not great as bearing upon the
issue of the war. City after city may surrender, but Confederatism
will not surrender; and the Union will need almost as many garrisons
as it can number of conquered towns if it is to hold its dearly-bought
prizes. The spirit of the South is said to be unbroken. Sherman's
march has revealed some of the weakness of the Confederate chances;
but in the face of all this the great army of the North is defied, and
can do nothing while the successes of its other armies are won only by
desperately hard work and frequent and fierce fighting. We are
strangely misinformed as to the resources of the South if the
exhaustion of which we hear so much has brought it to a moribund
state.</p>
<p>Setting entirely aside the irritating topic which has newly arisen,
treating as spiteful bluster the menaces of some of the Federal
organs, and refusing to believe, with others, that the Chief of the
Union is planning treachery, we unhesitatingly recur to the
declarations which we have repeatedly made on behalf of the better
classes in England--namely, that we earnestly desire to see the
Americans at peace. We trust to close our record of the in-coming year
with an allusion to the conclusion of the most hideous and irrational
war hitherto noticed in history. That a still more hideous and
irrational war will succeed it we have too much faith in a
superintending Providence to believe.</p></div2>

<p>Lord Wharncliffe writes that the refusal of the Federal Government
to distribute the money raised for the Confederate prisoners will not
practically affect the distribution of the fund, "for which," he says,
"unhappily, we can find but too many
recipients."</p></div2></div1></body>
