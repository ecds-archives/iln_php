The United States' mail-steamer Fulton has arrived at Southampton,
bringing New York journals to the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND</p>

<p>The blockade is now effective at all the principal ports of the
Southern coast.  The first Confederate privateer Savannah, whose
arrival at New York in charge of a prize crew we reported in our last,
was captured by the man-of-war Perry off the coast of South Carolina.
Her crew, numbering sixteen, are in irons on board the Minnesota, now
blockading Charleston.  The New York Tribune urges that these men be
hanged.  The Savannah was the first ship which applied for letters of
marque.  She had just captured and sent to Georgetown a Maine brig
before she encountered the Perry.  There have been several more
captures on the Potomac of Virginia coasting-vessels which were
engaged in supplying the Confederates with provisions.</p>

<p>There has been no movement of importance in the neighbourhood of
Fortress Monroe.  An Ohio regiment which went reconnoitring in a
railway train was fired upon at Vienna, fifteen miles west of
Alexandria, by a masked battery, and retired with a loss of twenty
men.  They were reinforced and returned, and found that the enemy had
disappeared.  This affair, in conjunction with the former check at
Great Bethel, has caused a great outcry against "militia officers,"
and a reaction of public opinion in favour of professional
commanders.</p>

<p>In the direction of Fairfax the Federals have pushed forward from
Alexandria four miles.  The enemy's pickets fell back on Fairfax.</p>

<p>The Confederate troops, under the command of General Johnson, who
lately evacuated Harper's Ferry, and were supposed to have retired
towards Richmond, suddenly reappeared on the Potomac at Piedmont,
considerably to the west of Harper's Ferry.  They forced the bridge
over the Potomac, which was guarded by forty loyal Marylanders, who
were all cut to pieces except two, and then advanced to Cumberland, in
Western Maryland, where they surrounded an Indiana regiment stationed
there.  Two Pennsylvania regiments have been sent forward from
Harrisburg to relieve this regiment, if possible.  If they have
capitulated this will be by far the greatest success of the
Confederate forces since the opening of the war.</p>

<p>The State of Missouri, which is loyal to the Union, has been the seat
of a series of scattered fights.  The parties to it are not the armies
of the Confederate and the United States, but the State militia of
Missouri and Federal volunteers of the same state, Illinois, and Iowa.
The Iowa troops have invaded this populous and flourishing State in
the west, and the Illinoisans have done so in the east.  General Lyon
is the Federal commander.  He has utterly routed the State troops at
Bonneville, a town a few miles north-west of the capital, and taken
their camp.  The loss of the vanquished was at first set down at three
hundred, but this is an exaggeration.  The Governor of the State fled
from the field in a southerly direction.  A few days afterwards a body
of the militia attacked the Union Home Guard of the town of Cole, and
drove them from the place with great loss.  There have been several
minor collisions in this afflicted State.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The New York journals continue to receive telegrams from the South
by way of Louisville, the chief city of the neutral State of Kentucky,
at which place Southern journals are still received.  A company has
recently been started in the same city to maintain postal
communication between the people of the two Confederations.  It offers
to deliver a letter of ordinary weight for 23 cents (11 1/2 d.).  The
previous rate was 3 cents.</p>

<p>By way of Louisville we learn that the South feels pinched for the
want of salt, printing-paper, lead, and leather.  The Southerners and
their slaves are in great want of new shoes.</p>

<p>In his reply to the Commissioners of the Maryland Legislature,
Mr. Davis reiterates his desire for peace, and declares that conquest
is inconsistent with that idea of State sovereignty which is the
fundamental principle of the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>The vote on secession in Tennessee is-for separation, 99,269;
against it, 14,206.  East Tennessee gave a majority of 13,177 against
seceding.  A Convention of East Tennesseans has been called to meet at
Knoxville, to deliberate on the advisability of resisting the
authority of the Confederate Government.</p>

<p rend="center">MARYLAND AND WEST VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Maryland have passed resolutions to the effect
that the war debt now being contracted by the Federal Government is
unconstitutionally incurred, and that Maryland will not hold herself
bound for any portion thereof.</p>

<p>The Wheeling Convention have signed a declaration of independence,
and elected Mr. Pierpoint Governor of the State, the theory being that
the regularly-elected State officials have forfeited their offices by
their treason to the Federal Government.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Journals belonging to the President's party state that Mr. Lincoln,
in his forthcoming Message to Congress, will recommend the levy of
half a million of men, and the creation of a debt of 250,000,000
dols., of debt for the speedy putting down of the rebellion.</p>

<p>The Government offers to pay for all damages done to private
property by the occupation of land or buildings in Virginia, or by any
willful mischief on the part of the Federal troops.</p>

<p>The Prize Court sitting in Washington has condemned an English
schooner and her cargo, valued at 22,000 dollars, for endeavouring to
run the blockade of the Virginia waters, subject, however, to further
advisement as to an alleged relaxation of the strict law in favour of
British ships then in port.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell, the Times' "special," has arrived at Cairo, Illinois.
He complains that many of his letters never reached their destination,
and that others were tampered with and altered.</p>

<p>The slaver Nightingale arrived at New York on the 18th ult. in
charge of a prize crew, having been captured on the coast of Africa
with 1000 negroes on board.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvanian State loan of 3,000,000 dollars has been all taken
at par by the Philadelphians, and the offers for the Maine loan at par
and up to 4 per cent prem. largely exceeded the amount required.</p>

<p>. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>Up to the last mails from America there is no account of an
engagement of importance; and the journals which, unhappily, adopt,
alternately, a tone of exaggeration and of flippancy, now scoff at the
incessant reports of actions of a "glorious" but perfectly valueless
character.  This in not the way to treat topics of such importance;
and we must say that in this terrible crisis the American press, with
some honourable exceptions, is not proving itself the best friend of
the nation.  It is not easy to select from the mass of rumours which
are daily flung, hot and hot, from the newspaper offices any
substantial information; but it would seem that what advantages have
yet been gained have been won by the Secessionists; while, on the
other hand, General Scott appears to be moving down forces of such
strength that he will be enabled by sheer power of numbers to compel a
Secessionist retreat, unless some act of brilliant strategy by the
South interfere with his plans.  He, a veteran General, is not
intoxicated by the enthusiasm of raw levies, and he continues to
insist upon the necessity of their being converted into soldiers by
steady and continuous drill and discipline.  An Indiana regiment is
said to have fallen into the hands of a strong body of Secessionists.
The latest item of all is that a battle is expected at Fairfax.  If it
be true that the Federal Government has resolved upon the imposition
of an income tax, the Republicans will learn something of the
sacrifices necessitated by a war.  At the same time it would be an
injustice to a generous nation to suppose that supplies will not be as
readily granted as men and arms.  The President's Message is eagerly
looked for, and is stated to be in the hands of the officials.  Report
says that Mr. Lincoln recommends a modification of the Morrill Tariff,
a course which will doubtless be delicately characterised as the
throwing a sop to the English lion.  The sympathy and good faith which
have been shown towards America by this country and its Government
enable us to take petulances with good humour; but it is too much to
ask us to forget, amid all our hatred of slavery as an institution,
that it is only a few months since the Republic-one and
indivisible-would have been indignant at England presuming to sit in
judgment upon the conduct of a single State or Territory.  The
Southerners were our brothers on the last 4th of July, and, if we are
not so quick at forgetting old ties as those who were still more
closely allied to the Secessionists, let this be imputed to the slow
habits of islanders, not to interested motives.</p>

<p rend="center">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</p>
<p rend="right">In Camp, near Washington, June 6.</p>
<p>I REALLY have found it impossible to get my pen under way till now.
Since I have been down here there has been so much ground to be gone
over, such a distance between the subjects sketched, so much
information to be gleaned on all sides, that this is positively the
first opportunity I have had of writing.</p>

<p>My present head-quarters are in the camp of the 2nd New York
Regiment (of which an Engraving was given in our last Number), and I
should not be badly located were it not for the mosquitos and an
occasional night alarm, both of which disturb one's rest considerably.
The former inconvenience goes buzzing about the tent from night to
morn, singing round the restless dreamer's ears like the whirr of a
rifle-bullet, and waking him up with a start of agony as each shot
from the enemy takes effect.  The night alarms may possibly become
less frequent as our sentries gain more experience in their duties: at
present the men are green, and every rustle of the wind among the
trees, every sound that breaks the stillness of the night, is taken
for the advance of the Secessionists.  And here, south of Mason and
Dixon's line, on the borders of Virginia, every living thing that
crawls the earth or has wings commences its revels at the approach of
darkness and continues its riotous proceedings till dawn of day.  The
bull-frog and tree-toad hoarsely croak their dirges from swamp and
wood, the whip-poor-will sighs forth his melancholy plaint, the
screech-owl makes night hideous with his unearthly notes, while
myriads of fireflies snap about in every direction like the sparks
from a blacksmith's anvil, illumining the darkness with their tiny
bright lamps.  Apropos of green sentries, some very funny incidents
have occurred lately, showing their ignorance of their duties.  An
officer with whom I am acquainted was returning to his quarters at a
somewhat late hour, and had to pass through the lines of a strange
camp to reach his own.  As a matter of course, he was challenged by
the sentinel, who was a German, and in answer to the "Who comes
there?" replied, as usual, "Friend with the countersign."  Now, the
challenger should have called out "Approach, friend, and give the
countersign," instead of which he, in this instance, yelled at the top
of his voice, "Dat ish no goot! you not pass me mitout you say
Richemonte."  Richmond was the magic word before which all barriers
were to fall,  and our Lager Beer acquaintance took good care that
this knowledge should be widely diffused.  Again, the field officer of
the day, with an escort, was visiting the posts  on an unusually
gloomy night, and was brought to a stand by an Irishman with the
customary "Who comes there?"  To this the Sergeant of the escort
replied, "Grand Rounds with the countersign," and waited for the
summons to advance, instead of which Pat exclaimed in angry tones,
"Botheration to Gran Roons! who the divil is he?  I thought it was the
ralafe."  However, all this will come right in time, and it is but
justice to this young army to say that they are doing their best to
make soldiers of themselves, and in reality are succeeding
admirably.</p>

<p>On the first evening of my arrival at Washington I was honoured
with an invitation to the reception at Mr. Secretary Seward's, the
Minister of State, and on being presented was received most kindly by
him.  I found that the ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS had its place in the
American Cabinet, and my late connection with it had made my name
familiar to many whom I met in the Minister's rooms.  In the course of
a short conversation I had with the Secretary of State I was asked if
I thought of following in Mr. Russell's footsteps-that is, going
South, and I fancied I could perceive a shade of irritation at the
course our great "word-painter" had thought fit to pursue.  I
disclaimed any idea of so doing, and replied that my fortunes, at
least for the present, would be cast with the army of the Union, and
that I should study to delineate truthfully, with pen and pencil,
without prejudice one way or the other, all that came under my
observation.  I also suggested that had Mr. Russell, like myself, seen
the North as I now saw it he would not have failed in doing justice to
the single-hearted enthusiasm of those States whose best men are given
to uphold the Union and defend the honour of the national flag.  It
should be recollected that when Mr. Russell landed the insult to the
stars and stripes had not been offered at Fort Sumter, and in reality
there was very little outwardly-shown feeling among Northern people.
In opposition to this state of things "Our Special Correspondent"
found in his journey south a population perspiring enthusiasm from
every pore, and strong in their determination to fight to the last man
for what they term their State rights.  It would be difficult, indeed,
to travel among a people so confident of the justice of their cause,
and so sanguine of their ultimate success, without becoming to a
certain extent a convert to their opinions.  Southern hospitality and
southern arguments, washed down with southern claret, may be supposed
to go far to influence "the chiel amongst them taking notes;" but I
very much doubt if Mr. Russell has committed himself in any way.  Of
one thing I am very certain-that he has truthfully and graphically
given his experiences, and, it seems to me, without comment on either
side.  Be this as it may, Mr. Russell's letters have given great
umbrage to the North, and he has personally been attacked by almost
every New York paper, the Herald being most rabid in its remarks, and
even-I am sorry to say it-threats.  The insane ravings of this last
journal against England and Englishmen generally would do more to
create an ill feeling between the two countries than anything I have
seen published on our side of the water; but, fortunately, no
respectable person here pays the slightest attention to its
"editorials," and I do not suppose they ever obtain the honour of
being quoted at home.</p>

<p>In my last I said I would endeavour to say something about the
merits of the fratricidal quarrel dividing the North and the South.
For many years, until the election of Mr. Lincoln as President, the
Central Government of the United States had been in the hands of the
Southern party, or Democrats; and during their long period of office
they reigned supremely over the North.  Tired of this condition of
things, the Republicans, or Northern politicians, determined at last
to make an effort to overthrow the Democrats, and we all know how they
succeeded.  Aware of the storm that was brewing, and foreseeing the
probable wreck of their political bark, the late Government, composed
chiefly of Southern Ministers, prepared for eventualities by acting in
a fashion which smacks very much of treason, considering their oath to
the Constitution.  They transported all kinds of war material South;
they distributed the regular Army to remote points where it could be
of little service to the incoming Administration, and even had an eye
to its being cut off in the event of an uprising of the Southern
States; in fact, their agents were diligently preparing for the
present unfortunate state of affairs.   Even admitting the right of
the South to secede, surely it should have taken some constitutional
mode of separation instead of commencing a civil war by firing the
first shot on Fort Sumter, which the late Government had purposely
left in a defenceless state.  Is it just or generous, after enjoying
the reins of power for years, for a defeated party to excite rebellion
in the heart of a great nation and scatter a people whose emblem of
nationality has floated proudly in every known portion of the world?
What would the English people think if the Palmerston Administration
after a defeat, being obligated to resign, were to create a revolution
in the country simply because their political creed was no longer in
the ascendant?  This appears to me to be what the South has done.</p>

<p>Now, what is the distinction between the Democrat and the
Republican?  The Democrat advocates State rights and the extension of
slavery into certain territories belonging to the United States'
Government-territories that have not yet been admitted to the Union as
States in themselves.  "State rights" would seem to imply, and I
believe it does, an independent power of action in individual States
without reference to the central Government.  Such a system once
admitted would, I assume, develop itself to an extent scarcely
anticipated by those who advocate it; and, instead of a partial
Secession movement, every State would declare itself a separate
sovereignty, and the Union no longer exist.  As for the extension of
slavery, this curse should be diminished, not increased; and such is
the doctrine of the Republican party, who repudiate the idea of its
being taken to those territories where it does not exist, to the
exclusion of white labour and enterprise.  The Republicans desire the
non-extension of this evil, and are advocates of Free-Soil
institutions, so that the tide of emigration flowing into North
America may carry the energy of the white race to the cultivation of
those lands termed territories lately purchased by the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>Such are the points at issue between the North and the South, and
it remains for others more competent than myself to judge between
them.  One thing is, however, certain-the North is determined to
support the constituted Government and preserve the integrity of the
stars and stripes; and to do this she will, if need be, send her
thousands, nay, millions, to the field; and, powerful as she is, her
ultimate success cannot for a moment be doubted.</p>

<p>A few days since, while scouting about for subjects, I found myself
near the advanced posts in the neigbourhood of Fairfax Court House,
Virginia.  The latter place was in the occupation of the Confederate
troops, and orders had been issued for a reconnaissance to be made in
that direction to ascertain their numbers.  A troop of United States'
cavalry was detailed for this purpose, and they made a most gallant
charge through the village, contending against a much superior force,
and killing and wounding between twenty and thirty of the
Confederates, besides bringing off five prisoners.  I sent you a
sketch of this skirmish in my last (engraved in our Number of the 22nd
ult.).  Probably the most harassed and exposed of the Union forces are
the New York Fire Zouaves, a regiment that was recruited by the Late
Colonel Elsworth from the fire companies of the Empire City.  They
have always been in the van since the commencement of hostilities.
They were among the first to cross the Potomac into Virginia, and it
was they who lost their Colonel at the occupation of Alexandria, shot
by a Secessionist while capturing a Secession flag.  Now they are
encamped at the very advance, and there is not a night or day that
passes that their pickets are not engaged with the enemy.  I have made
you drawings of their guard turning out to support outlying companies
(engraved in our Number for June 22), and also of the burial of one of
their men killed in a skirmish close to the camp.  The sentry duty at
the front is exceedingly hazardous, and very few of those who are
posted at night expect to see another day dawn.  The country all round
is thickly covered with wood, and in the darkness the Secessionists,
acquainted with every cowpath, creep softly towards the poor fellow
pacing to and fro on the road, taking advantage of every shadow, and
profiting by the rustle of every falling leaf, until close upon him,
where either the bowie-knife or a rifle shot does the rest.  Before
assistance can reach the unfortunate sentinel the assassin-for this
kind of warfare is nothing better than assassination-has fled through
a track known only to himself, and, mounting his horse, tethered some
two or three hundred yards off, he gallops to Fairfax, to boast of the
valiant deed of which he is the hero.</p>

<p>By the Jura we have received New York journals of the 27th ult.,
and telegrams to the evening of the 29th.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>There have been no movements of any importance since our last.
Mr. Lincoln and General Scott seem to be waiting for the sanction of
Congress, which was to reassemble on the 4th inst., before ordering
any further advance into Virginia.  The report of the cutting to
pieces of the Home Guard at Piedmont, and the surrounding of an
Indiana regiment at Cumberland, Maryland, by Confederates under the
command of General Johnston, was entirely without foundation.  The
Governor of Missouri, when last heard of, was marching southward, with
a view of securing the lead-mines in the south-west corner of the
State.  It was reported that Arkansas troops were on their way to aid
the State Government of Missouri against the Federal Government.  The
blockading fleet have captured the British ship Amelia, bound to
Charleston, and laden with stores said to be contraband of war-which
were iron crates, camp-ovens, equipage, and machinery.  She has been
taken to New York.  Another British ship, the Forfarshire, has been
captured in the Gulf of Mexico,-reason not stated.</p>

<p>Professor Lowe has been taking observations of the Confederate
positions near Washington in his balloon, and communicating the
results by means of an electric-telegraph apparatus which he takes up
with him, the wire of which connects with friends below.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Connection between these States and the civilised world continues
to be maintained by the telegraph and railway lines which run through
Kentucky, and by private letter-delivery companies, which have their
head-quarters in Louisville, the chief city of this neutral State.</p>

<p>The Southerners, in addition to their other wants, stand in need of
lucifer-matches and quinine.  In many places they are obliged to have
recourse to the old-fashioned tinder-box.  The demand for quinine
suggests the idea of fever and ague, so endemic in the Southern and
Western States.  A Philadelphia house refused lately to supply even a
Kentucky purchaser with this valuable drug.</p>

<p>The people of Eastern Tennessee refuse to send representatives to
the Legislature of Tennessee.  Senator Andrew Johnson, who resides in
this region, has been to Washington, and, it is said, obtained the
promise of Mr. Lincoln that his people shall receive assistance from
the Federal authorities.</p>

<p>The Federal Government have recognised the provisional Government of Western Virginia as the only lawful executive-the theory being that the regularly-appointed State Government has forfeited its rights by committing acts of treason against the United States.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NEUTRAL STATES.</p>

<p>General Banks has arrested Marshal Kane, the chief of the Baltimore
police, on a charge of treason, and has appointed a provost-marshal
for the city.  Marshal Kane has been sent to Fort M'Henry.  The
Baltimoreans sympathise strongly with him.</p>

<p>With Kentucky a sort of concordat has been made.  She is to execute
all United States' laws as expounded by the Federal judicature.  The
Federal troops will not invade her soil provided she does not allow it
to be occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>Thirty-four companies had volunteered their services to the Federal
Government from Kentucky.  The election returns from this State
indicate that nearly all the Union candidates for Congress have been
elected.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>According to a statement furnished by the Secretary of War to
President Lincoln for the message to Congress, about 225,000
volunteers are now mustered in the United States' service.</p>

<p>General Dembinski, the celebrated Pole, has offered his services to
the Federal Government.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>A mob has attacked the banks in Milwaukie [sic], Wisconsin.  The
military were ordered out, and arrested thirty of the rioters.  A
strict guard is kept over the gaol to prevent a rescue.  The reason
for the attack was the throwing out of the notes of several of the
State banks.</p>

<p>The French declaration of neutrality has been well received by the
New York press.  They profess to be able to see an important
difference between it and that of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The New York Times of the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>
ult. directs public attention to the approaching International
Exhibition of 1862.  It says in referenre [sic] to the speedy
appointment of a commission, "We know that a large number of our best
mechanicians are anxious to exhibit, and we would inquire, on their
behalf, if our Government has taken any steps in the matter.  One
day's time, expended by the proper bureau, could well be spared from
war matters, and would be ample to settle this whole business.  We
earnestly recommend this extremely important subject to the attention
of the Government: it is a subject not of temporary, but of permanent,
importance to the people."</p>

<p>The crew of the captured privateer Savannah has been thus analysed
by a New York evening paper:-the captain is a Philadelphian by birth;
the first officer and purser are South Carolinians; the sailing master
a North Carolinian.  Of the deck hands three are Irish, two are
Scotch, one each from New York and Massachusetts, and one from
Germany.  The steward is a native of Manilla, and the cook of
China.</p>

<p>Only one-third of the six per cent State loan of Indiana was taken
at satisfactory prices in New York.  The lowest offer accepted was at
15 per cent discount.</p>

<p>Northern public opinion is impatient of the Fabian tactics of
General Scott, denounces the Kentucky concordat, and suspects
treachery in the non-recall of Mr. Harvey, the newly-appointed
Minister to Portugal, and the ex-correspondent of the Charleston
Mercury.</p>

<p>The New York police have seized at a merchant's office a petition, with numerous signatures, praying the Federal Administration to suspend hostilities.
A movement is on foot in the southern portion of California to join

<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">HARGES</hi> of brutality, and even of
assassination, are rife in the Unionist camp against the
Secessionists, who, doubtless, have countercharges with which they
also could horrify us, had they, like their rivals, the ear of Europe;
for all camps are sure to be infested with desperadoes who, under the
garb of patriotism, prowl about to gratify their own evil purposes.
The sentry duty at the front of the Unionist camp is, we are told,
exceedingly hazardous, and very few of those who are posed at night
expect to see another day dawn.  The country all round is thickly
covered with wood, and in the darkness the Secessionists, acquainted
with every cowpath, creep softly towards the poor fellow pacing to and
fro on the road, taking advantage of every shadow, and profiting by
the rustle of every falling leaf, until close upon him, where either
the bowie-knife or a rifle-shot does the rest.</p>

<p>One night our Special Artist accompanied the scouting party, of
which the annexed is an Illustration, twelve miles into the enemy's
country.  The men were dressed in round slouched hats, rough flannel
blouses, and carried revolvers and bowie-knives in their belts. Two in
advance carried guns, ready cocked, keeping a sharp look out for
ambuscades on each side among the trees.  The Lieutenant in command
and our artist were in the centre.</p>

<p>Still no news of a conflict in America, but, on the contrary, news
of propositions of peace by the South, or, at all events, of a
willingness on the part of the seceders to come to terms.  The
information chiefly comes to us through channels unfriendly to the
South, but accompanied by much bluster as to the certainty of the
proposals being indignantly rejected, and we must take the whole
announcement cum grano.  The Southerns are stated to desire to be
recognised as a State; and, if this be conceded, they are willing to
enter into commercial arrangements highly favourable to the North.
Divers of the Northern organs affect to believe that General Scott is
pursuing a Fabian policy, in order to weary out the war party, and to
permit the American mind to be familiarised with the propositions of
the South.  On the other hand, it is said that ardent members of the
Federal Government are highly displeased at his inaction, and are
perpetually calling on him to strike a blow.  There is no necessity
for crediting the veteran General with so much subtlety.  His apparent
inaction is quite comprehensible.  The gallant and disciplined regular
army at his command is small; and, though it would no doubt accomplish
brave things, as heretofore in Mexico, when it saved the honour of the
Republic, it would be madness to attempt war on a large scale until
force adequate to the occasion could be brought into play.  As soon as
General Scott has turned his volunteers into soldiers he will,
doubtless, be ready enough to fight, unless, happily, the delay shall
have rendered much fighting needless.  Sincerely do we hope to have
many an occasion for recording that we have "no important news" from
the West.</p>

<p>France has taken a step on the question of slavery which has excited
much interest.  The Emperor has formally abolished the present system
of obtaining negro labour by means of those contracts entered into
along the coasts, and which in practice, if not in theory, are just as
much slave sales as any other transaction which has ever supplied
black labour to France.  The ordinance itself will be good, and the
implied protest against slavery has perhaps a still higher value.
England is honourably associated with France in this document, and it
is gratifying to the philanthropist to note such association, for
every protest against the unholy system of slavery is a blow that
hastens its downfal [sic].</p>

the Secessionists retire to the woods.  One of the Garibaldi Guard
received a bullet wound in his leg.  This corps is made up of Germans,

<p>President Lincoln having, in his Message to Congress, called for
400,000 men to enable him to restore the seceded States to the Union,
Mr. Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio, the Secretary of the Treasury (an
official whose functions correspond with those of the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer), presented to Congress on the 5th
inst. an interesting written report, or budget, the substance of which
we proceed to give.  We premise that the fiscal year of the United
States commences on July 1 of each year.  The total estimates for the
current fiscal year (July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1862) are 318,519,582
dols. (omitting fractions of a dollar), or about £65,000,000.  To meet
this expenditure Mr. Chase thinks it advisable to raise 320,000,000
dols.  "With great deference and no little distrust of his own
judgment," he recommends that 80,000,000 dols. should be raised by
taxation, and that 240,000,000 dols. should be sought through loans.
The question, then, is how to raise this 80,000,000 dols.  His choice
is limited to duties on imports, direct taxes, and excise duties.  The
principal advantages of the system of direct taxes are found in the
sensibility with which they are felt and observed in the motives thus
arising for economy and fidelity in the administration and in the
manifest equity of distributing burdens in proportion to means rather
than in proportion to consumption.  On the other hand, the advantages
of indirect taxation by duties on imports are found in the economy of
collection, in the facility of payment, in the adaptability to the
encouragement of industry, and, above all, in the avoidance of Federal
interference with the finances of the States, whose main reliance for
revenue for all objects of State administration must necessarily be
upon levies on property.  These considerations have doubtless
determined the preference which has always been evinced by the people
of the United States for duties on imports as the chief source of
national revenue.  Only on occasions of special exigency has a resort
been had to direct taxation or to internal duties or excise.</p>

<p>But the present "Morrill" tariff will not produce anything like the
80,000,000 dols. required.  During the first quarter of the last
fiscal year the receipts on imports were only 5,527,000 dols.  The
sources of revenue most promptly to be made available must be sought
in the articles now exempt from duty or but lightly taxed.  These
articles have heretofore been taxed, and were only exempted when the
debts contracted in former wars had been fully paid.  Of the articles
now lightly taxed, sugar, and of those wholly free, tea and coffee,
are the most important.  The Secretary proposes that a duty of 2 1/2
cents per pound be laid on brown sugar, 3 cents on clayed sugar, and 4
cents on loaf and refined sugars; corresponding duties on syrup,
candy, and molasses; on coffee, 5 cents per pound; on black tea, 15
cents per pound; and on green tea, 20 cents (10d.).  These duties will
produce an additional revenue of 20,000,000 dols.  By other minor
reforms of the tariff he hopes to raise 7,000,000 dols. more, and that
the whole customs revenue for the year will reach 57,000,000 dols.
The sale of public lands and miscellaneous sources will be good for
3,000,000 dols.-making the total 60,000,000 dols.  He still wants
20,000,000 dols. more from taxes.  He must resort for this either to
direct taxes or to excises.  The Constitution requires that the former
be apportioned among the States, in the ratio of the Federal
population; the latter need only be uniform through the United States.
The Secretary is willing to be guided by Congress as to which source
of taxation he shall tap.  The value of the real and personal property
of the people of the United States, according to the Census of 1860,
is, omitting fractions, sixteen thousand million of dols.  The value
of real property is estimated at 11,272,000,000 dols., and of personal
at 4,831,000,000 dols.  The proportion of property of both
descriptions in the loyal States is-of real, 7,630,000,000, and of
personal, 3,270,000,000.  A rate of one fifth of one per cent on the
real and personal property of the loyal States would produce
21,800,000 dols., and a rate of three tenths of one per cent on the
real property alone in these States would produce 23,892,000 dolls.,
either sum being largely in excess of that required.  The difficulty
in the way of a direct tax is that in many of the States no State
valuations and no State machinery for collecting direct taxes on
property exist.  In these States it would be necessary to create an
extensive and complicated Federal machinery.  The constitutional
objection arising from the non-incidence of the tax on the
insurrectionary States amounts to nothing.  The tax will be levied in
all States alike, and the difficulty of collection cannot vitiate the
legality of the tax itself.</p>

<p>Excise duties have this to recommend them-they may be collected
more cheaply than direct taxes, by fewer agents, and with less
interference with the finances of the States.  They may also be made
to bear hard upon the luxurious classes.  If Congress should prefer
excise duties to direct taxes, or should like to combine the two
systems, the Secretary recommends duties on stills and distilled
liquors, on ale and beer, on tobacco, on bank notes, on spring
carriages, on silver ware and jewellery, and on legacies.</p>

<p>One other source Mr. Chase indicates with delight.  The property of
"rebels" and "traitors" can be confiscated to the public treasury.</p>

<p>Congress may also retrench.  Let 10 per cent be deducted from all
salaries paid by the Federal Government, and let the members abolish
the franking privilege and reduce the postal expenses.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to the 240,000,000 dols. which is to be raised by loan.
The National Debt amounted on the 1st inst. to 90,867, 828 dols.  The
Secretary finds that the capitalists of the country will advance no
more on terms which are satisfactory to him.  As the war is a people's
war he will appeal direct to the people.  He proposes to open a
national loan for 100,000,000 dollars, and for any amount beyond that,
to be issued in the form of Treasury notes or Exchequer bills, bearing
a yearly interest of 7 3-10ths per cent, to be paid half-yearly, and
redeemable after three years from date.  The interest will be equal to
a cent a day on fifty dollars, and the loan will be issued in sums of
50 dols., and any multiple thereof.  The amount of interest for
specified periods will be endorsed on the back of each note.  If
anybody thinks the rate of interest too high, the Secretary can only
say that the capitalists will not take his six per cent bonds at any
figure which would make them more advantageous to the Treasury than
the proposed national loan.  Subscription offices are to be opened
everywhere, and payment will be received in installments as low as ten
dollars.  But in case the National loan hangs fire, or does not
produce enough, the Secretary has another arrow in his quiver.  He
will ask power to issue bonds, or certificates of debt, in dollars or
pounds sterling.  These bonds are to be redeemable after the
expiration of thirty years, and bear interest at seven per cent,
payable in London, or at the United States' Treasury.  The Secretary
is pretty confident that his own countrymen are too shrewd and too
patriotic to allow many of these seven per cent bonds to go abroad,
but if they should let a few slip through their fingers they will
assuredly be eagerly snapped up in London.  As an auxiliary measure,
the Secretary returns to 10-dollar Treasury notes, payable one year
from date, and bearing interest; and in all these ways he hopes to
raise his 240,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>Having canvassed the different ways and means of raising
320,000,000 dols., the Secretary concludes by referring to the
difficulty of collecting the revenue in the ports of the so-called
Confederate States, and to the impediments to commerce raised by the
Confederate tariff.  He recommends that Congress pass a law for
closing the said ports or providing for such collection on ship-board.
Legislation is also required to enable the President to lay an inland
embargo on goods going to the insurgent districts, and to remit the
same at pleasure.  For the furtherance of all these mixed financial
and political purposes he respectfully submits a series of draught
bills to the consideration of Congress.  The energies of a great
people will, as he firmly believes, surmount all the troubles and
calamities of the present time, and, under the good hand of the God of
our fathers, out of these very troubles and difficulties build a
future which shall surpass the whole glorious past in the richness of
its blessings and benefits.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> President's Message is of a warlike
character.  Mr. Lincoln asks for 400,000 men and 400,000,000 dollars,
and his Finance Minister proposes to raise what is required by heavy
direct, and light indirect, taxation, and by a loan.  It is also
stated that a body of Secessionists had received a repulse, and that a
great battle was imminent, unless the Southerners should retreat.  It
would seem, therefore, that our brethren over the sea were about to
learn from experience the real meaning of the terrible word "war," so
flippantly bandied about by those who have hitherto known nothing of
that stern reality.  At this eleventh hour, and before any news can
arrive to operate upon the mind of Europe, let us have the melancholy
satisfaction of once more recording that England has all along
regarded this fratricidal contest with an aversion caused by nobler
motives than those which have been so ungenerously attributed to her;
that it is with grief-ay, and with something like shame-that she
beholds men who speak her own language and emulate her own
civilisation, rushing in arms upon one another; and that her earnest
anxiety is to see peace restored.  She can afford to be told that she
has interested views, she can bear to have her suggestions and her
mediation ungraciously received, but she will not the less strenuously
enter her protest against the stupidest and the wickedest way of
attempting to adjust domestic differences.  England hates slavery, and
ever will hate it; but she has no desire to behold its American
antagonists gain such a success as will leave a burning rancour in the
hearts of its advocates.</p>

with the Virginia shore, is a mile long, and about a quarter of a mile
of the centre part is built of masonry, with low parapets, and
resembles a country road.  The remainder of the bridge is of wood.  It
is sufficiently wide to take three carriages abreast, and has two
draws-one on the Washington and one on the Virginia side.  These are
nearly always open for the passage of small armed propellers, with
which the Potomac swarms.  A company of flying artillery is stationed
on the bridge every night near the Virginia shore, with the draw
raised in front of them.  By day the passage across the bridge is
unobstructed, and waggons are constantly passing and repassing,
although, for form's sake, a company of soldiers is stationed at the

<p>E<hi rend="smallcaps">UROPE</hi> is suffering from an
overproduction of Presidents' Messages.  Instead of the ordinary rate
of one a year, the last seven months have brought us three Messages
and one Inaugural Address, all on the same theme, and each one
differing materially in its conclusions from all the rest.  First,
there was Mr. Buchanan's Message, declaring against the constitutional
right of secession, but favouring the right of revolution, and
elaborately proving that the Constitution gave no power to either
President or Congress to "coerce" a State.  Secondly, there was
Mr. Lincoln's Inaugural, denying both the constitutional and
revolutionary right of secession, affirming the right of using force
to regain possession of the forts and arsenals, but disclaiming any
intention of subjugating a State or transcending by a hair's breadth
those limits which the Constitution imposed on the executive branch of
Government.  Third in order came Mr. Jefferson Davis's Message to his
Congress, repudiating the idea that there was any revolution (much
less rebellion) at all.  According to him, Secession was a reserved
right, and its exercise had been as legal and constitutional as any
normal operation of Government.  Latest of all, we have Mr. Lincoln's
second manifesto, in which he admits having ventured upon measures
which, "whether legal or not, were ventured upon under what appeared
to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting then, as now,
that Congress would readily ratify them."  There is no longer any
squeamishness about not invading or subjugating a State, and there is
an entirely new view of the relations between the States and the
Union-namely, that the latter created the former, and not the former
the latter, as was the universal previous opinion.  Nor is this all.
On the 20th inst. the Confederate Congress met at Richmond, unless,
indeed, the sanguine anticipations of the Northerners have been
realised and Richmond was then in their hands.  The reassembling of
this Congress will have extracted another Message from Mr. Davis, who
will hardly fail to improve the opportunity to demolish in the eyes of
the world the novel constitutional theory of Mr. Lincoln.  In the
complicated and interminable suit of "Jarndyce v. Jarndyce" none of
the advocates retained could speak for five minutes on the case
without being irreconcilably at issue with every other advocate on
every point of fact and law.  It is the same in the complicated and
costly suit of South v. North, only that in this there seems to be
superadded an inability in any leading counsel to be consistent even
with himself.</p>

<p>However much they may differ in their premises and conclusions, all these constitutional argumentations have a wonder-

ful family likeness to each other.  They are all evidently the
offspring of the legal mind.  They are all plentifully charged with
splenetic humours against the representatives of the other side.
Their utterers seem willing to go over the same ground again and
again, but the court of public opinion to which they appeal is fast
settling down to the conviction that this part of the case has been
dwelt on long enough.  The allusion of the President to the foreign
relations of the country will be reassuring to the soberer portion of
the Americans of the North, and is couched in terms not offensive to
the nations most nearly connected with the United States.  The inkling
he gives of his future policy towards the "rebels" is hardly definite
enough to satisfy anybody.  As it is, perhaps, the most important
passage in his Message, we quote it entire:-</p>

<p><quote rend="blockquote">Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as to what
is to be the course of the Government toward the Southern States after
the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive deems it
proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be guided by
the Constitution and the laws, and that he probably will have no
different understanding of the powers and duties of the Federal
Government relatively to the rights of the States and the people under
the Constitution than that expressed in the Inaugural Address.</quote></p>

<p>That "probably" will appear ominous to the Southerners and their
sympathisers in the neutral and Northern States.  It looks as if
Mr. Lincoln felt that another "popular demand and public necessity"
might arise which would compel him to act differently towards the
defeated rebels than his unbiassed judgment would prompt, and he has
lately received a lesson on the inexpediency of making unqualified
pledges which the storm of popular passion and the march of events
render him unable to abide by.  Quite as significant as anything he
says is his utter silence about slavery.  The word does not occur from
beginning to end.  This silence harmonises with other symptoms of
Northern public opinion, from which we gather that the war is not to
have any anti-slavery tendency.  The Republicans have made a tacit
compromise with the Democrats.  The latter will continue to support
the war, provided it remain strictly one for the Union, for the flag,
for territory, for empire; and, as a price of this indispensable
support, the Republicans consent not to give an anti-slavery character
to their policy.  The disappointed parties will be those Abolitionists
proper who gave countenance to the war, not because they desired to
restore a Union with slaveowners, which they had always denounced, but
because they indulged the hope that the war must inevitably terminate
in the liberation of the enslaved race.</p>

<p>The departmental reports which accompany the President's Message
are more than usually interesting.  The Secretary of War states there
are 235,000 men now in the field.  The proud exultation with which he
makes the following confession is no more than what is warranted by
the facts of the last three months:-</p>

<p><quote rend="blockquote">At the present moment the Government presents the striking anomaly
of being embarrassed by the generous outpouring of volunteers to
sustain its action.  Instead of labouring under the difficulty of
monarchical Governments, the want of men to fill its armies (which in
other countries has compelled a resort to forced conscriptions), one
of its main difficulties is to keep down the proportions of the army
and to prevent it from swelling beyond the actual force required.</quote></p>

<p>There is manifestly not only no lack, but a superabundance, of men.
But what as to money?  For this we must consult the lucid report of
the Secretary of Treasury.  He wants for the current fiscal year
320,000,000 dollars.  Of this he proposes to raise by taxation only
one-fourth; the other three-fourths are to be supplied by loans.  This
would be deemed an improvident way of beginning a war in Europe; but,
considering that the National Debt of the United States is only
90,000,000 dollars, the Northerners are, perhaps, entitled to more
latitude in the way of borrowing than could decently be claimed by any
more prodigal nation whose ancestors had long since sown all the wild
oats there were to sow.  The Secretary of War boasts of his surplus of
men; but the Financial Secretary does not proclaim any plethora of
cash.  On the contrary, the multitude of shapes which he gives to his
loan proposals, the desire to make them popular, the high rate of
interest offered-amounting in the case of the "national loan" to seven
and three-tenths per cent-show that he is far from confident of the
strength of his position.  Scrutinising the report more closely, we
discover a confession that the capitalists have failed him.  United
States' Six per Cents are now selling at fifteen per cent discount,
and the Secretary owns that he has been unable to get any bids for a
new loan at par, and only a very small quantity at rates varying from
eighty-five to ninety.  "It needs no further argument to work the
conviction that, under the exiting laws, little or nothing of the
required sum can be realised."  The moneyed men having failed him, he
appeals to those of smal [sic] means.  He announces a national loan,
on the French pattern, in Exchequer bills of the low figure of fifty
dollars.  He also hopes to draw upon the resources of British
capitalists by offering to issue bonds in sterling money to bear seven
per cent interest, payable in London.  It must have gone hard with a
patriotic Secretary before he could bring himself to make such a
proposal; but it is another indication of the low estimate he places
on the patriotism of the men who, with a larger amount of money in
their banks wanting investment than was ever known before, demanded on
a recent occasion twelve and even seventeen per cent from their
Government at a moment of danger, and when it was at their mercy.</p>

<p>The present war is a people's war, and must be supported, if at
all, by the people's money.  Will it be so supported?  This is the
great question of the day.  Will the popular loan be as successful in
the United States as in France?  This remains to be seen.  But if it
shall prove a failure the exhibition of northern patriotism will have
been partial and incomplete.  Severe critics will say myriads were
eager to fight, but few were willing to pay.  They will account for
the multitude of recruits by pointing to the state of the American
labour market.  A very busy population suddenly found its ordinary
employments stopped by a political crisis.  That crisis, instead of
coming to an end, only became more severe and widely extended.  The
working classes became moody, and began to suffer.  Suddenly the
Government called the unwillingly idle and suffering people to arms.
What wonder they rushed to the recruiting d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts?  What other resource
had they left?  This is the construction cynical critics will put upon
the popular uprising if the national loan fails; and even candid and
friendly minds will be unable to distinguish to how great an extent
the genuine patriotism which raised an army of 300,000 volunteers in
three months was alloyed by less chivalric impulses.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna at Queenstown, and the Nova Scotian at
Londonderry, we have received news to the 13th inst.</p>


<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The Confederate ship-of-war Sumter ran the blockade off the port of
Charleston, and escaped to sea.  The privateer Jefferson Davis has
captured five Northern vessels  off Cape Halteras [sic], and sent them
into unblockaded Southern ports.  Six revenue-cutters have been
dispatched from New York and Boston in pursuit of these marauders.</p>

<p>On land the fighting has been confined to General M'Lellan's
division in Western Virginia, and General Lyon's in Missouri.  The
former division attacked the intrenched camp of the Confederates,
numbering 2000 men, at Rich Mountain, near Beverley.  The Confederates
were routed, and all their guns, camp equipage, and waggons were
captured.  Sixty Confederates and twenty Unionists were killed in the
encounter.</p>

<p>In Missouri a battle occurred at Carthage on the 5th inst.  1200
Federalists attacked 4000 State troops, and retired with a loss of
eight men and forty-five wounded.</p>

<p>On the 12th Colonel Smith routed another body of State troops at
Monroe, Missouri.</p>

<p> General Patterson is still at Martinsburg, where he has received
large reinforcements.  General Johnson, at the head of 16,000
Confederates, is stationed at Bunker's Hill, a place seven miles south
of Martinsburg.</p>

<p rend="center">CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>No one is allowed to leave Richmond in any direction without a passport.
Colonel Taylor, who had been sent with despatches from Mr. Davis to
Mr. Lincoln under the protection of a flag of truce, was sent back
without an answer, his communication being of too frivolous a nature.
It is supposed that it related to an exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Congress reassembled on the 4th inst.  Senator Johnson, of
Tennessee[,] and five representatives from Western Virginia, were the
only members present from any portion of the seceding States.  The
President's Message was received on the 5th.  We give this important
State paper in full in the Supplement at page 96.</p>

<p>Both Houses of Congress are busy at work legalising everything the
President did during the recess, and voting men and money in excess
even of what the Cabinet demanded.  In pursuance of this policy
Congress has determined to consider nothing at this Session but the
naval and military appropriations, and the financial measures
connected therewith.</p>

<p>A resolution passed the House of Representatives calling on the
President for the correspondence which had taken place in consequence
of the "insolent and aggressive" conduct of Spain in the invasion of
San Domingo.  The President replied that it was not advisable to
produce the correspondence at present.</p>

<p>On the motion of Mr. Lovejoy, of Illinois, a man of Radical
Anti-Slavery opinions, the House passed, by a vote of 92 against 55,
the following resolutions:-1 .  "That in the judgment of this House it
is no part of the duty of the soldiers of the United States to capture
or return fugitives slaves."  2.  "That the Committee on the Judiciary
be instituted to inquire into the expediency of repealing the law
called the 'Fugitive Slave Law.'"</p>

<p rend="center">NEUTRAL STATES.</p>

<p>A State Convention of the people of Delaware, held at Dover, to
consider the position of that State towards the contending Powers,
passed resolutions favouring a recognition of the independence of the
Confederate States as preferable to the continuance of civil war, and
expressing a fear lest the doctrines and measures of the war party
should lead to the subversion of the State Governments, and the
erection of a consolidated Government on the ruins of the Federal
Constitution.</p>

<p>The Baltimoreans are awed into quiet by the military occupation of
their city by General Banks's division.</p>

<p>In St. Louis the printing mat&eacute;riel of a States-rights' journal has
been seized by General Lyon, the Federal commander.</p>

<p rend="center">NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>The New York merchants have held a meeting to petition Congress to
pass a bankrupt law.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Legislature has refused to ratify a constitutional
amendment, passed by a previous Legislature, which conferred the right
of suffrage on coloured citizens.  The amendment is consequently
lost.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">EFORE</hi> the introduction of railways
facility of communication, upon which the prosperity of America
depended, rendered the perfection of lake and river steamers a matter
of such vital importance that all the natural mechanical ingenuity
peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race became taxed to the utmost to
construct the most perfect class of steam-vessels adapted to the
peculiar traffic of the locality they were to be employed in.  High
speed, sleeping and feeding accommodation for the passengers, and
shallow draught of water-requisites common to nearly all American
vessels-have given the present form and character to the steamers used
throughout the United States and the British provinces.</p>

<p>An examination of the construction of these vessels, and the
innumerable details and contrivances necessary in them, give one a
very high idea of the mechanical skill and inventive powers of the
American people: from the colossal beam-engine which propels her down
to the minutest fittings-up of the bed-cabins, the barber's shop, or
the lavatories, everything that ingenuity can devise for making things
perfect has been done.  We cannot say that we have observed the same
attention to those details upon which the comforts of the passengers
so much depend on board English ships.  It arises from this cause-that
in America the building and fitting of the cabins is done by a class
of people who devote themselves entirely to such work and study to
attain perfection at it.  In England the shipbuilder who designs the
ship applies his whole ability to perfecting the hull, rigging, and
fittings of the deck, and doubtless builds a vessel better adapted to
bear the rude handling of stormy, winter seas than is produced in any
other part of the world; but cabin comforts he despises, and thinks
lubbers only require them, so leaves it pretty much to ship-joiners
and inferior people, who do them all after one plan, whether the
vessel be intended to navigate the Baltic in winter or the Red Sea and
Indian Ocean in winter.</p>

<p>There is also another reason why a difference should exist in the
general characteristics of American and English steamers.  The latter
[sic] vessels are nearly always running long passages on an even keel
and in comparatively smooth water, their rivers, lakes, and great
sounds and estuaries being of that character; while in England we have
scarcely any long journeys to make by water unless we cross either of
the Channels or the North Sea, in which case the vessel, though she
start from London-bridge, must be in every respect such a sufficient
sea-boat that she could cross the great Atlantic itself, for none can
tell but that, in her little voyage to Boulogne, Calais, Rotterdam, or
Hull, she may have to encounter weather as bad as, if not worse than,
any she might fall in with in a passage to New York.</p>

<p>Steam navigation in America commenced upon the Hudson.  It is about
fifty years since that Fulton placed his first steamer, the Clerimont
[sic], upon that river; and only one little steam-vessel was then
running in England-that was the Charlotte Dundas-Symington's boat-upon
the Forth of Clyde Canal.  Now all the seas, rivers, and great lakes
in the world are navigated by steamers.  In the important point of
speed the Hudson River boats have always maintained the lead.  The
fastest steam-vessel in the world is now running there, the Daniel
Drew.  This vessel has attained the extraordinary speed of twenty-five
miles an hour without assistance from either wind or tide.</p>

<p>Our Illustration of American river-steamers, the New World, is
chosen as showing in the fullest manner the peculiarities of this
class of craft, the immense stack of sleeping-cabins, the projecting
sponsons, or guards, the remarkable manner in which the rigidity of
the hull is maintained by trussing with wooden beams, braces, iron
tie-rods, &c., without which the vibration of the mass would be
terrific, while with it the whole is so steady that a passenger cannot
feel in the slightest degree either the beat of the engine or the
revolution of the paddles.</p>

<p>The boilers of this vessel are placed outside on the guards, a
singular position for such great weights, but tending much to keep the
vessel cool, as well as adding to her safety.  This class of vessel,
with more or less of top hamper in the way of cabins, is used on all
the waters of the northern and eastern States.  They navigate, also,
Long Island Sound and the Bay of Fundy; but they must not be
confounded with the class of high-pressure boats that navigate the
rivers of the southern and western States.  It is these latter that
have earned such notoriety for exploding and getting in collision,
although some terrible accidents have happened in the northern States
and on the lakes, the most recent on Lake Michigan.  The Lady Elgin
was a vessel of precisely the class we have been describing.</p>

<p>Between Boston and New York are lines of magnificent steamers.
They run in connection with the railway at Allan Point, their course
being about 146 miles by the East River and Long Island Sound.  This
distance they generally accomplish in about seven hours and a half,
including the delay in calling at New London to discharge and take in
both passengers and cargo.  They regularly maintain this high speed;
and it is a fine sight to witness the departure of quite a fleet of
these vessels every evening from their docks at New York.</p>

Special Artist has forwarded to us a characteristic sketch (herewith
engraved) of a party of slaves seeking protection in the Federal camp.
It appears that the slaves from the different plantations in Virginia
are continually going through the pickets of the Federal army, as
fugitives from their masters, and when it is proved that their owners
are fighting in the Secessionist ranks the slaves are treated as
contraband of war.</p>

<p>The incident depicted on the first page-the Capture of a United

Messrs. Johnson, of Tennessee; and Breckinridge, of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives was organised immediately on assembling by the election of the Hon. G. A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, for Speaker.  Mr. Grow, on taking the chair, made a strong Union address to the Congress.</p>
<p>The following is the President's Message:-</p>

<quote>
<p rend="center">FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>

<p>Having been convened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorised by
the Constitution, your attention is not called to any ordinary subject
of legislation.  At the beginning of the present presidential term,
four months ago, the functions of the Federal Government were found to
be generally suspended within the several States of South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only
those of the Post Office Department.  Within these States all the
forts, arsenals, dockyards, custom-houses, and the like, including the
moveable and stationary property in and about them, had been seized,
and were held in open hostility to this Government, excepting only
Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on and near the Florida coast,
and Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbour, South Carolina.  The forts
thus seized had been put in improved condition, new ones had been
built, and armed forces had been organised, and were organising, all
avowedly with the same hostile purpose.  The forts remaining in the
possession of the Federal Government in and near these States were
either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations, and especially
Fort Sumter, which was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile
batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and
outnumbering the latter, perhaps, ten to one.  A disproportionate
share of the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow found their way
into these States, and had been seized, to be used against the
Government.  Accumulations of the public revenue lying within them had
been seized for the same object; the navy was scattered in distant
seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate reach
of the Government.  Officers of the Federal army had resigned in great
numbers, and of those resigning a large number had taken up arms
against the Government.  Simultaneously, and in common with all this,
the purpose to sever the Federal Union was openly avowed.  In
accordance with this purpose an ordinance had been adopted in each of
these States  declaring the States respectively to be separated from
the National Union.  A formula for instituting a combined government
of those States had been promulgated, and this illegal organisation,
in the character of the "Confederate States," was already invoking
recognition, aid, and intervention from foreign Powers.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FORBEARANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an
imperative duty upon the incoming Executive to prevent if possible the
consummation of such an attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice
of means to that end became indispensable.  This choice was made, and
was declared in the Inaugural Address.  The policy chosen looked to
the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any
stronger ones; it sought only to hold the public places and property
not already wrested from the Government, and to collect the revenue,
relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box.  It
promised a continuance of the mails, at Government expense, to the
very people who were resisting the Government, and it gave repeated
pledges against any disturbances to any of the people or any of their
rights.  Of all that which a President might constitutionally and
justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which
it was believed possible to keep the Government on foot.</p>

<p>On March 5, the present incumbent's first full day in office, a
letter from Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on
Feb. 28, and received at the War Department on March 4, was by that
department placed in his hand.  The letter expressed the professional
opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into
that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the
limited supply of provisions, and with the view of holding possession
of the same with a force of less than 20,000 good and well-disciplined
men.  This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his
command, and their memoranda on the subject were made the inclosures
of Major Anderson's letter.  The whole was immediately laid before
Lieutenant-General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in
his opinion.  On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting
with other officers, both of the Army and the Navy, and at the end of
four days came reluctantly, but decidedly, to the same conclusion as
before.  He also stated, at the same time, that no such sufficient
force was then at the control of the Government, or could be raised or
brought to the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort
would be exhausted.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FORT SUMTER AFFAIR.</p>

<p>In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the
Administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison
safely out of the fort.  It was believed, however, that to so abandon
that position, under the circumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that
the necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully
understood; that by many it would be construed as part of a voluntary
policy; that at home it would discourage the friends of the Union,
embolden its adversaries, and go far to ensure to the latter a
recognition abroad-that, in fact, it would be our national destruction
consummated.  This could not be allowed.  Starvation was not yet upon
the garrison, and, ere it would be reached, Fort Pickens might be
reinforced.  This last would be a clear indication of policy, and
would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of Fort
Sumter.  As a military necessity, an order was at once directed to be
sent for the landing of troops from the steam-ship Brooklyn into Fort
Pickens.  This order could not go by land, but must take the longer
and slower route by sea.  The first return news from the order was
received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter.  The news
itself was that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the
troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some
quasi-armistice of the late Administration, and of the existence of
which the present Administration, up to the time the order was
dispatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention,
had refused to land the troops to reinforce Fort Pickens, before a
crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible, rendered so by
the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named fort.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EXPEDITION FOR ITS RELIEF.</p>

<p>In precaution against such a conjuncture the Government had, a few
days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as
might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be
ultimately used or not, according to circumstances,  The strongest
anticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved
to send it forward as had been intended.  In this contingency it was
also resolved to notify to the Governor of South Carolina that he
might expect that an attempt would be made to provision the fort, and,
if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be an attempt to
throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case
of an attack upon the fort.  This notice was accordingly given,
whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without
even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE THE UNION.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter
was in no sense a matter of self-defence on the part of the
assailants.  They well knew that the garrison in the fort could, by no
possibility, commit aggression upon them; they knew, they were
expressly notified, that the giving of bread to the few brave and
hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be
attempted, unless they themselves, by resisting so much, should
provoke more.  They knew that the Government desired to keep the
garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain
visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and
immediate dissolution, trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time,
discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment, and they assailed
and reduced the fort, for precisely the reverse object, to drive out
the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to
immediate dissolution.  That this was their object the Executive well
understood; and having said to them in the Inaugural Address, "You can
have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors," he took
pains not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the
case so far from injurious sophistry as that the world should not
misunderstand it.  By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding
circumstances, that point was reached.  Then and thereby the
assailants of the Government began the conflict of arms, without a gun
in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in
the fort, sent to that harbour years before for their own protection,
and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful.  In
this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the
distinct issue-immediate dissolution or blood.  And this issue
embraces more than the fate of these United States.  It presents to
the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic
or democracy, a government of the people by the same people, can or
cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic
foes.  It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too
few in number to control the Administration according to the organic
law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case, or
any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break up the
Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon
the earth.  It forces us to ask, "Is there in all republics this
inherent and fatal weakness?"  Must a Government of necessity be too
strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain
its own existence?  So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to
call out the war power of the Government, and so to resist the force
employed for its destruction by force for its preservation.  The call
was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,
surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectations.
Yet none of the States commonly called Slave States, except Delaware,
gave a regiment through the regular State organisation.  A few
regiments have been organised within some others of those States by
individual enterprise and received into the Government service.  Of
course, the seceded States (so called), and to which Texas had been
joined about the time of the inauguration, gave no troops to the cause
of the Union.  The border States (so called) were not uniform in their
action, some of them being almost for the Union; while in others, as
in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, the Union
sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced.  The course taken in
Virginia was the most remarkable, perhaps the most important.  A
Convention, elected by the people of that State to consider this very
question of disrupting the Federal Union, was in session at the
capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell.</p>

<p rend="center">THE COURSE OF VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed
Union men.  Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter many members
of that majority went over to the original disunion minority, and with
them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union.
Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault
upon Sumter or their great resentment at the Government's resistance
to that assault is not definitely known, although they submitted the
ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people, to be taken on a
day then somewhat more than a month distant.  The Convention and the
Legislature, which was also in session at the same time and place,
with leading men of the State not members of either, immediately
commenced acting as if the State was already out of the Union.  They
pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the State;
they seized the United States' Armoury at Harper's Ferry and the Navy
Yard at Gosport, near Norfolk; they received, perhaps invited, into
their State large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments,
from the so-called seceded State; they formally entered into a treaty
of temporary alliance with the so-called Confederate States, and sent
members to their Congress at Montgomery; and, finally, they permitted
the insurrectionary Government to be transferred to their capital at
Richmond.  The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant
insurrection to make its nest within her borders, and thus Government
has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it, and it has
the less to regret as the loyal citizens have in due form claimed its
protection.  These loyal citizens this Government is bound to
recognise and protect as being in Virginia.  In the border States
(so-called)-in fact, the middle States-there are those who favour a
policy which they call armed neutrality-that is, an arming of these
States to prevent the Union forces passing one way or the Disunionists
the other over their soil.  This would be disunion completed.
Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall
along the line of separation, and yet not quite an impassable one,
for, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of the
Union men, and freely pass supplies from among them to the
insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy; at a stroke
it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only
what proceeds from the external blockade.  It would do for the
Disunionists that which of all things they most desire-feed them well,
and give them disunion without a struggle of their own.  It recognises
no fidelity to the Constitution-no obligation to maintain the Union;
and, while very many who have favoured it-all, doubtless, loyal
citizens-it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Recurring to the action of the Government, it may be stated that at
first a call was made for 75,000 militia; and rapidly following this a
proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary
districts, by proceedings in the nature of a blockade.  So far all was
believed to be strictly legal.</p>

<p>At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter
upon the practice of privateering.</p>

<p>Other calls were made for volunteers to serve three years, unless
sooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army
and navy.  These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were
ventured upon under what appeared to be a popular demand and a popular
necessity, trusting, then as now, that Congress would readily ratify
them.  It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the
constitutional competency of Congress.  Soon after the first call for
militia it was considered a duty to authorise the commanding General,
in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and
detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law,
such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety.
This authority has purposely been exercised, but very sparingly.
Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under
it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called to
the proposition that one who has sworn to take care that the laws be
faithfully executed should not himself violate them.  Of course some
consideration was given to the question of power and propriety before
the matter was acted upon.  The whole of the laws which were required
to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution
in nearly one-third of the States.  Must they be allowed to finally
fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that, by the use
of the means necessary to their execution, some single law made in
such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it
relieves more of the guilty than the innocent, should to a very
limited extent be violated?  To state the question more directly, are
all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the Government itself to go
to pieces lest that one should be violated.  Even in such a case would
not the official oath be broken if the Government should be overthrown
when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to
preserve it.  But it was not believed that this question was
presented-it was not believed that any law was violated.  The
provision of the Constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or
invasion, the public safety may require it, is equivalent to a
provision that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of
rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it.  It was
decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety
does require the qualified suspension of privilege of the writ, which
was authorised to be made.  Now, it is insisted that Congress, and not
the Executive, is vested with this power; but the Constitution itself
is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power, and, as the
provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be
believed that the framers of the instrument intended that in every
case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called
together, the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was
intended in this case, by the rebellion.  No more extended argument is
now afforded, as an opinion at some length will probably be presented
by the Attorney-General.  Whether there shall be any legislation on
the subject, and if so what, is submitted entirely to the better
judgment of Congress.  The forbearance of this Government had been so
extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to
shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our
national Union was probable.  While this, on discovery, gave the
Executive some concern, he is now happy to say that the sovereignty
and rights of the United States are now everywhere practically
respected by foreign Powers, and a general sympathy with the country
is manifested throughout the world.</p>

<p>The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy
will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient
for your deliberation and action, while the Executive and all the
Departments will stand ready to supply omissions or to communicate new
facts considered important for you to know.</p>

<p rend="center">DEMAND FOR 400,000 MEN AND 400,000,000 DOLLARS.</p>

<p>It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this
contest a short and decisive one; that you place at the control of the
Government for that purpose at least 400,000 men and 4,000,000
dollars.  That number of men is one-tenth of those of proper age
within the regions where apparently all are willing to engage, and the
sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the
men who seem ready to devote the whole.  A debt of 600,000,000 dollars
now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolutionists
when we came out of that struggle, and the money value in the country
bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the
population.  Surely, each man has as strong a motive now to preserve
our liberties as each had then to establish them.</p>

<p>A right result at this time will be more to the world than ten
times the men and ten times the money.  The evidence reaching us from
the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is
abundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it
legal sanction, and the hand of the Executive to give it practical
shape and efficiency.  One of the greatest perplexities of the
Government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for
them: in a word, the people will save their Government if the
Government itself will only do its part indifferently well.  It might
seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present
movement at the South be called secession or rebellion; the movers,
however, well understand the difference.  At the beginning they knew
they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by
any name which implies violation of law.  They knew the people
possessed as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and
order, and as much pride in its reverence for the history and
government of their common country as any other civilised and
patriotic people.  They knew they could make no advancement directly
in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments.  Accordingly, they
commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind; they invented
an ingenious sophism, which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly
logical steps through all the incidence of the complete destruction of
the Union.  The sophism itself is, that any State of the Union may
consistently with the nation's Constitution, and therefore lawfully
and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without the consent of the
Union or of any other State.</p>

<p rend="center">SOPHISMS OF THE SECESSIONISTS.</p>

<p>The little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only
for a just cause, themselves to be the sole judges of its justice, is
too thin to merit any notice with rebellion.  Thus, sugar-coated, they
have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than
thirty years, until at length they have brought many good men to a
willingness to take up arms against the Government the day after some
assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretense of taking their
State out of Union, who could have been brought to no such thing the
day before.  This sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its
currency from the assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred
supremacy pertaining to a State-to each State of our Federal Union.
Our States have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them
in the Union by the Constitution, no one of them having been a State
out of Union.  The original ones passed into the Union even before
they cast off their British colonial dependence, and the new ones come
into the Union directly from a condition of dependence, excepting
Texas, and even Texas, in its temporary independence, was never
designated a State.  The new ones only took the designation of States
on coming into the Union, while that name was first adopted for the
old ones in and by the Declaration of Independence.  Therein the
united colonies were declared to be free and independent States.  But
even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence of
one another of the Union, but directly the contrary, as their mutual
pledge and their mutual action before, at the time, and afterwards,
abundantly show.  The express plighting of faith by each and all of
the original thirteen States in the articles of confederation, two
years later, that the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive,
having never been States either in substance or in name outside of the
Union.  Whence this magical omnipotence of State rights asserting a
claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself?</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p>Much is said about the sovereignty of the States; but the word,
even, is not in the national Constitution, nor, as is believed, in any
of the State Constitutions.  What is a Sovereignty in the political
sense of the term?  Would it be far wrong to define it to be a
political community without a political superior?  Tested thus, no one
of our States, except Texas, was a Sovereignty; and even Texas gave up
the character on coming into the Union, by which act she acknowledged
the Constitution of the United States, and the laws and treaties of
the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be for her
the supreme law.  The States have their status in the Union, and they
have no other local status.  If they break from this they can only do
so against law and by revolution.  The Union, and not themselves
separately, procured their independence and their liberty, by conquest
or purchase.  The Union gave each of them whatever of independence and
liberty it has.  The Union is older than any of the States, and, in
fact, it created them as States.  Originally, some dependent colonies
made the Union, and in turn the Union threw off their old dependence
for them, and made them States such as they now are.  Not one of them
ever had a State Constitution independent of the Union.  Of course, it
is not forgotten that all the new States formed their Constitutions
before they entered the Union, nevertheless dependent upon and
preparatory to coming into the Union.  Unquestionably, the States have
the power and rights reserved to them in and by the national
Constitution.  But among those surely are not included all conceivable
powers, however mischievous or destructive, but at most such only as
were known in the world as governmental powers; and certainly a power
to destroy the Government itself had never been known as a
governmental power.  This relative matter of national power and State
rights, as a principle, is no other than the principle of generality
and locality; whatever concerns the whole should be confined to whole
general government, while whatever concerns the State should be left
exclusively to the State.  This is all there is of original principle
about it.  Whether the National Constitution, in defining boundaries
between the two, has applied the principle with exact accuracy is not
to be questioned.  We are all bound by that defining without
question.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SECESSION FALLACY.</p>

<p>What is now combated is the position that secession is consistent
with the Constitution, is lawful and peaceful.  It is not contended
that there is any express law for it, and nothing should ever be
implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences.  The
nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of
these States were formed.  Is it just that they shall go off without
leave, and without refunding?  The nation paid very large sums-in the
aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions, to relieve Florida of
the aboriginal tribes.  Is it just that she shall now be off without
consent, or without any return?  The nation is now in debt for money
applied to the benefit of these (so-called) Seceding States in common
with the rest.  Is it just either that creditors should go unpaid, or
the remaining States pay the whole?  A part of the present national
debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas.  Is it just that
she shall leave, and pay no part of this herself?  Again, if one State
may secede, so may another; and when all shall have seceded none will
be left to pay the debts.  Is this quite just to creditors?  Did we
notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?
If we now recognise this doctrine, by allowing the seceders to go in
peace, it is difficult to see what we can do if others chose to go or
to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain.  The seceders
insist that our Constitution admits of secession.  They have assumed
to make a national Constitution of their own, in which, of necessity,
they have either discarded or retained the right of secession as they
insist it exists in ours.  If they have discarded it, they thereby
admit that, on principle, it ought not exist in ours; if they have
retained it, by their own con-<pb n="96"/>struction of ours
they show that, to be consistent, they must secede from one another
whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts or
effecting any selfish or unjust object.  The principle itself is one
of disintegration, and upon which no Government can possibly endure.
If all States save one should assert the power to drive that one out
of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceded politicians
would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest
outrage upon State rights.  But, suppose that precisely the same act,
instead of being called driving the one out, should be called the
seceding of the others from that one, it would be exactly what the
seceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make the point that the
one, because it is a minority, may rightfully do what the others,
because they are a majority, may not rightfully do.</p>


<p rend="center">THE REBEL POLITICIANS IGNORE THE PEOPLE.</p>

<p>These politicians are subtle and profound in the rights of
minorities.  They are not partial to that power which made the
Constitution and speaks from the preamble calling itself "We, the
people."  It may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority
of the legally-qualified votes of any State, except, perhaps, South
Carolina, in favour of disunion.  There is much reason to believe that
the Union men are the majority in many, if not in every one, of the
so-called Seceded States.  The contrary has not been demonstrated in
any one of them.  It is ventured to affirm this even of Virginia and
Tennessee; for the result of an election had in military camps, where
their bayonets are all one side of the question voted upon, can
scarcely be considered as demonstrating popular sentiment.  At such an
election all that large class who are at once for the Union, and
against coercion, would be coerced to vote against the Union.  It may
be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we enjoy
have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole
people beyond any example in the world.  Of this we now have a
striking and impressive illustration.  So large an army as the
Government has now on foot was never before known without a soldier in
it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice.  But,
more than this, there are many single regiments whose members, one and
another, possess full practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences,
professions, and whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in
the whole world, and there is scarcely one from which there could not
be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a Court,
abundantly competent to administer the Government itself.  Nor do I
say this is not true also in the army of our late friends, now
adversaries, in this contest.  But it is so much more the reason why
the Government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us
should not be broken up.  Whoever, in any section, proposes to abandon
such a Government would do well to consider in deference to what
principle it is that he does it-what better he is likely to get in its
stead-whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, so
much of good to the people?  There are some foreshadowings on this
subject.  Our adversaries have adopted some declarations of
independence, in which, unlike the good old one penned by Jefferson,
they omit the words "all men are created equal."  Why?  They have
adopted a temporary national Constitution, in the preamble of which,
unlike our good old one, signed by Washington, they omit "We, the
people," and substitute "We, the deputies of the sovereign and
independent States."  Why?  Why this deliberate pressing out of view
the rights of men and the authority of the people.  This is
essentially a people's contest.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LEADING OBJECT OF THE UNION.</p>

<p>On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the
world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to
elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial weights from all
shoulders, to clear the paths of pursuit for all, and to afford all an
unfettered share and a fair chance in a race of life, yielding to
partial and temporary departures from necessity.  This is the leading
object of the Government for whose existence we contend.</p>

<p rend="center">FIDELITY OF THE ARMY AND NAVY.</p>

<p>I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and
appreciate this.  It is worthy of note that while in this the
Government's hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy
who have been favoured with offices have resigned, and proved false to
the hand which pampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor
is known to have deserted his flag.  Great honour is due to those
officers who remained true despite the example of their treacherous
associates; but the greatest honour, and the most important fact of
all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and common
sailors.  To the last man, so far as known, they have successfully
resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands but an hour
before they obeyed as absolute law.  This is the patriotic instinct of
plain people.  They understand without an argument that the destroying
the Government which was made by Washington means no good to them.
Our popular Government has often been called an experiment.  Two
points in it our people have settled-the successful establishing and
the successful administering of it.  One still remains-its successful
maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it.</p>

<p>It is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can
fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots
are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets, and that when
ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided there can be no
successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful
appeal except to ballots themselves.  At succeeding elections such
will be a great lesson of peace, teaching men that what they cannot
take by an election neither can they take by war-teaching all the
folly of being the beginners of a war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SOUTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>Lest there should be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as
to what is to be the course of the Government towards the Southern
States after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive
deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be
guided by the Constitution and the laws, and that he probably will
have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the
Federal Government, relatively to the rights of the States and the
people under the Constitution, than that expressed in the Inaugural
Address.</p>

<p>He desires to preserve the Government, that it may be administered
for all as it was administered by the men who made it.  Loyal citizens
everywhere have the right to claim this of their Government, and the
Government has no right to withhold or neglect it.  It is not
perceived that in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest, or
any subjugation, in any just sense of these terms.</p>

<p>The Constitution provided, and all the States have accepted the
provision, "That the United States shall guarantee to every State in
this Union a republican form of government."  But if a State may
lawfully go out of the Union, having done so, it may also discard the
republican form of government; so that to prevent its going out is an
indispensable means to the end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned,
and, when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to
it are also lawful and obligatory.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DUTY OF THE PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty of
employing the war power in defence of the Government.  Forced upon
him, he could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the
Government.  No compromise by public servants could, in this case, be
a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular
Government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an
election can only save the Government from immediate destruction by
giving up the main point upon which the people gave the election.  The
people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their
own deliberate decisions.</p>

<p>As a private citizen, the Executive could not have consented that
these institutions shall perish, much less could he in betrayal of so
vast and so sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him.
He felt that he had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the
chances of his own life in what might follow.</p>

<p>In full view of his great responsibility, he has so far done what
he has deemed his duty.  You will now, according to your own judgment,
perform yours.  He sincerely hopes that your views and your actions
may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who have
been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to
them under the Constitution and the laws, and, having thus chosen our
course, without guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in
God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts.</p>

<p>The New York Post says the Wall-street bankers on the 9th subscribed
the full amount of a five-million loan in forty minutes.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the North Briton at Londonderry we have telegrams
to the 20th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>Major-General M'Clellan has won a succession of victories over the
Confederates in Western Virginia, which enables him to report that he
firmly believes Secession is killed in that section of the country.
On the 12th a division of Federals, led by General Rosencrantz, drove
the enemy from an intrenched camp at Rich Mountain, near Beverley.  On
the 13th General M'Clellan pushed on to Beverely, and captured six
brass cannon, of which one was rifled, and all the camp equipage and
transportation waggons.  The enemy lost in killed and wounded 150 men,
and at least 100 prisoners.  The Federals lost in this second
engagement 11 killed and 35 wounded.  On the same day General
M'Clellan received from Colonel Pegrain (not Pogram) propositions for
the surrender of his whole command, numbering 600 men.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 14th, General Garnett and his forces were
routed at Carrackford, near St George, and his baggage and one gun
taken.  General Garnett was killed in the engagement.  The Confederate
loss was not far from 200 killed and a number of prisoners.  The
Federals report a loss of 13 killed and 40 wounded.  The troops
engaged in these affairs were chiefly from Ohio and Indiana.</p>

<p>The main body of the Federal Army of the centre, numbering 55,000
men, and commanded by General M'Dowell, began its march towards
Richmond on the 17th ult.  They met with no serious resistance until
they reached Dulbram, a fortified position, three miles from Manassas
Junction.  On the 18th the advanced guard of the Federals attacked
this position and was repulsed.  Afterwards, however, the position was
carried.  At the last accounts the two armies were within a mile of
each other near Manassas Junction, and a battle seemed inevitable on
the next day (Sunday) or Monday, the 22nd ult.</p>

<p>General Patterson, who was last heard of at Martinsburg, has been
superseded by Major-General Banks.  General Dix succeeds General Banks
in command at Baltimore.</p>

<p>The Federal Government has decided that no more fugitive slaves
shall be allowed in camp.</p>

<p>In Missouri Colonel Siegel has gained another advantage over the
State troops.</p>

<p>The Confederate privateer Sumpter, which escaped from New Orleans,
made for Cuba, where she seized eight Northern vessels, six of which
were run into Cienfuegos and one was burned.  The Governor-General of
Cuba allowed the privateer to coal and water, but retained the prizes.
One of them which had been sent home under a prize crew was taken into
a Northern port, the crew revolting and being unwilling to return to
the Sumpter.  Two of this crew were Englishmen.</p>

<p>Galveston, Texas, was blockaded on the 2nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The opposition to the war party in Congress never divides more than
ten in the House of Representatives, and not above half that number in
the Senate.  Four Northern Democrats only adhere to the cause of
peaceable separation.  The chief speakers against the war in the
Senate are-Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, and in the House
Messrs. Burnett, of the same State, and Vallandingham, of Ohio.</p>

<p>Messrs. Carlile and Wiley, of Western Virginia, have been admitted
to seats in the Senate, as lawfully representing Virginia, in lieu of
Messrs. Hunter and Mason, expelled for treasonable conduct.</p>

<p>The military authorities exercise a censorship over the telegrams
sent by correspondents at Washington to the Northern press, and will
not let anything pass the knowledge of which may be of service to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury raised 5,000,000 dols. in Treasury
notes, at par, in the New York money market in forty minutes; the
energetic course of the Government in suppressing the revolution
having infused new confidence into the capitalists.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The eighty-fifth anniversary of American Independence was observed
with the usual &eacute;clat throughout the South.</p>

<p>Vice-President Stephens is delivering public harangues in the Gulf
States in behalf of the produce loan of the Southern Government.</p>

<p>The usual mail facilities are still extended to the people of East
Tennessee by the Federal Government in consideration of their
loyalty.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>There is much suffering among the working classes and the families
of the volunteers in New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis.  In New
York the Common Council have voted 500,000 dols. towards the relief of
the needy.</p>

<p>The particulars of the accident which proved fatal to
Mrs. Longfellow are as follow:-She was engaged in making wax seals in
the library for the amusement of her two youngest children, when her
dress caught fire from a match with which she was melting the wax.
She had on a light summer dress, which was all in flames in a moment.
Mr. Longfellow, who was in his study near by, ran to her assistance,
and succeeded in extinguishing the flames, with considerable injury to
himself, but too late to save the life of his wife.  She was the
daughter of the Hon. Nathan Appleton, of Boston, and leaves a family
of five children-three of them daughters and two sons.</p>

<p>The trade returns of the port of New York show to what an extent the
import trade of that port has suffered in consequence of the war.  For
the week ending July 13 there were imported of dry goods only 226,388
dols. worth, against 1,776,456 dols. for the corresponding week of
last year, and 2,630,240 dols. in 1859.</p>

<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">AD</hi> news is, in all probability, crossing
the Atlantic.  The last mails have spoken of the advance of the
Federal army upon the Confederates, and we hear of a repulse of the
former, and then of its success in carrying a disputed position.  This
information, of course, comes through Northern channels, and we have
not yet learned to accept, unhesitantly, every statement so
transmitted.  But there seems no reason to doubt that the armies were
drawing very close, and if the journals that "expect" a battle "to-day
or to-morrow" are to be relied upon it could hardly be many days
before thousands of men, speaking the same language, and but the other
day proud of being governed by the same rulers, would be hurled upon
one another in fierce conflict.  A spot called Manassas Junction was
indicated as the probable scene of the expected engagement. Some
superseding of Federal Generals on the eve of fighting might not seem
a good augury for the North; but, if the accounts as to the numbers of
the forces be trustworthy, it is difficult to understand how an
experienced soldier like General Scott can fail to be victorious.
Private letters say that the authorities at Washington have no such
ideas as are promulgated by journalists about bringing the war to a
rapid termination, and that they do not contemplate the final
subjugation of the South in less than two campaigns.  In far less time
than such protracted operations will require the pacification of the
States will, we hope, be effected by other agency.  Meantime, we await
the arrival of the first important news that has been dispatched since
the declaration-we do not to say of war-but of "action" by the
belligerents.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> July 4, the anniversary of American
Independence, 20,000 troops belonging to the State of New York alone
were passed in review before the President and General Scott.  Many of
the Secretaries of the different departments were present, among whom
Mr. Seward occupied a prominent position on the right of the
Commander-in-Chief.  The moment taken by our Special Artist for his
sketch of this imposing ceremony, engraved on page 111, was when the
Garibaldi Guard was marching past.  As each company came in front of
General Scott the men took the green sprigs they had fastened amid
their cock feathers and threw them towards the old chieftain.  The
Garibaldi Guard is composed of Hungarians, Germans, Swiss, Italians,
and French, and they are uniformed after the fashion of the Sardinian
Bersaglieri.</p>

<p rend="center">(From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.)</p> 

<p rend="right">Federal Camp, Virginia, July 7.</p>

<p>THERE are many, no doubt, who on reading a correspondent's letter
envy him the life of excitement he is supposed to lead with an army in
the field.  They would gladly forego their home comforts for the
assumed pleasures of a camp existence, convinced that a night between
regulation blankets, on a straw mattress, with rank grass for a
bedstead, is as comfortable as the peaceful slumber they enjoy betwixt
their own white sheetings.  Breakfast at nine, lunch at two, and
dinner at six are conventionalities they are prepared to repudiate,
preferring infinitely for the time being a simple diet of simple
luxuries eaten in a simple fashion-that is, with the fingers.  They
picture to themselves the air filled with martial music, the march
through shady forests in the "old dominion" of Virginia, the
occasional halts amidst romantic scenery, the bath at some crystal
spring, with a silvery cascade leaping over moss-covered stones, and
invigorating the wearied frame of the campaigner with its refreshing
temperature.  In the cool of the evening, as they smoke their cigars
in suburban summer-houses, reading "Our Special's" letter, they pine
to be on tented plains.  As they puff the blue cloud from the fragrant
British havannah a mirage of a canvas city, transparent with light,
floats before their excited imaginations.  Passing the threshold of a
tent in their dreamy excursion to the realms of fancy, they behold a
merry group of men-at-arms jovially engaged in killing time instead of
the enemy, some lounging in rocking-chairs, others reclining at length
on the velvety sward, and all imbibing nectar in the shape of mint
juleps, brandy smashes, gin cocktails, port wine sangarees, and
whiskey punches.  Such, my friends, is the romance of campaigning;
read on, and you will see the reality.</p>

<p>My location at present is near a place called "Ball's Cross Roads,"
on the Virginia shore of the Potomac.  In the early hours of the
morning and in the evening moving about the neighbourhood is like
wading through a morass, so heavy falls the dew, while during the
other portion of the day the sun strikes with such intensity on the
camp that one scarcely dares quit shelter for fear of coup de soleil,
and to remain in the interior of your tent is to risk being parboiled.
At four a.m. the drum beats the rveille close to your head just as
you have done battling with myriads of bloodthirsty mosquitos and
other nameless  insects, and are getting into your first sleep.  At
five there is another roll for company drill; and, unless you want to
go without your breakfast, you must be up and dressed by six.
Dressing occupies but a short time, there being very little to take
off on going to bed, and, consequently, very little to put on on
rising.  Happy is he who does not find a juvenile rattlesnake in his
boot.  Apropos of snakes in boots, I had a curious incident related to
me the other day.  An officer who had been warned over night by some
of his comrades against such intrusions, and being advised to shake
his leathers well before donning them, treated the matter very
lightly, and thought it a useless precaution to take, as, in the first
place, he did not believe a snake would seek lodgings in his
wellingtons, and, in the second, he thought that a good stamp on any
foreign substance would settle the affair satisfactorily.  The next
morning frightful yells were heard issuing from the unbeliever's tent;
there were shrieks of "Murder!" coupled with implorings for the
doctor; and, on his neighbours rushing to his assistance, they found
him limping about with one boot on, which he begged with an agonizing
expression they would immediately cut off.  He screamed out there was
a snake in it, which had bitten him badly, and that the more he
crushed it the deeper it inserted his fangs, and he was sure he had
but a few moments to live.  The doctor soon made his appearance and
commenced ripping the boot from the leg, when, to the surprise of
every one, out dropped a spur covered with blood.  The patient's
nigger had the preceding evening unbuckled both these appendages, and
had thoughtlessly inserted one in each boot for safety.</p>

<p>The crystal spring alluded to in the fanciful sketch of campaigning
is, in my case, a yellow, sluggish stream, flowing lazily through a
deep, wooded dell (all the water in Virginia appears to me to be of
the colour and consistency of pea-soup, except here and there a
drinking-spring), and in this I take my bath, feeling infinitely more
dirty afterwards than I did before.  The first morning I performed my
ablutions in this main sewer of a clayey range of hills I disturbed by
my riotous immersion a considerable family of the amphibious
serpentine species (you see I am obligated to return to my snakes),
which wriggled off in every direction, leaving me, terrified,
mid-stream.  In my anxiety to escape I dragged myself up the bank
through a thicket of briars, and I still feel the smarts as I write
this.  Custom, however, hardens one to anything; and I and the snakes
now disport ourselves with mutual confidence in our mud bath.  By the
time the laving process is achieved breakfast claims one's attention,
and the savoury smells from Charley's kitchen lead you by the nose to
the mess-tent.  I declare that our sable maitre d'htel has improvised
us some prime rump-steak.  Crunch! how tough it is!  "Why, where on
earth did you get this, Charley?" "Get it, sar? Why, yer heerd last
night a sentry shoot a Secesh, after tattoo?"  Gracious goodness!
surely the Ethiopian don't intend to make cannibals of us!  "Well,
sar, it warn't a Secesh at all; it war the Secesh farmer's ole cow;
and, as this nigger discubbered her fust, weltering in her gauze, I
thought mebbe the genlemen ud like to hab a under cut.  Ugh! ugh! ugh!
Berry excellent meat, sar!"  Shades of the Old Cheshire Cheese! how I
pine after my accustomed "steak and mashed powtaturs, down together"!
Give me the Moore of Wine-office-court in place of the wretched Moor
that caters for me now.  After an unsatisfactory meal comes the hot,
dried-up day, throughout which you are wretchedly uncomfortable.
Flies and mosquitos fight their battles on each uncovered portion of
your skin; the perspiration oozes from every pore in your body.  You
try to do some work, and immediately you have a dozen visitors from
neighbouring tents, who fan and fume all round the place, distracted
themselves and distracting you.  An indifferent dinner at last comes
as a kind of break to your misery, and the whole closes with infinite
pipe-smoking, and any amount of bad whiskey for those who like it.
Such is our camp life, rooted to the same spot, with no change of
scene, the only incidents to enliven one being an occasional skirmish
with the enemy's pickets, all of which I have sent you sketches of.
As yet I have hardly dared absent myself for a day, as in front of
this position the great battle will be fought.</p>

<p>What cannot fail to interest your readers greatly will be an effort
on my part to explain the positions of the Confederate and Federal
forces as they are now relatively placed.  The extreme right of the
Secessionist army is at Norfolk, in Eastern Virginia.  Their centre
may be said to extend from Richmond to Manassas Gap, running
north-west, and their left rests on Winchester, in the western part of
the "Old Dominion;" and it is undoubtedly in this State that all the
important fighting will take place.  Beyond comes Kentucky, neutral,
splitting, as it were, the line of operations into two distinct
aggressive and defensive movements.  In Missouri the Confederates have
their left, in the neighbourhood of Carthage, and their right
threatening Cairo, on the extreme southern border of Illinois.
Opposed to their left is General Lyons, who menaces them in that
quarter, while General Prentiss, in command at Cairo, shows a good
front to their right attack.  But the greatest interest unquestionably
lies in Virginia, where the most considerable force on both sides is
brought into the field.  Generals Patterson and M'Lellan, after
certain successful movements on the Upper Potomac, are about to form a
junction in the neighbourhood of Winchester, and we may expect daily
to hear of them giving the Disunionists battle.  General M'Dowell, in
command at Alexandria, on the right bank of the Potomac, opposite to
Washington, threatens the Secessionist positions at Fairfax and
Manassas Gap; while General Butler, at Fortress Monroe, in the
Chesapeake Bay, is awaiting orders to march in the direction of
Norfolk (notwithstanding his reverse at Big Bethel) with a flanking
movement on Richmond.  If your readers will just glance at the map of
the United States they will be able readily to follow out my
description.  General Scott, the veteran of the Mexican  war, commands
in chief, and though his head is blanched with the snows of
seventy-five winters, and his frame enfeebled by the hardships of more
than half a century of service, yet his energy and intellect are as
unimpaired as when he gained his old victories.  General Mansfield
acts as his Lieutenant.</p>

<p>A few remarks in reference to the organisation of the Union Army
will not be thrown away here.  For a country like the United
States-recollect I am speaking of only the northern division-to place
150,000 men in the field armed and equipped in the short space of
little better than two months is indeed surprising.  When I say
150,000 men I mean those actually in line of battle; not including the
untold legions on their way to the seat of war and others drilling in
the various States to which they belong.  Your readers, to realise the
energy that has been displayed, must take into consideration the fact
that the standing army has scarcely ever exceeded 15,000; and that
almost every man now called upon to serve has been enrolled, clothed,
armed, and drilled in the period above mentioned.  I do not mean to
assert that this army goes to the field in as serviceable a condition
as a European one of similar proportions; for in the essential of
cavalry they are lamentably deficient.  But perfection is not to be
expected from a country that has never laid claim to be considered a
military Power, though I very much doubt if America won't proudly
assert her right to such distinction before the close of the
lamentable strife she is now engaged in.  To one fact I can bear
positive testimony, which is, that no other nation could bring into
array a more goodly show of sinew and muscle.  There are regiments
taken from among the hardy sons of Maine, Michigan, Vermont,
Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Iowa, men who gain their bread by
following avocetions in which physical strength and endurance go for
more than mental capacity.  It is not by any means uncommon to see in
the ranks huge, brawny fellows, six feet three and four in height,
"boys" who can hand a tree or start a raft over a fall, throttle a
bear, or pole a barge down the rapids, and in whose hands a musket and
bayonet is no more than a toasting-fork.  Of course, every Northern
State gives its quota to the national forces, and I have simply
particularised the above for the sake of introducing some of the
athletae about to enter the arena.  The greatest failing probably in
this army is the want of competent officers.  The men themselves begin
to feel this, and are murmuring openly at the corruptive practices
which take wealthy tradesmen from behind their counters and dub them
Colonels and Majors-General.  Had it not been for this system of
political interestedness the mishaps at Big Bethel and Vienna would
never have occurred, and the term in reference to the conduct of a
commanding officer on one of these occasions, as to "losing his
presence of mind," would probably have been omitted in the reports of
the engagement.  Speaking of engagements, I would here like to put
myself right with you and your readers.  If you do not receive from me
sketches of every action fought, it is because I am unable to make
myself ubiquitous; and it must also be recollected that this is a "big
country," and that the distances between the different columns are
great, and the railroads partially destroyed.  I managed, however, to
pay a flying visit to Patterson's division at Martinsburg, getting up
in time to witness his gallant and successful dash at the Confederate
troops on the Upper Potomac, which occurred on the 2nd ult.  I send
you a Sketch of the advance of the Wisconsin men through the
wheat-fields, after fording the river, to attack the enemy's
position.</p>

<p>We are now daily waiting orders to advance, and when they come some
75,000 troops will be put in motion, advancing on the centre of the
Confederate position.  It is possible the first engagement will take
place at Fairfax, from which we are now distant about eight miles.
Should the Secessionist force, however, retire from that neighbourhood
a great battle cannot fail to be fought at Manassas Gap, twelve miles
further on, where their largest body of troops is assembled.  When we
move there will be an increase of subjects to sketch, and I shall be
able to keep you better supplied than I have hitherto done.</p>

<p>The debates on foreign affairs have been neither numerous nor
remarkable.  There has been an unhappy sameness in them, both as
regards subject and treatment, which has tended to their abbreviation,
and there was, as far as we recollect, not a single instance of a
foregn debate occupying a whole evening. . . . Whenever the state of
things in the United Staes of America has been touched on, it has been
with a praiseworthy reticence; and in this, as in all the rest of our
foreign policy, the great principle of a powerful and watchful
neutrality has been maintained. . . .</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the preceeding [sic] page we give four
Engravings (from drawings made by Mr. Lefevre James Cranstone) in
connection with Richmond, the chief town of Virginia, where the
Southern Congress is now holding its sittings, and which for the time
being takes rank as the capital of the Confederate States of America.
Richmond is situated on the north bank of the James River, about 150
miles from its mouth.  Its chief public building is the State House,
or Capitol, which is finely situated in the middle of a lawn, on the
brow of a hill which overlooks the city.  It is a copy of the Maison
Carr&eacute;e of N&icirc;mes, the plan of which was sent over by Mr. Jefferson,
when he was Ambassador in France.  The Capitol is a principal feature
in the aspect of the city from many points of view.  Virginia is
justly proud of having given birth to Washington, and statues of him
are frequent in the State.  Besides the Washington Statue in the
Capitol at Richmond there is, in the beautiful park of which the city
boasts, an equestrian one of him (given on the preceding page), in
company with statues of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry-all of
which were chiselled in Europe at an immense cost.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF BULL'S RUN.</p>

<p>After the check which the Federalists received on the 18th ult. in
the first assault on the Confederates' position to the south of Bull's
Run-a stream which in England would be called a river-General M'Dowell
contented himself for the two following days with reconnoitring the
position of the enemy.  Finding the position, which was very similar
to that occupied by the Russians at Alma, too strong for an attack in
front, his first idea was to get in the rear of the intrenchments.
The obstacles to the passage of artillery presented by the narrow and
stony roads rendered this plan impracticable. It was therefore
arranged that an attack should be made on the left flank of the enemy,
accompanied by a feint in front.  The day fixed for the general
engagement was Sunday, the 21 ult.  The Federal forces began their
march on this memorable day at half-past two a.m.  The first batteries
opened at five a.m.; but it was not until noon that the infantry
engagement commenced. At this time the Federal front extended over
about five miles.  In the hand-to-hand conflicts the Federals were
uniformly successful, and at length had carried all the works on the
crest of the hill but two or three.  Reinforcements kept continually
arriving to the Confederates from Manassas.  Suddenly, about four
o'clock p.m., an order was given to retreat, and this retreat soon
became a more than disorderly flight.  It appears that an attack of
the Confederate cavalry was made on the baggage and ammunition stores
of the Federalists, which were unprotected by cavalry pickets, as they
should have been.  The teamsters fled in the utmost confusion.  The
ambulance and artillery waggoners cut the horses loose and galloped
towards Washington.  The reserves, attacked in the rear, followed,
escaping over a bridge which the Confederate cavalry either dared not
or could not seize.  Colonel Blenker's regiment, the 8th New York (a
German corps), alone of the reserves remained firm.  When General
M'Dowell found his reserves had fled he gave that order to retreat
which so much surprised some of the Northern regiments.  The retreat
in the face of a pursuing enemy at once became a flight.
Nevertheless, the Federals did not suffer much, as they repulsed the
cavalry on the field of battle, and Colonel Blenker's regiment
protected the rear from Centreville.  The Southern account, by way of
New Orleans and Louisville, informs us that General Johnston (the
report of whose death is one of the many canards to which this affair
has given rise) commanded the Confederate left, "where the enemy made
the fiercest attack."  General Beauregard commanded the right.
President Davis reached the field at noon, and took command of the
centre.  When the left was pressed the severest, the centre engaged a
portion of the enemy's forces, and, it is added, "decided the fortunes
of the day."</p>

<p rend="center">THE FLIGHT.</p>

<p>Everything was abandoned-guns, rifles, the wounded, blankets, knapsacks, ammunition, provisions, waggons-everything that could impede flight-were left behind.  General M'Dowell endeavoured to rally the fugitives at Centreville, and again at Fairfax Court Houes [sic], but in vain.  They only stopped at the Potomac, after a run of twenty-four miles.  Here a regiment on guard at the Long Bridge and the discontinuance of the steam-ferries stopped their further flight, or the army would have dissipated in as many hours as it took months to form.  Yet there was nobody in pursuit.  It was only at eleven p.m. that a small force of cavalry attacked Colonel Blenker's regiment, and were easily repulsed.  This regiment retired from Centreville at about one a.m. on Monday morning, and marched back leisurely to its old encampment opposite Washington, being the only one which retired in a dignified manner.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LOSS.</p>

<p>The loss that the Federalists sustained is said to be "continually
decreasing."  At first represented at 10,000, it has rapidly fallen to
"from 300 to 500" in killed and wounded.  Many regiments were said to
be "cut to pieces" whose members had merely taken to the woods, and
who have since reappeared.  Among the killed is Colonel Cameron, of
the Highland Regiment, and brother of the Secretary of War.  The
Southern loss in probably greater than the Northern in killed and
wounded.  On Monday the Federal cavalry revisited the field of battle,
and brought off some of their derelict artillery.</p>

<p>[We give in the accompanying Supplement a more detailed account of
the battle and of the Federal army's flight.]</p>

<p rend="center">RECEPTION OF THE NEWS.</p>

<p>Congress, on the 22nd, passed resolutions that no disasters,
however overwhelming, would deter them from maintaining the Union.  In
the Senate a resolution confiscating the property (including slaves)
of persons who had taken up arms against the Union was passed by 32
yeas and 6 nays, after a spirited debate.</p>

<p>General M'Dowell was superseded by the Government, and General
M'Clellan appointed in his stead to the command of the Army of the
Potomac.  The Government has since accepted all the troops that have
offered, and show every disposition to continue the contest with
greater vigour than ever.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of the Federalists was received by the
Baltimoreans with joy.  Pictures of General Beauregard were sold in
great numbers.  There was, however, no rioting.</p>

<p>New York passed through several alternations of feeling.  On Sunday
it was believed that a great victory had been won, and there was
exuberant public joy, and some talk of commencing a war with England.
On Monday, when very exaggerated reports of the Federal losses came
in, the joy was turned into consternation, wailing, and cries for
vengeance.  On Tuesday, when the small aggregate of the loss of life
became known, equanimity was restored.</p>

<p rend="center">FEDERAL SUCCESSES.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan, in an address to his "army of the West," boasts
that they have annihilated two armies, taken five guns, twelve
colours, 1500 stand of arms, and 1000 prisoners, including more than
forty officers.  One of the second commanders of the enemy is a
prisoner, the other was killed, more than 250 of the enemy have shared
his fate, together with all the baggage and camp equipage.  All this
had been accomplished with the loss of twenty killed and sixty wounded
on the part of the Union army in Western Virginia.</p>

<p>Two of the prizes captured by the Southern privateers have been
recaptured from the prize crew by the prisoners.  In the case of the
schooner Waring a free coloured man effected the recapture by killing
with his own hand all the prize crew save one, and putting that one in
irons.  He then took command, and brought her in safety to New York.
His motive was the assurance that he should be enslaved if taken into
Charleston.  He is a Rhode Islander, and has become quite a hero in
New York.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>

<p>It is said there are but three United States' vessels blockading
the entire coast of North Carolina, and that the port of Beaufort in
that State is, for the most time, perfectly free from blockade.</p>

<p>The New York Times'  correspondent at Fort Pickens states that
Admiral Milne has informed the British Government that the blockade is
totally inefficient.  This report evidently requires qualification, as
another reporter, for the Tribune, writes that the Admiral was
satisfied that the blockade of the Mississippi at least was
sufficiently effective.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
<p>Stocks fell after the disaster at Bull's Run, but exchange on England
has risen higher than for many months past.  Secretary Chase made
application for a 5,000,000-dollar loan in Treasury notes, but only
half the amount required was offered.</p>

<p>"THE news, long looked for, came at last."  On Sunday London heard
that on the preceding Sunday fortnight the soldiers of the South and
North had met in decisive battle; and we learned that the
Secessionists had inflicted disastrous defeat upon the Federalists.
The details have since arrived; every one has mastered them; and it is
not needful to recapitulate the story of the ill-advised attack, of
scientific defence, of retaliatory onslaught, and of disgraceful
flight.  The day was not done when miles upon miles of the road
between Bull's Run and Fairfax were covered with fugitives from the
apprehended vengeance of the South.  The flight did not end with the
end of possible danger.  The terrified soldiers of the Union continued
to hurry onwards, and their rush was only checked at Washington.  Of
the amount of slaughter we know nothing with certainty, but an army
might have better afforded to lose half its members than to endure the
moral blow which has fallen.  The Palmetto flag is for the time
triumphant.  Fierce is the exultation of the South; deep the
humiliation of the North.  Yet the disaster is perfectly explicable;
and it is much to know the causes of things.  The Southern force was
well disciplined, and was led by men who have studied the art of war.
It was, in great measure, acting on the defensive, in a district
admirably suited for the purpose, and these natural advantages had
been largely improved.  The Northern force rushed upon battle without
due preparation, and it is to the blatant folly of the newspapers
acting upon the weakness of statesmen who fear the mob that this great
disaster is due.  Scott would not have fought until autumn, it is
understood; but the idiot shout "Go ahead!" drove him upon the guns of
the South, and the Union flag has gone down.  On the more disgraceful
part of the story it is painful to dwell.  A battle may be lost; every
battle must be lost as well as won; but panic and cowardly flight,
accompanied by acts of yet more cowardly ferocity, are features in few
of the battles of civilised war.  It is clear that such volunteers as
have yet been raised are not to be depended on for the steadiness
which is the greatest virtue of a soldier, one for which no courage,
no enthusiasm, is an equivalent.  General Scott has to reconstruct his
army and to make it fit for the field; and when we read of new
thousands being poured down as reinforcements, we cannot but ask in
what respect do these promise better than their predecessors?  What,
too, shall be said of the "soldiers" who, because the last day of
their term was up, quitted their fellow-countrymen under the thunder
of the guns of Beauregard?  The whole narrative is too full of
unpleasant features to induce an English writer to dwell upon it.  Nor
will we do more than advert to the savage braggadocio which, at the
moment of an earlier and temporary success, menaced England with the
seizure of Canada in return for her resolve of neutrality.  Had the
Union been less miserably beaten at Bull's Run we might have resented
such wanton and unjust insult; as it is, we are silent.  Let it be
understood, however, wherever English journals are read, that the
victory of the South places its cause in no better position in English
eyes, and that if we see any favourable sign in this opening
misfortune, it is that the South has given such evidence of its
strength that an American statesman who shall, when the Northern
laurels have been somewhat retrieved, suggest a compromise and peace,
will be able to advance the strongest of all arguments-the
impossibility of crushing the enemy.   There was a rumour that, the
Confederates were advancing, and that Harper's Ferry was to be the
next scene of strife.  Possibly, in abandoning a defensive position,
they may forfeit the results of their victory, and yet General
Beauregard does not appear to be a rash and headstrong leader.
Washington has been secured, and the energies of the aged Generals of
the North, nearly all of whom are very old men, are devoted to the
reconstruction of the army.</p>

<p rend="center">BATTLE OF BULL'S RUN.</p>

<p>The Federal army, under General M'Dowell, sustained a
disastrousdefeat at Bull's Run on the 21st ult.  Bull's Run is a
stream which intersects the railway from Alexandria to Manassas, and
the road from Centreville south, running through a succession of
gorges and hills, between steep wooded banks-a kind of Alma, which the
Confederates have occupied strongly in advance of the main line of
their defences.  The most clear and detailed account of the battle
which we have received is contained in the Washington correspondence
of the New York Times of the 23rd ult.  This is dated Washington,
Monday morning, July 22, and is as follows:-</p>

<p>The attack was made in three columns, two of which, however, were
mainly feints, intended to amuse and occupy the enemy, while the
substantial work was done by the third.  It has been known for a long
time that the range of hills which border the small, swampy stream
known as Bull's Run had been very thoroughly and extensively fortified
by the rebels, that batteries had been planted at every available
point, usually concealed in woods and bushes which abound in that
vicinity, and covering every way of approach to the region beyond.
These are the advanced defences of Manassas Junction, which is some
three miles further off.  Until these were carried no approach could
be made to that place; and after they should be carried others of a
similar character would have to be overcome at every point where they
could be erected.  The utmost <pb n="143"/>

      <figure>
         <head>MAP OF DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</head>
      </figure>

that military skill and
ingenuity could accomplish for the defence of this point was done.
General M'Dowell was unwilling to make an attack directly in face of
these batteries, as they would be doubtful issue, and must inevitably
result in a very serious loss of life.  After an attack had been
resolved upon, therefore, he endeavoured to find some way of turning
the position.  His first intention was to do this on the southern
side-to throw a strong column into the place from that direction,
while a feigned attack should be made in front.  On Thursday, when the
troops were advanced to Centreville, it was found that the roads on
the south side of these positions was [sic] almost impracticable-that
they were narrow, crooked, and stony, and that it would be almost
impossible to bring up enough artillery to be effective in the time
required.  This original plan was, therefore, abandoned; and Friday
was devoted to an examination by the topographical engineers of the
northern side of the position.  Major Barnard and Captain Whipple
reconnoitred the place for miles around, and reported that the
position could be entered by a path coming from the north, although it
was somewhat long and circuitous.  This was selected, therefore, as
the mode and point of attack.</p>

<p>On Saturday the troops were all brought closely up to Centreville,
and all needful preparations were made for the attack which was
intended for the next day.  Yesterday morning, therefore, the army
marched-by two roads-Colonel Richardson with his command taking the
southern, which leads to Bull's Run, and General Taylor the
northern-running parallel to it at a distance of about a mile and a
half.  The movement commenced at about three o'clock.  I got up at a
little before four, and found the long line of troops extended far out
on either road.  I took the road by which Colonel Hunter with his
command, and General M'Dowell and Staff, had gone, and pushed on
directly for the front.  After going out about two miles Colonel
Hunter turned to the right, marching obliquely towards the Run, which
he was to cross some four miles higher up, and then come down upon the
intrenched positions of the enemy on the other side.  Colonel Miles
was left at Centerville and on the road, with reserves which he was to
bring up whenever they might be needed.  General Tyler went directly
forward, to engage the enemy in front, and send reinforcements to
Colonel Hunter whenever it should be seen that he was engaged.</p>

<p>I went out, as I have already stated, upon what is marked as the
northern road.  It is hilly, like all the surface of this section.
After going out about three miles you come to a point down which the
road, leading through a forest, descends; then it proceeds by a
succession of rising and falling knolls for a quarter of a mile, when
it crosses a stone bridge and then ascends by a steady slope to the
heights beyond.  At the top of that slope the rebels had planted heavy
batteries, and the woods below were filled with their troops and with
concealed cannon.  We proceeded down the road to the first of the
small knolls mentioned, when the whole column halted.  The 30-pounder
Parrott gun, which has a longer range than any other in the army, was
planted directly in the road. Captain Ayres' battery was stationed in
the woods a little to the right.  The 1st Ohio and 2nd New York
Regiments were thrown into the woods in advance on the left.  The 69th
New York and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Connecticut Regiments were ranged
behind them, and the 2nd Wisconsin was thrown into the woods on the
right.  At about half past six o'clock the 30-pounder threw two shells
directly into the battery at the summit of the slope, on the opposite
height, one of which, as I learned afterwards, struck and exploded
directly in the midst of the battery, and occasioned the utmost havoc
and confusion.  After about half an hour Captain Ayres threw ten or
fifteen shot and shell from his battery into the same place.  But both
failed to elicit any reply.  Men could be seen moving about the
opposite slope, but the batteries were silent.  An hour or so
afterwards we heard three or four heavy guns from Colonel Richardson's
column at Bull's Run, and these were continued at intervals for two or
three hours, but they were not answered even by a single gun.  It was
very clear that the enemy intended to take his own time for paying his
respects to us, and that he meant, moreover, to do it in his own way.
Meantime we could hear in the distance the sound of Colonel Hunter's
axemen clearing his way, and awaited with some impatience the sound of
his cannon on the opposite heights.  Time wore along with occasional
shots from our guns, as well as those of Colonel Richardson's column,
but without, in a single instance, receiving any reply.</p>

<p>At a little before eleven o'clock the 1st Ohio and 2nd New York,
which were lying in the wood on the left, were ordered to advance.
They did so-passing out of the road and climbing a fence into a wood
opposite, which they had barely approached, however, when they were
met by a tremendous discharge of a four-gun battery, planted at the
left in the woods, mainly for the purpose of sweeping the road
perpendicularly and the open field on its right, by which alone troops
could pass forward to the opposite bank.  They were staggered for a
moment, and received orders to retire.  Captain Ayres' battery
(formerly Sherman's) was advanced a little, so as to command this
battery, and by twenty minutes of vigorous play upon it silenced it
completely.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven we heard Hunter's guns on the opposite height,
over a mile to the right.  He was answered by batteries there, and
then followed the sharp, rattling, volleys of musketry, as their
infantry became engaged.   The firing was now incessant.  Hunter had
come upon them suddenly, and formed his line of  battle in an open
field, at the right of the road.  The enemy drew  up to oppose him,
but he speedily drove them to retreat, and followed them up with the
greatest vigour and rapidity.  Meantime, for some three hours
previous, we had seen long lines of dense dust rising from the roads
leaving from Manassas, and, with the glass, we could very clearly
perceive that they were raised by the constant and steady stream of
reinforcements, which continued to pour in nearly the whole day.   The
69th, 79th, 2nd and 8th New York-the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Connecticut,
and the 2nd Wisconsin-were brought forward in advance of the wood and
marched across the field to the right, to go to Colonel Hunter's
support.  They crossed the intervening stream and drew up in a small
open field, separated from Colonel Hunter's column by a dense wood,
which was filled with batteries and infantry.  Our guns continued to
play upon the woods which thus concealed the enemy, and aided
materially in clearing them for the advance.  [Only by] going down to
the extreme front of the column, could I watch the progress of Colonel
Hunter, marked by the constant roar of artillery and the roll of
musketry, as he pushed the rebels back from point to point.  At one
o'clock he had driven them out of the woods and across the road which
was the prolongation of that on which we stood.  Here, by the side of
their batteries, the rebels made a stand.  They planted their flag
directly in the road, and twice charged across it upon our men, but
without moving them an inch.  They were met by a destructive fire, and
were compelled to fall still further back.  Gradually the point of
fire passed further away, until the dense  clouds of smoke which
marked the progress of the combat were at least half a mile to the
left of what had been  the central position of the rebels.</p>

<p>It was now half-past two o'clock.  I was at the advanced point of
the front of our column, some hundred rods beyond the woods, in which
the few troops then there were drawn up, when I decided to drive back
to the town, for the purpose of sending you my despatch.  As I passed
up the road the balls and shells from the enemy began to fall with
more than usual rapidity.  I did not see the point from which they
came; but, meeting Captain Ayres, he said he was about to bring up his
battery, supported by the Ohio Brigade, under General Schenck, to
repel a rumoured attempt of cavalry to outflank this column.  As I
went forward he passed down.  General Schenck's brigade was at once
drawn up across the road, and Captain Ayres' guns were planted in a
knoll at the left, when a powerful body of rebels, with a heavy
battery, came down from the direction of Bull's Run, and engaged this
force with tremendous effect.  I went to Centreville, sent off my
despatch, and started with all speed to return-intending to go with
our troops upon what had been the hotly-contested field, never
doubting for a moment that it would remain in their hands.  I had gone
but a quarter of a mile when we met a great number of fugitives, and
our carriage soon became entangled in a mass of baggage-waggons, the
officer in charge of which told me it was useless to go in that
direction, as our troops were retreating.  Not crediting the story,
which was utterly inconsistent with what I had seen but a little while
before, I continued to push on.  I soon met Quartermaster Stetson, of
the Fire Zouaves, who told me, bursting into tears, that his regiment
had been utterly cut to pieces, that the Colonel and
Lieutenant-Colonel were both killed, and that our troops had actually
been repulsed.  I still tried to proceed, but the advancing columns
rendered it impossible, and I turned about.  Leaving my carriage, I
went to a high point of ground and saw, by the dense cloud of dust
which rose over each of the three roads by which the three columns of
the army had advanced, that they were all on the retreat.  Sharp
discharges of cannon in their rear indicated that they were being
pursued.  I waited half an hour or so to observe the troops and
batteries as they arrived, and then started for Washington to send my
despatch and write this letter.  As I came past the hill on which the
Secessionists had their intrenchments less than a week ago I saw our
forces taking up positions for a defence if they should be
assailed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE RETREAT.</p>

<p>The Times of Tuesday contains an account of the retreat of the
Federal forces from Bull's Run by its Special Correspondent.
Mr. Russell started, with another English gentleman, for the scene of
action early on Sunday morning, the 21st of July, in a small carriage,
with a led horse behind to provide for emergencies.  Having got to a
hill which commanded a partial view of the battle-field they were
giving their horses a brief rest before pushing on to the front.  Here
they were joined by the Special Artist of this Journal.  The remainder
of the narrative, as far as we can afford space for it, we give in
Mr. Russell's own words:-</p>

<p><quote>In the midst of our little reconnaissance Mr. Vizetelly, who has been
living and, indeed, marching with one of the regiments as artist of
the ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS, came up and told us the action had been
commenced in splendid style by the Federalists, who had advanced
steadily, driving the Confederates before them-a part of them, as I
firmly believe, to bring them under the range of their guns.  He
believed the advantages on the Federalist side were decided, though
won with hard fighting, and he had just come up to Centreville to look
after something to eat and drink, and to procure little necessaries,
in case of need, for his comrades.  His walk, very probably, saved his
life.  Having seen all that could be discerned through our glasses, my
friend and myself had made a feast on our sandwiches in the shade of
the buggy; my horse was eating and resting, and I was forced to give
him half an hour or more before I mounted, and meantime tried to make
out the plan of battle, but all was obscure and dark.  Suddenly up
rode an officer, with a crowd of soldiers after him, from the village.
"We've whipped them on all points!" he shouted, "We've taken their
batteries, and they're all retreating!"  Such an uproar as followed.
The spectators and the men cheered again and again, amid cries of
"Bravo!"  "Bully for us!"  "Didn't I tell you so?" and guttural
"hochs" from the Deutschland folk and loud "hurroos" from the Irish.
Soon afterwards my horse was brought up to the hill, and my friend and
the gentlemen I have already mentioned set out to walk towards the
front-the latter to rejoin his regiment if possible, the former to get
a closer view of the proceedings.  As I turned down into the narrow
road or lane, already mentioned, there was a forward movement among
the four-wheeled tilt-waggons, which raised a good deal of dust.  My
attention was particularly called to this by the occurrence of a few
minutes afterwards.  I had met my friends on the road, and after a few
words rode forward at a long trot as well as I could past the waggons
and through the dust, when suddenly there arose a tumult in front of
me at a small bridge across the road, and then I perceived the drivers
of a set of waggons with the horses turned towards me, who were
endeavouring to force their way against the stream of vehicles setting
in the other direction.  By the side of the new set of waggons there
were a number of commissariat men and soldiers, whom at first sight I
took to be the baggage guard.  They looked excited and alarmed, and
were running by the side of the horses-in front the dust quite
obscured the view.  At the bridge the currents met in wild disorder.
"Turn back!  Retreat!" shouted the men from the front.  "We're
whipped, we're whipped!"  They cursed and tugged at the horses' heads,
and struggled with frenzy to get past.  Running by me on foot was a
man with the shoulder-straps of an officer.  "Pray what is the matter,
Sir?"  "It means we're pretty badly whipped, and that's a fact," he
blurted out in puffs, and continued his career.  I observed that he
carried no sword.  The teamsters of the advancing waggons now caught
up the cry.  "Turn back-turn your horses!" was the shout up the whole
line, and, backing, plunging, rearing, and kicking, the horses which
had been proceeding down the road reversed front and went off towards
Centreville.  Those behind them went madly rushing on, the drivers
being quite indifferent whether glory or disgrace led the way,
provided they could find it.  In the midst of this extraordinary
spectacle an officer, escorted by some dragoons, rode through the ruck
with a light cart in charge.  Another officer on foot, with his sword
under his arm, ran up against me.  "What is all this about?"  "Why,
we're pretty badly whipped!  We're all in retreat!  There's General
Tyler there badly wounded!"  And on he ran.  There came yet another,
who said, "We're beaten on all points!  The whole army is in retreat!"
Still there was no flight of troops, no retreat of an army, no reason
for all this precipitation.  True, there were many men in uniform
flying towards the rear, but it did not appear as if they were beyond
the proportions of a large baggage escort.  I got my horse up into the
field out of the road, and went on rapidly towards the front.  Soon I
met soldiers who were coming through the corn, mostly without arms;
and presently I saw firelocks, cooking-tins, knapsacks, and
great-coats on the ground, and observed that the confusion and speed
of the baggage-carts became greater, and that many of them were
crowded with men, or were followed by others who clung to them.  The
ambulances were crowded with soldiers, but it did not look as if there
were many wounded.  Negro servants on led horses dashed frantically
past; men in uniform whom it were a disgrace to the profession of arms
to call "soldiers" swarmed by on mules, chargers, and even draught
horses, which had been cut out of carts or waggons, and went on with
harness clinging to their heels, as frightened as their riders.  Men
literally screamed with rage and fright when their way was blocked up.
On I rode, asking all "What is all this about?" and now and then, but
rarely, receiving the answer, "We're whipped!" or "We're repulsed!"
Faces black and dusty, tongues out in the heat, eyes staring-it was a
most wonderful sight. . . .. The road was now literally covered with
baggage.  It seemed to me as if the men inside were throwing the
things our purposely.  "Stop!" cried I to the driver of one of the
carts, "everything is falling out."  "- you!" shouted a fellow inside,
<pb n="144"/> "if you stop him I'll blow your
brains out."  My attempts to save Uncle Sam's property were then and
there discontinued. . . . What occurred at the hill I cannot say, but
all the road from Centreville for miles presented such a sight as can
only be witnessed in the track of the runaways of an utterly
demoralised army.  Drivers flogged, lashed, spurred, and beat their
horses, or leaped down and abandoned their teams, and ran by the side
of the road; mounted men, servants, and men in uniform, vehicles of
all sorts, commissariat-waggons thronged the narrow ways.  At every
shot a convulsion, as it were, seized upon the morbid mass of bone,
sinew, wood, and iron, and thrilled through it, giving new energy and
action to its desperate efforts to get free from itself.  Again the
cry of "Cavalry!" arose.  "What are you afraid of?" said I to a man
who was running beside me.  "I'm not afraid of you," replied the
ruffian, levelling his piece at me and pulling the trigger.  It was
not loaded or the cap was not on, for the gun did not go off.  I was
unarmed, and I did go off as fast as I could, resolved to keep my own
counsel for the second time that day.  And so the fight went on.  At
one time a whole mass of infantry, with fixed bayonets, ran down the
bank of the road, and some, falling as they ran, must have killed and
wounded those among whom they fell.  As I knew the road would soon
become impassable or blocked up, I put my horse to a gallop and passed
on towards the front.  But mounted men still rode faster, shouting
out, "Cavalry are coming!"  Again I ventured to speak to some officers
whom I overtook, and said, "If these runaways are not stopped the
whole of the posts and pickets into Washington will fly also!"  One of
them, without saying a word, spurred his horse and dashed on in front.
I do not know whether he ordered the movement or not, but the van of
the fugitives was now suddenly checked, and, pressing on through the
wood at the roadside, I saw a regiment of infantry blocking up the
way, with their front towards Centreville.  A musket was levelled at
my head as I pushed to the front:-"Stop, or I'll fire!"  At the same
time the officers were shouting out, "Don't let a soul pass!"  I
addressed one of them, and said, "Sir, I am a British subject.  I am
not, I assure you, running away.  I have done my best to stop this
disgraceful rout (as I had), and have been telling them there are no
cavalry within miles of them."  "I can't let you pass, Sir!"  I
bethought me of General Scott's pass.  The Adjutant read it, and the
word was given along the line,  "Let that man pass!" and so I rode
through, uncertain if I could now gain the Long-bridge in time to pass
over without the counters gn [sic].  It was about this time I met a
cart by the roadside surrounded by a group of soldiers, some of whom
had "69" on their caps.  The owner, as I took him to be, was in great
distress, and cried out as I passed, "Can you tell me, Sir, where the
69th are?  These men say they are cut to pieces."  "I can't tell you."
"I'm in charge of the mails, Sir, and I will deliver them if I die for
it.  You are a gentleman, and I can depend on your word.  Is it safe
for me to go on?"  Not knowing the extent of the d&eacute;bcle, I
assured him it was, and asked the men of the regiment how they
happened to be there?  "Shure, the Colonel himself told us to go off
every man on his own hook, and to fly for our lives," replied one of
them. . . . After sunset the moon rose, and amid other acquaintances I
jogged alongside an officer who was in charge of Colonel Hunter, the
commander of a brigade, I believe, who was shot through the neck, and
was inside a cart, escorted by a few troopers.  This officer was, as I
understood, the Major, or second in command of Colonel Hunter's
regiment, yet he had considered it right to take charge of his chief,
and leave his battalion.  He said they had driven back the enemy with
ease, but had not been supported, and blamed-as bad officers and good
ones will do-the conduct of the General: "So mean a fight I never
saw." . . . As I approached Washington, having left the Colonel and
his escort at some seven miles on the south side of the Long-bridge, I
found the grand guards, pickets' posts, and individual sentries
burning for news, and the word used to pass along "What does that man
say, Jack?"  "Begorra, he tells me we're not het at all-only
retraiting to the ould lines for convaniency of fighting to-morrow
again.  Oh, that's illigant!"  On getting to the t&eacute;te du pont,
however, the countersign was demanded.  Of course I had not got it.
But the officer passed me through on the production of General Scott's
safeguard.  The lights of the city were in sight, and reflected on the
waters of the Potomac, just glistened by the clouded moon, shone the
gay lamps of the White House, where the President was probably
entertaining some friends.  In silence I passed over the Long-bridge.
Some few hours later it quivered under the steps of a rabble of
unarmed men.  At the Washington end a regiment with piled arms were
waiting to cross over into Virginia, singing and cheering.  Before the
morning they received orders, I believe, to assist in keeping Maryland
quiet.  For the hundredth time I repeated the cautious account, which
to the best of my knowledge was true.  There were men, women, and
soldiers to hear it.  The clocks had just struck eleven p.m. as I
passed Willard's.  The pavement in front of the hall was crowded.  The
rumours of defeat had come in, but few of the many who had been fed
upon lies and the reports of complete victory which prevailed could
credit the intelligence.  Seven hours had not elapsed before the
streets told the story.  The "Grand Army of the North," as it was
called, had representatives in every thoroughfare, without arms,
orders, or officers, standing out in the drenching rain.  When all
these most unaccountable phenomena were occurring I was fast asleep;
but I could scarce credit my informant in the morning, when he told me
that the Federalists, utterly routed, had fallen back upon Arlington
to defend the capital, leaving nearly five batteries of artillery,
8000 mu[s]kets, immense quantity of stores and baggage, and their
wounded and prisoners in the hands of the enemy!  Let the American
journals tell the story their own way.  I have told mine as I know
it. . . . There is much talk now (of "masked batteries," of course) of
outflanking, and cavalry, and such matters.  The truth seems to be
that the men were overworked, kept out for twelve or fourteen hours in
the sun exposed to long-range fire, badly officered, and of deficient
regimental organisation.  Then came a most difficult operation-to
withdraw this army, so constituted, out of action in face of an
energetic enemy who had repulsed it.  The retirement of the baggage,
which was without adequate guards, and was in the hands of ignorant
drivers, was misunderstood and created alarm, and that alarm became a
panic, which became frantic on the appearance of the enemy, and on the
opening of their guns on the runaways. . . .  Let me, however, express
an opinion as to the affair of yesterday.  In the first place, the
repulse of the Federalists, decided as it was, might have had no
serious effects whatever beyond the mere failure-which politically was
of greater consequence than it was in a military sense-but for the
disgraceful conduct of the troops.  The retreat on their lines at
Centreville seems to have ended in a cowardly rout-a miserable,
causeless panic.  Such scandalous behavior of the part of soldiers I
should have considered impossible, as, with some experience of camps
and armies, I have never even in alarms among camp-followers seen the
like of it.  How far the disorganisation of the troops extended I know
not; but it was complete in the instance of more than one regiment.
Washington this morning (the 22nd) is crowded with solders without
officers, who have fled from Centreville, and with "three months'
men," who are going home from the face of the enemy on the expiration
of their term of enlistment.</quote></p>


<p rend="center">ESTIMATED STRENGTH OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN
ARMIES.</p>

<p>In another letter by the Times Special Correspondent, written on
the 19th ult., he estimates the effective strength of General
M'Dowell's army at 30,000 infantry, with about sixty field guns, and
ten squadrons of cavalry.  He reckons General M'Clellan's corps in
Western Virginia at 35,000 men, and General Patterson's division at
22,000.  The reserve at Washington he estimates at 16,000 men, the
troops in Maryland at 7400 men, and the corps lying at Fortress Monroe
and Hampton at 11,000.  The Southern army under General Beauregard at
Manassas Junction was, he says, estimated at 60,000 men; "but that
number must include the reserves, and a portion of the force in the
intrenchments along the road to Richmond, in the immediate
neighbourhood of which there is a corps of 15,000 men."  The rest of
the Southern army he reckons at 18,000 or 20,000 men at Norfolk, and
8000 to 9000 at Aquia Creek, besides General Johnson's corps of some
10,000 men.</p>

<p>The interest which at the beginning of the civil war in America
centred chiefly in Washington has latterly shifted from the capital on
account of the onward march of the Federal troops.  But the battle at
Bull's Run, so disastrous to their arms, and the flight consequent
thereon, make it a question whether Washington itself will not have to
stand the brunt of an attack from the Secessionist troops, flushed by
their late victory.  Our map, therefore, of the District of Columbia,
given on the preceding page, cannot fail to be of interest at the
present juncture.  The western and south-eastern boundaries of
Washington are formed by the main and eastern branches of the River
Potomac.  It is situated upon a plain, rising into gentle eminences
here and there, and fringed by a distant range of hills.  The streets
point directly to the four quarters of the compass, and are diagonally
intersected by spacious avenues, which converge from every direction
upon Capitol hill as a focus.  The northern and western boundary of
the city is an undulating plain, upon the verge of which the blue
hills of Montgomery county, Maryland, are distinctly visible.  Toward
the north-east the topographical features present nothing of more
efficient aid to defensive operations than a succession of slopes and
undulations.  At the western verge of the city the ground rises almost
abruptly, affording an excellent site for a battery, whose guns or
mortars could sweep half the horizon.  Upon the spit of land jutting
into the main branch of the Potomac stands the half-finished
Washington monument.  Around it is a span of many acres, commanding
the western bank of the river, the bridge of the Washington and
Alexandria Railroad, the only approach to the city from that
direction.  Along the south-west boundary of the city lie three
commanding elevations, which, occupied with men and artillery, would
render the approach of a storming force from any point of the compass
a matter of great difficulty.  All that part of the town having a land
boundary is inclosed by similar elevations, rendering it quite
possible to surround the city with batteries, advantageously planted,
commanding the entire plain.  The northern boundary of the city is the
one from which assault is most to be apprehended.  The rivers which
protect it on the west and south-west form an impregnable barrier,
and, guarded as they are, a land attack from either of those
directions need not be feared.  Seven miles above the city, at a place
called Little Falls, the fordage of the Potomac is regarded as
practicable, unless the east bank is well protected.  The approach to
the city in that direction would bring a storming force within range
of a row of batteries commanding the northern limit of the city.  The
openness of the surrounding plain leaves such a storming party but
little chance of effective strategic operations.  The assailants would
encounter first the fires of the batteries, and next a hand-to-hand
conflict with the forces behind them.</p>

<p>Respecting the apprehended danger of the capital the New York
Herald of the 23rd says:-</p>

<p><quote>The danger which now menaces Washington is positive and formidable,
and all the troops from all quarters that can be spared for the
capital of our country should be sent forward at once.  The army, too,
should instantly be supplied with educated officers to the fullest
possible extent, and Mr. Lincoln should lose no time in strengthening
the weak places of his Cabinet.  We had hoped that this war would be
finished in a short triumphal Union campaign.  We were mistaken.  But
we have been misled by the misplaced confidence of our Government in
the strength of its army, and by the fatal delusion of the army itself
in regard to the retreating stratagems of the enemy.  The war now
ceases to be an uninterrupted onward march of our forces southward.
The Government, in a single day, and at the capital of the nation, is
thrown upon the defensive, and under circumstances demanding the most
prompt and generous efforts to strengthen our forces at that point.
Every other question, all other issues, and all other business, among
all parties and all classes of our loyal people, should be now made
subordinate to the paramount object of securing Washington.  The loyal
States within three days may dispatch 20,000 men to that point; and if
we hold the capital for twenty days we may have by that time an army
of 200,000 men intrenched around it.  Action, action, action!  Let our
Governor and State and city authorities, and the State and city
authorities of every loyal State, come at once to the rescua [sic],
and move forward their reinforcement, without waiting for instructions
from Washington.</quote></p>

<p rend="center">SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND THE SECESSIONIST TROOPS
ON THE UPPER POTOMAC.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in America, writing from the Federal Camp, on
the 7th ult., says he managed to pay a flying visit to Patterson's
division at Martinsburg, getting up in time to witness his gallant and
successful dash at the Confederate troops, on the 2nd ult., at
Hainsville on the Upper Potomac.  In reference to this brisk encounter
he has forwarded a Sketch (engraved on page 143) showing the advance
of the Wisconsin men through the wheatfields, after fording the river,
to attack the enemy's position.  Their behaviour (he says),
considering it was the first time they were under fire, was admirable;
they went on very steadily, poured in two or three volleys, and then,
making a rush with bowie-knife and revolver, sent the Disunionists
flying towards Winchester, leaving behind them many dead, wounded, and
prisoners.  The building burning in the distance is a barn in which a
strong body of the enemy had intrenched themselves, and near which
they had planted some guns.  A few shells sent into it by the Federal
artillery soon dislodged them, and completed the discomfiture of their
already wavering troops.</p>

<head>MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT DAVIS.</head>

  </bibl>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Confederate Congress has assembled at Richmond, and a telegram
from that place, received in the Northern State vi&acirc; New Orleans, gives
the following summary of President Davis's Message:-</p>

<p>Mr. Davis states that his Inaugural called attention to the causes
which formed the Confederacy, and that it is now only necessary to
call attention to such facts as have occurred during the recess, and
to matters connected with the public defence.  He congratulates
Congress on the accession to the Confederacy of other equal Sovereign
States.  It was deemed advisable to remove the archives of the several
departments to Richmond, to which place Congress had already removed
the seat of Government.</p>

<p>The aggressive movements of the enemy have induced prompt and
energetic action.  The accumulation of the enemy's forces on the
Potomac has sufficiently demonstrated that his efforts are directed
against Virginia, and from no point could the necessary measures for
her protection be so efficiently directed as from our capital.  The
rapid progress of the last few months has stripped the veil behind
which the true policy and purposes of Mr. Lincoln's Government had
been previously concealed, and they were now fully revealed.</p>

<p>The Message of their President, the action of their Congress during
its present Session, confess the intention  of subjugating the seceded
States by war, a folly which is only equalled by its wickedness-a war
by which it is impossible to attain the proposed result.  Whilst its
dire calamities cannot be avoided by us, they will fall with redoubled
severity on themselves.</p>

<p>Commencing in March last with an affectation of ignorance of the
secession of the seven States which organised the Confederate
Government, persisting in April in absurd assumptions of the existence
of a riot which was to be dispersed by posse comitatus, continuing in
successive months false representations that the States intended
offensive war in spite of conclusive evidence to the contrary,
furnished as well by official action as by the basis of the
Constitution, the President of the United States succeeded in deluding
the people of those States into the belief that the purpose of this
Government was not peace at home, but conquest abroad; not the defence
of their liberties, but the subjugation of the people of the United
States.</p>

<p>The series of manoeuvres by which the impression was created, the
acts by which they were devised, and the perfidy by which they were
executed, are already known.  Could it be supposed they would make
openly their success a subject of boast and self-laudation in the
Executive Message?</p>

<p>Fortunately for truth, Mr. Lincoln's Message minutely details the
attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter in violation of the armistice of
which he confesses to have been informed only by rumour too vague and
uncertain to create any attention.  Hostile attempts to supply Fort
Sumter are admitted to have been undertaken with a knowledge that
their success was impossible.  The sending a notice to the Governor of
South Carolina of the intended ruse for the accomplishment of this
object, and quoting from the Inaugural that there would be no conflict
unless these States were the aggressors, and proceeding to declare
that his conduct, as in the past will be for the future, was in the
performance of this promise, which could not be misunderstood.  In
defiance of our statement that he gave notice of the approach of a
hostile fleet, he charges these States with being the assailants of
the Union.  The world cannot misunderstand this unfounded
pretence.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln expresses concern that some foreign nations have so
shaped their action as if they supposed the early destruction of the
Union probable.  He abandons further disguise, and proposes to make
the contest short and decisive, and confesses that even an increased
force is demanded.  These enormous preparations are a distinct avowal
that the United States are engaged in a conflict with a great and
powerful nation, and are compelled to abandon the pretence of
dispersing rioters and suppressing insurrection, and are driven to the
acknowledgment that the Union is dissolved.  They recognise the
separate existence of the Confederate States by indirection, by
embargo, and blockade, by which all communication between the two is
cut off.  They repudiate the foolish idea that the inhabitants of the
Confederacy are still citizens of the United States, for they are now
waging an indiscriminate war upon them with a savage ferocity unknown
to modern civilisation.  Mr. Davis then compares the present invasion
to that of Great Britain in 1781, but which was conducted in a more
civilised manner.  Mankind will shudder at the outrages committed on
defenceless females by those pretending to be our fellow-citizens.
Who will depict the horror with which they will regard the deliberate
malignity which, under pretext of suppressing an insurrection, makes
special war upon sick women and children by carefully-devised measures
to prevent their obtaining medicines necessary to their cure?  The
sacred claims of humanity, respected by all nations, even in the fury
of battle, by careful deviation of attack from hospitals, are now
outraged by the Government which pretends a desire to continue a
fraternal connection.  Such outrages admit of no retaliation unless
the actual perpetrators are required.  Taylor's mission to Washington
was to propose an exchange  of prisoners taken on the privateer
Savannah, and to inform Mr. Lincoln that we are determined to check
all barbarities on prisoners of war by such retaliation as will
effectually put an end to such practices.  Mr. Lincoln's promised
reply has not yet been received.  Reference is made to the peculiar
position existing between the Confederate Government and the States,
usually termed Border Slave States, which, the Message says, cannot be
properly withheld from notice.  Our people are animated by the
sentiments towards the inhabitants of those States which found
expression in your enactment refusing to consider them enemies or to
authorise hostilities against them.  That a large portion of those
States regard us as brethern, and, if unrestrained by the actual
presence of large armies, the subversion of the civil authority and
declaration of martial law, would, some of them at least, joyfully
unite with us.  But that they are with almost entire unanimity opposed
to the prosecution of the war waged against us is a fact of which
daily-recurring events warrant the assertion.  The President of the
United States, in refusing to recognise the right of those of our late
sister States refraining from an attack upon us, justifies his refusal
by the assertion that the States have no other power than that
reserved to them in the Union by the Constitution.  This new
constitutional relation between the States and the general Government
is a fitting introduction to another assertion of the Message-that the
Executive possesses the power of suspending the writ of habeas corpus
and of delegating that power to military commanders at discretion.
Both these positions claim respect equal to that which is felt for an
additional statement of opinion in the same paper, that it is proper,
in order to execute the laws, that the single law made to meet the
extreme tenderness of citizens for liberty, that practically it
relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very
limited extent be violated.  We may well rejoice that we have for ever
severed our connection with a Government that thus tramples upon all
principles of constitutional liberty, and with a people in whose
presence such avowals could be paraded.</p>

<p>  Our operations in the field were greatly extended by reason of
this policy, which, heretofore secretly entertained, is now avowed and
acted upon by the United States.  The forces hitherto raised have
proved ample for the defence of the States which originally organised
the Confederacy.  With the exception of these fortified islands, whose
defence is effectively aided by a preponderation of naval force, the
enemy has been driven-completely driven-out of those States.  These
forces must, however, necessarily prove inadequate on account of the
invasion by half a million of men now proposed by the enemy-and a
corresponding increase of our forces now becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The Message refers to the crops, which are the most abundant in our
history.  Many believe the supply adequate to two years' consumption.
Our citizens manifest a laudable pride in upholding their independence
unaided by any resources other than their own; and the subscript ons
[sic] to the loan proposed by the Government cannot fall short of
fifty million dollars, and will probably largely exceed that sum.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Americans of the North have taken their utter rout in very good
part.  The panic which struck the "army of the Potomac" has been met
by a corresponding display of fortitude on the part of the community
at large.  Congress and the Administration have acted in a truly Roman
spirit.  The Cannae of Virginia has not caused them to despair of the
Republic.  Renewed vigour has been the only order of the day at
Washington.  Northern journalists, to their credit be it said, have
not sought to extenuate nor disguise the disgraceful facts which
accompanied the flight of the army in which they took so much pride.
Exposures worse than those of Mr. Russell are freely published in the
journals of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.  The first thought has
been, not "What will England and France say?" but "What are the causes
of this great disaster, and how shall we act so as to do better next
time?"  Consciously or unconsciously, they have emulated the spirit of
English journalists during the disasters of the first Crimean winter.
National vanity has given way before loftier considerations, and, just
as the unsparing confessions and criticisms of our newspapers paved
the way for reform and reorganisation in every branch of the service,
so the application of the same remedial agency in the United States,
when backed up by the unsubdued confidence of the people, augurs well
for the recovery of their military prestige.  Sooth to say, we like
the Northerners better under this aspect than in that late hectoring
mood when they boasted that the Southern armies would all be driven
into Texas by January next, after which Mr. Davis and all his Cabinet,
and Beauregard and his Generals, were to be hanged; while we English
were specially selected as the objects of the undying vengeance of the
victors, because, in common with the rest of Europe, we recognised the
Confederates as a belligerent power, and because, in common also with
the general current of European public opinion, and in perfect good
faith and the most friendly spirit, we ventured to argue that
peaceable separation was a better solution of the problem for all
parties than a civil war on the largest scale, of the fiercest
character and the most doubtful results. The first frost of adversity
has withered this vainglorious spirit.   The North recognises in the
South a foe formidable on her own soil; and

the anti-British rabies is so extinct among them that the tender of a
regiment of British volunteers which was made to the authorities of
the State of New York in April, and superciliously rejected, has been
graciously accepted by the Federal Government in July.  The spoiled
children of fortune need a little adversity to bring out the finer
points of their character.  The dazzling sun of a marvellous
prosperity had shed its influences upon them so long that they scarce
knew themselves, and dreamt the world was at their feet.  Now that
that era has passed away, and a destructive tornado is scattering to
the four quarters of heaven the accumulated fruits of a long peace,
the men seem more heroic than before.  The Southerners share equally
with the Northerners in this apparent increase of stature.
Sacrificing without a sigh every luxury and many of the necessaries of
life-as poorly equipped and cared for in many respects as the French
patriot armies of 1792-they rob us of our sympathies much more now
when fighting on the heights of Manassas for their national
independence, as the French fought in the same cause on the heights of
Valmy, than when their chiefs were dominant at Washington,
brow-beating and challenging every anti-slavery representative, when
enthusiastic mass meetings were presenting gold-headed canes to the
ruffian assailants of Charles Sumner, Horace Greeley, John Hickman,
and other non-duelling, anti-slavery champions, and when Palmetto
volunteers rushed to the field, not, as now, against foemen worthy of
their steel, but to burn down the towns, villages, and homesteads of
the peaceful Free-State settlers in Kansas.  The Southern chivalry
have nobler game before them now than the tarring and feathering of
defenceless individual Northerners in their midst; and the fiery
ordeal they have chosen for themselves cannot fail to give a grandeur
to their attitude which will command more respect from the onlooking
world than was ceded to them when they occupied the pride of place in
the Government of that Great Republic which need not be less truly
great because they have left it.</p>

<p>The North has at length got over one absurd and dangerous illusion
to which she had hitherto clung with a strange obstinacy-that is, that
"in every State, except, perhaps, South Carolina," there was a
majority in favour of the Union, and that all the Secessionist
movements were the result of a plot on the part of a few disappointed
politicians and intriguing theorists, in which the mass of the people
took no part.  The truth is, that except in Western Virginia and in
Eastern Tennessee, where the Stars and Stripes are still flying, the
Unionists party has no existence whatever in the seceded States.  No
one in Europe has ever shared in this illusion.  It has been evident
to us all along that the South was, with the above-named exceptions,
terribly unanimous and terribly in earnest.  But the North have fallen
into that common human failing of believing things to be as they would
desire to have them, and the consequence has been that they have had
to suffer a rude awakening.  The battle of Bull Run enabled them to
gauge the depth of Southern fanaticism in behalf of independence by
the side of their own love of empire.  The Northern troops found
themselves opposed to a regiment of coloured men who fought with no
want of zeal against them.  Louisiana has called her free negroes to
arms, and North Carolina has not disdained to enroll among her
contingent her stalwart Cherokees.  But the North, partly through
prejudice of colour, and partly through a fraternal feeling towards
the Southerners, will allow no coloured men to serve under the Stars
and Stripes.  The North stupidly prefers to enlist Caucasian
three-months' men, who coolly walk off the field of battle on the day
of the engagement because their time was up that day!  Now, when one
side conquers its prejudices and employs all possible weapons, while
the other hampers itself with restrictions, and fights with a sort of
reluctance and a fear of injuring the adversary too much, it is easy
to see that the latter fights under great disadvantages.  And this
conclusion, too, the North is beginning to take to heart.</p>

<p>The task which the North has undertaken now for the first time
appears to her in all its magnitude.  It is nothing less than to
conquer first, and afterwards hold in subjection a country as large as
Western and Central Europe, inhabited by six millions of freemen and
three and a half millions of slaves.  In addition to this the border
Slave States which still remain in the Union must be overawed and held
to their allegiance.  Never has a Democratic Republican nation, such
as the North now is, imposed upon itself such herculean labour.  It is
no disgrace but rather the glory of the North that the instruments fit
for carrying out such a policy are not readily obtainable.  Certainly
they are not to be found in Washington at present.  The grand army of
the North is pleasantly described by the New York Tribune as "a huge
picnic party," and again as a "considerable mass meeting."  The
regulars shower contempt upon the volunteers; the volunteer privates
have a profound distrust of their officers; the Commander-in-Chief
blurts out his animosity towards the Secretary of War to every chance
Congressman or editor he meets.  It is everywhere admitted that the
advance to Richmond was the idea of "General" Greeley, the editor of
the New York Tribune, which his journal was powerful enough to force
on the Cabinet, while the Cabinet forced it upon General Scott.
Mr. Moses Grinnell, a leading member of the Union Defence Committee,
and a man who has no personal ends to gain, publicly denounces the
Secretary of War, and he is followed by another gentleman of equal
social standing, who calls for the removal of the Secretary of the
Navy.  The Secretary of the Treasury, who retains more of the public
confidence than any other member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has been
unable to borrow a paltry million sterling in New York for pressing
exigencies, and has been compelled to resort to the limited money
markets of Boston and Philadelphia, which have responded  without
enthusiasm to his proposals.  And, in the rear of all, that portion of
the unemployed working classes in the large cities which has not
enlisted is beginning to assemble in mass meetings, and declare their
adhesion to the socialist idea that every man has an abstract right
for himself and family to be fed at the public crib of the city or
State.  The Southerners have always said that to this complexion the
starving working classes of the North must come at last in the event
of the prolongation of the war.  This evil has not reached any
magnitude as yet, but it is an ugly sign at the very beginning of a
war, and lends a sinister meaning to the expostulations of the most
earnest organs of the war party that the war must be short and
decisive, as the industrial classes will not, and cannot, bear the
stress of a long period of public commotion.</p>

<p>Very much, then, has to be done, and we are told in the same breath
that very little time will be allowed for doing it.  It would be well
if the weak points (for aggressive purposes) of the volunteer army
were confined to incompetent officers.  We need not dwell on those
droll pictures of "Colonels" painted with such admirable candour by
the American journals for the use of some future epic poet or as
matter for some sequel to the witty "Biglow Papers"-how one Colonel,
riding well up in the van to Washington, confessed his entire
ignorance of the whereabouts and fate of his regiment; how another,
sent with despatches from General Scott to General M'Dowell, then in
the thick of the fight, refused to deliver them, pleading that, if
General Scott wanted his head shot off, he might go and deliver them
himself; of a third who relieved himself of his overwhelming doubts
and difficulties on the morning of the battle by the happy expedient
of getting dead drunk.  All this is about to be remedied by the
establishment of a Board of Examiners; but there are other things not
so easily mended.  What are we to think of fifteen out of seventeen
Pennsylvania three months' regiments refusing to stay with General
Patterson one hour beyond their stipulated time when he was in
dangerous proximity to General Johnston's army?  What of the two
Pennsylvania regiments, one of which Mr. Russell met retiring from the
field because their time was up and the other of which marched,
indeed, to the field of battle, but refused to participate in a charge
after twelve o'clock for a similar reason?  Can anything great be
achieved with such material?  While the old militia regiments of New
York city highly distinguished themselves there were others of the
recently enlisted in that city which evidently had no heart in the
work before them.  The New York 12th ran away twice in the slight
skirmish of Thursday which preceded the grand attack of Sunday;
another New York regiment so much exaggerated the practice of falling
flat on their faces before a discharge of artillery that it was found
impossible to keep them on their legs, their propensity to fall on
their knees when a musket was discharged being irresistible.  It is
not difficult to account for this.  Many of the recruits from New York
city care not a jot for the integrity of the Union, but have enlisted
to escape from starvation.  The Pennsylvania regiments, too, have many
of them a strong pro-slavery bias, and would probably prefer defending
the line of the Potomac to advancing upon Richmond on political as
well as military considerations.  It is otherwise with the New England
troops.  These men fight for an "idea;" they have a profound dislike
both of slavery and slaveowners, and would gladly see this war made
one of liberation to the slaves.  No wonder that they fought with
spirit.  The 69th (Irish), the 79th (Highlanders), and the three
German regiments including the Garibaldi Guard (who covered the
retreat and did not flee), doubtless deserve the praise they have
received.  But the true metal is sadly alloyed by the dross which is
intermingled with it, and which must immensely detract from the value
of the whole.</p>

<p>What, then, are the prospects of the war being "short and decisive"
in favour of the North?  A number of new and raw regiments are only
now pouring into Washington.  These and others must be hardened into
an army.  General Scott loudly declares that they must be practised in
tactical movements, in large "camps of instruction," before they will
be fit for the arduous duty of crushing out the revolution.  But this
long course of professional training is just that against which the
American naturally recalcitrates.  This is why he has swept away the
system of apprenticeship in all departments of industry.  If the
American volunteer overcomes his objection to regular training in this
instance, it will be a grand proof of his devotion to the cause for
which he is fighting.</p>

<p>The logic of this expos&eacute; leads whither, if not to the
conclusion that the chances are greatly against the North achieving a
permanent success in her present line of policy?  Now that she is no
longer self-blinded by illusions, she is beginning to perceive this,
and her awakened intellect is thrown back on this dilemma-emancipation
of the slaves or recognition of the Secession.  The mind of New
England is ripe or the reception of the former idea, but the people
and politicians of the Middle and Western States are not yet prepared
to follow the leadership of Messrs. Lloyd Garrison, and Wendell
Phillips.  If anything could sting the men of New York to stifle their
scruples on this matter it would be the stories which, whether true or
false, are firmly believed at the North, of the bayoneting and
mutilating the wounded, firing the hospitals, and shelling the
ambulances by the Confederates.  Messrs. Davis and Beauregard cannot
fail to know that these cruelties are as impolitic as inhuman.  Half
the people and more than half the army of the North are as little
infected with what the Southerns call the damnable heresy of
"negro-worship" as they are themselves, and regard the arming of the
slaves with positive aversion and as not consistent with the
honourable warfare.   This sentiment is a great protection to the
South, and nothing will so soon dispel it as a disregard of the laws
of civilised warfare by the South herself.  By pursuing a strictly
defensive strategy, and by twice abstaining from an attack on
Washington when he had power to make it with a good prospect of
success, Mr. Davis is disposing Northern Conservatives to give him
credit for moderation, and to believe in the sincerity of his
oft-professed desire for peace.  All that is gained by this prudent
policy will be lost in the storm of revengeful passions aroused by the
atrocities of the Confederate soldiery.  From the number of
well-cared-for wounded prisoners at Richmond it is evident that the
barbarities (so circumstantially narrated in Northern journals and
authenticated by the testimony of well-known army surgeons) were,
happily, only partial; but the Southern leaders may rest assured that
the public opinion of the civilised world only waits fuller
confirmation to visit the excesses of a portion of their victorious
army with the same stern and one-voiced reprobation which it meted out
to the Russians after Inkerman.  In the meantime, if it should turn
out that the political institutions and social and economic conditions
of Northern civilisation present almost insuperable difficulties to
the prosecution of a great aggressive war, this fact will not tell
against them among their admirers in Europe.  If there is anything
which makes the democracy of the North a less kindly soil than the
democracy of France for the development of a Napoleon I, and the
establishment of a Napoleonic system, so much the better for their own
domestic liberties, for the cause of peace on the Western Continent,
and of Republicanism throughout the world.</p>

<p>By the Montreal Company's steamer North American we have telegrams
to the evening of the 3rd inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TWO ARMIES.</p>

<p>The Confederate army has advanced its pickets to its old positions
to the north of Fairfax Court House.  It is reported that they are
fortifying Fairfax.  The Northern army "of the Potomac" keeps within
its intrenchments on the south side of the Potomac, and is undergoing
the process of reoganisation, under the vigorous superintendence of
General M'Clellan, who is invested with all the powers of
Commander-in-Chief within the military department of Columbia.  The
three-months regiments have gone or are going home, and are replaced
by the volunteers for three years.  General M'Clellan has issued an
order commanding the instant return to their several camps of the
officers and soldiers scattered round Washington at hotels and
boarding-houses, and appointing a provost-marshal to carry out this
order.  The latter had already closed up the drinking-saloons in the
capital, and the drunkenness and disorderly conduct of late so rife in
the camp had begun to diminish.  The sanitary commission had presented
their first report.  It represents the personal habits of the men as
filthy in the extreme, that the camps are all undrained, and that the
sinks are in an intolerable condition.  The supply of food by the
Federal Government is excellent and varied.  The clothing of some of
the regiments furnished by the States is very poor, but that furnished
by the Federal Government is described as good as can be desired.</p>

<p rend="center">OTHER MILITARY MOVEMENTS.</p>

<p>The army of the Upper Potomac, under the command of General Banks,
has retired into Maryland, as Mr. Banks judged Harper's Ferry to be
untenable.</p>

<p>General Butler, stationed at Fort Monrose [sic], fearing an attack,
has evacuated Hampton, burning that village on his retreat.</p>

<p>The report of the defeat of the Confederate army in Western
Virginia, near Clarksburg, was unfounded; but General Wise when last
heard of was in full retreat, throwing logs of trees athwart the roads
to impede the pursuit of General Rosencrantz at the head of the Union
forces.</p>

<p>In Missouri there have been some minor engagements, resulting to
the advantage of the Unionists.  General Pillow, commanding the
Confederates at Memphis, has issued a proclamation stating that he
will bring 20,000 men to the aid of the Secessionists of Missouri.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LOSS AT BULL RUN.</p>

<p>An official account of this battle has not yet been published, and
perhaps never will be.  An incomplete statement of the Federal losses
makes up, killed, 280; wounded, 729; missing, 477-total, 1486.  The
Confederates acknowledge a loss in killed, wounded, and missing, of
1500 men.  The Northern wounded are being well treated in the
hospitals at Richmond.  Among the prisoners was Mr. Ely, member of
Congress, from New York.  The loss fell heavily on the officers of the
Federal army.  The killed include two colonels, one
lieutenant-colonel, two majors, sixteen captains, and seven
lieutenants; and the wounded two acting majors-general, eight
colonels, one lieutenant-colonel, three majors, sixteen captains, and
thirty-three lieutenants.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, in a telegram to his wife, announces the victory as a
"dearly bought" one.  The Congress of Richmond received the news with
great dignity.  It passed resolutions thanking Almighty God for the
result of the day, and condoling with the families of the patriots who
had fallen in defence of Southern independence.</p>

<p>Robert Toombs, of Georgia, has resigned the secretaryship of State,
while Mr. R.M.T. Hunter, late United States' senator, from Virginia,
has accepted the vacant post.  No reason is assigned for this change,
but it is probably to allow Virginia, the battle-field of the two
sections, to be represented in the Executive Department of the
Confederate Government.</p>

<p>All the cotton-factors of New Orleans, through whose hands two-
thirds of the cotton crop of America are wont to pass, have signed a
document calling upon planters to keep their cotton at home, and
pledging themselves not to sell any until the blockade is entirely
raised.</p>

<p>The New Orleans True Delta incidentally states that three-fourths
of the men who had left that city and the State (Louisiana) in defence
of Southern rights were Irishmen.</p>

<p>The Richmond Bank Convention has adjourned, after advising the
Government to issue 100,000 dollars in Treasury notes.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>Congress has passed the financial measures necessary for carrying
on the war, but not without considerable and unexpected opposition
from the Western members to the imposition of new taxes.  At one time
they succeeded in striking out the enacting clause from the Tax Bill,
but afterwards reconsidered this vote.  The loan bills, and the bill
confiscating the property of traitors and the slaves used by the enemy
in aid of the rebellion, passed with only the slight opposition which
the peace party could offer; but the tax bills ended in a double
compromise between the Eastern and Western members, and between the
Senate and the House.  The Morrill Tariff was made more protective
than before.  Tea is taxed fifteen cents (7 1/2 d.) per pound, coffee
four cents, cocoa three cents, and sugar two cents.  A tax of three
per cent is levied on all incomes above 800 dollars (£168), and a
property tax of 20,000,000 dollars assessed on all the States,
including the Seceded States.  As this tax can hardly be levied, even
in the adhering Slave States, it will yield about 11,000,000 dollars.
The telegram does not inform us if the assessed tax on watches and
carriages, and the excise tax on spirituous liquors, passed the Senate
or not.</p>

<p>A resolution looking towards a compromise was introduced into the
House of Representatives by a Democratic member from Ohio, but was
voted down by 85 to 45, all the Democrats voting in favour of the
resolution.</p>

<p>The President has replied to the Address of Congress asking him to
furnish them with the correspondence with foreign Governments
concerning the blockade and maritime rights, and also requesting the
information on which he had ordered the arrest of the Police
Commissioners of Baltimore by refusing both requests as incompatible
with due regard for the interests of the nation.  He has, however,
transmitted to the Senate a report of all the instructions given to
the Foreign Ministers of the United States in reference to the
"rebellion."</p>

<p>Congress has passed a joint resolution authorising the President to take measures to facilitate a proper representation of the United States at the International Exhibition of 1862, and appropriated the sum of 2000 dollars therefor.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>The Northern journals are full of accounts of the atrocities
committed by the Southern troops on the wounded Unionists.  The
returned regiments of three-month volunteers have been welcomed home
as if they had been victorious heroes.</p>

<p>A writ of habeas corpus taken out by the British Consul in New York
in behalf of Purcell M'Quillan, a British subject, from Charleston,
who took his passport, issued by the British Consul at Charleston, was
arrested by order of Secretary Seward and sent manacled to New York,
where he had been in military custody since June 28, had been without
effect, the military officer, with the assent of General Scott,
refusing to obey it.  The Supreme Court of the State of New York
refuses to take any further action, declining to give rise to the
scandal of a collision between the judicial and military authorities
merely in behalf of the liberty of a British subject.</p>

<p>Another important case before the New York Courts has been
postponed until October.  The crew of the privateer Savannah have not
been brought up for trial, doubtless because Mr. Lincoln fears that
their certain condemnation and execution as pirates would call forth
the retaliation on Northern prisoners of war with which Mr. Davis
threatened him.</p>

<p>The negro steward who killed three of the prize privateer crew put
on board the schooner Waring is on exhibition at Barnum's Museum, New
York, at a salary of 100 dollars per diem.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon, the Princess Clotilde, and suite arrived at New
York on the 27th ult.  No public demonstration took place.  He resided
on board the yacht, and visited the city during the day.  On the 31st
he departed for Washington, on the invitation of the President.
Princess Clotilde has engaged a suite of apartments at the New York
Hotel, where she will reside during the Prince's absence.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The Governor-General of Cuba has released the six United States
ships taken as prizes into Cienfuegos, and ordered the privateer
Sumter to go to sea.</p>

<p>The Missouri State Convention has declared vacant the seats of the
Governor and other Secessionist members of the State Government.</p>

<p>Eleven officers who served in Italy with Garibaldi have enlisted
under General Lane, of Kansas, for service in Missouri and the Far
West.</p>

<p>Although the Pacific Railroad and other works characteristic of an
era of peaceful progress have been stopped by the civil war, the daily
overland mail-coach carrying the mails between the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts is in successful operation.  The first eastward-bound
coach arrived from Sacramento at St. Joseph, Missouri, after a journey
of seventeen days and one hour.  This is the longest coach route in
the world.  The telegraphic poles and wires which are destined to join
San Francisco with New York are also being rapidly set up on the
western plains; and it is hoped that, come what may, the connection
will be complete by December of this year.</p>

<p>The Americans have invented an "elevator" for reconnoitring purposes.  It is a telescopic tube of sheet iron, raised by a windlass.  It can be elevated fifty feet in four minutes, and lowered in one minute; weighs 1700lb., and can be drawn by one horse easily.  At fifty feet troops are seen distinctly nine miles; at a hundred feet, fifteen miles.  They have also invented an indiarubber "yoke" for knapsacks, which dispenses with the straps, and is said to relieve the burden most materially.</p>

<hi rend="smallcaps">RUN BY THE 27TH AND 14TH NEW YORK REGIMENTS.</hi>
<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</p> Special Artist, who was present at the battle of Bull Run, has sent us some Sketches of the fight and the flight, two of which are engraved on the preceding page.  He writes as follows respecting the first Illustration:-"About midday the battle raged at its highest.  Two of the most gallant charges that I witnessed on the portion of the field where I had taken position, with the first-named regiment, form the subject of the accompanying Sketch.  The battery on the right was a flying one, supported by a strong body of Confederate infantry hid in the ravine and in the thicket at the top of the hill.  On the approach of the 27th Regiment they hastily retreated to the crest of the rise behind their battery, after firing a volley; and on the Federalists steadily advancing the guns were also limbered up and withdrawn from their position.  The 27th lost 27 killed and 69 wounded out of a force of 900 men.  On the right the 14th New York are rushing at an earthwork mounting position-guns, but, owing to the galling fire of the Confederate sharp-shooters in the woods and the admirable serving of the pieces in battery, were forced to retire with severe loss."</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">s</hi> regards the Stampede from Bull Run, which forms the subject of the second Illustration on the preceding page, our Special Artist thus writes:-"At half-past five the Federal troops were in full retreat, pursued at different points by the black horse cavalry of Virginia.  Retreat is a weak term to use when speaking of this disgraceful rout, for which there was no excuse.  The terror-stricken soldiers threw away their arms and accoutrements, herding along like a panic-stricken flock of sheep, with no order whatever in their flight.  Those who had been fortunate enough to get places in the baggage-waggons thrust back others with their bayonets and musket-stocks.  Wounded men were crushed under the wheels of the heavy, lumbering chariots that dashed down the road at full speed.  Light buggies, containing members of Congress, were overturned or dashed to pieces in the horrible confusion of the panic."</p>

<p>Whatever may be the condition of the crops in America, the state of the body politic renders any large cereal exportation from that country at least problematical.  No doubt efforts will be made to convert as much of its produce into money as is possible, if only for the purpose of bringing within that territory the sinews of war.  Looking at the question from this point of view, we cannot but see an additional, although a remote, cause of congratulation in the hopes of an adequate harvest in this country.  Supposing that we had to demand and to pay for in money a similar supply of corn from America this year as we had to ask in 1860, and supposing that that country was able to give us half that we asked, there would be at once a direct stimulus and sustentation afforded to that unhappy civil war which is raging.  The influence of England is felt in every country in the world, openly or silently, as the case may be; and probably nowhere is her monetary and commercial influence more felt, however little acknowledged, than in that region which we yet call, and hope still to call, the United States of America.  It will be something to be proud of if the plenty of England should indirectly contribute to the peace of America.  It would not be difficult to point out how the absence of those disturbing causes which interfere with the facile working of our political, social, and commercial arrangements, and which turn on a good or bad harvest, would operate on the tranquillity of Europe; but with that part of the subject we do not propose to deal. . . .</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICAN FRILLING</hi>.-There appeared a few months back in a literary periodical some curious particulars of the capabilities of the sewing-machine, an invention which is now so extensively employed in the world of industrial production.  We were told that amongst its multifarious applications this machine had been employed not only to sew garments of every kind, but every form of thick leather, the most delicate fabrics of the loom, the finest laces, ships' sails, and paper; even hose for draining the mines of California had passed under its operation.  One of its applications, however, was not mentioned, and this is of a kind that will especially attract the attention of the ladies.  A contrivance has been recently invented of a very simple character, which, when combined with an ordinary sewing-machine, will produce by their joint action a beautifully regular frill.  This frill can be either firmly sewed separately or at once attached to a plain band or to some part of a dress.  By the expression firmly sewed we mean a frill which cannot be drawn up and down the thread, but one of which every plait or gather is tightly held and secured.  The neatness of the work in very pleasing to the eye; and the plain band frill an be produced very cheaply.  It will probably shortly be for sale in every draper's shop in the empire.  We have lately seen some frill-making machines at work, and observed the rapidity and regularity with which the article can be produced.  The invention is, we believe, of American origin.  This is something beyond a labour-saving machine, since no similar article of manufacture has ever before been brought into the market.  Hence it has been made the subject of a patent.  All the processes are conducted by girls, and another source of employment is furnished to our female population.</p>

<p>By the steamers Anglo-Saxon and City of Baltimore we have received New York journals to the 9th and telegrams to the 10th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>
<p>There has been some fighting since our last in Western Virginia and Missouri to the advantage of the Federalists.  General Rosencrantz, in the former region, has telegraphed to Washington that the rebels had been expelled from Kanawha, and requested that the mail service may be resumed.  At Athens and at Dug Spring, nineteen miles south of Springfield, Missouri, engagements have taken place in which the Secessionists were worsted.   In the latter a body of United States' cavalry, under General Lyon, 270 strong, are said to have cut their way through a body of infantry more than ten times their number.  Eight of the former were killed and 30 wounded; while 40 of the latter were left dead on the field, and 44 wounded.</p>
<p>The coast of North Carolina, which has never been thoroughly blockaded, is swarming with privateers, who prey upon Northern commerce, and take their prizes into port without molestation.  Newbern, in this State, is a favourite rendezvous.  Land batteries are erected at several points to protect the privateer from her pursuer.  En revanche, the blockading squadron off Galveston has captured recently eleven ships belonging to the Confederates; and on the 1st inst. the United States' frigate St. Lawrence sunk a privateer off Charleston.  The privateer, mistaking the ship-of-war for a merchantman, ran out of Charleston harbour, and fired into her.  The St. Lawrence returned a broadside with the above result.  Five of the crew were drowned, and the remaining thirty-six have been sent to Fort Mifflin, below Philadelphia.</p>

<p rend="center">ARMY NEWS.</p>
<p>The "grand army of the Potomac," the army of the Upper Potomac, and the garrison in and around Fort Monroe are inactive for the present, General M'Clellan has cautioned the journals and their correspondents to say nothing of his movements, a caution which the prudence and patriotism of the editors alike incline them to obey.  From Mr. Russell's letters we learn that the new three-year volunteers "are not equal to the departed three-months men, and the camps are certainly not as well filled."  From other sources we are informed that the young commander, who inspires the greatest confidence, is brigading the newly-arrived regiments.</p>
<p>General Butler, at Fort Monroe, reports that he is in possession of 900 negroes-men, women, and children; and writes to the Secretary for War to know what he is to do with them, advising, at the same time, that they be liberated.  The reply of Secretary Cameron has not yet appeared.</p>

<p rend="center">BULL RUN.</p>
<p>Full Southern accounts of the battle of Bull Run inform us that Jefferson Davis did not arrive on the field of battle until after the day was won, and that it was the arrival of General Kirby Smith with 4000 fresh troops belonging to Johnston's army which decided the fortunes of the day.  Not more than half of Johnson's division effected their junction with Beauregard in season to take part in the fight.  An engine-driver bringing up troops from Richmond purposely ran the train off the track and delayed the arrival of the reinforcements.  He was shot after confessing his treachery to the cause he was supposed to be serving.  General Bee, of South Carolina, Colonel Bartow, of Georgia, and Colonel Johnson, of South Carolina, were slain on the Confederate side.  Colonel Wade Hampton, the richest man in the South, was seriously wounded in the cheek.</p>
<p>General M'Dowell has at last made a report of the Federal loss at Bull Run:-Killed, 19 officers and 462 men; wounded, 64 officers and 947 men; missing, 40 officers and 1176 men.  He also reports the loss of 23 pieces of artillery, 100 boxes of cartridges, 87 boxes of rifled-cannon ammunition, 30 boxes of old firearms, 13 loaded provision-waggons, 3000 bushels of oats, 2500 muskets, and 8000 knapsacks and blankets.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The Southern Congress is still in session at Richmond.</p>
<p>The Southern journals give a list of clergymen who are officers in the Confederate army.</p>
<p>It is stated that much British gold is in circulation at Richmond, which has been advanced for the new cotton crop.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>
<p>The Federal Congress adjourned on the 6th inst. until the first Monday in December.  One of its last measures was to increase the pay of the soldiers and sailors by two dollars per month.  The legislation of the late special Session is of the most important character, having accomplished a revolution in the finance of the Republic and armed the President with the prerogatives of a military despot.  Among other less striking changes is one abolishing the sub-Treasury and anti-bank policy, for which the Democratic party strove so successfully a quarter of a century ago.  The proceeds of the 250,000,000 dollar loan may remain in solvent banks until drawn out by the Government, instead of being paid immediately into the Treasury or sub-Treasury in gold and silver.</p>
<p>The assessments on gold and silver watches and pleasure-carriages were struck out of the tax bill by the Conference Committee of the two Houses.</p>
<p>The President, it is said, yielded a very reluctant assent to the Act confiscating slaves used in aid of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Members of Congress were paid their 300 dols. salary, one sixth in gold and five sixths in Treasury notes, bearing six per cent interest.  Henceforth all Government salaries will be paid in this sort of money.  These notes, payable in two years, are discounted by the brokers for 5 per cent commission.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
<p>The steamers from Europe bring frequent consignments of arms, chiefly on account of the several States.</p>
<p>Immigration has fallen off but slightly in consequence of the civil war, being at New York, the principal port, 50,000 for the first seven months of this year against 60,000 in the corresponding period of 1860.</p>
<p>The watering-places are deserted, and the hotelkeepers ruined; the prostration of business having left the Northern pleasure-seekers no money for enjoyment, and the corresponding class in the South being engaged in fighting.</p>
<p>The heat has been very great of late.  On the 4th inst. the thermometer in St. Louis marked 105 degrees in the shade, and the next day fifteen deaths from coup de soleil were  reported in the papers of that city.</p>
<p>Claflin, Mellen, and Co., the second dry-goods jobbing-house in the United States, and the owners of the finest store in Broadway, have failed, with liabilities amounting to more than _600,000.  Their receipts from the South have been entirely cut off, and those from the West very nearly so.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin and her niece had arrived at San Francisco from the Sandwich Islands,  The Irish of this city have held a meeting and resolved to send the remains of the late Irish exile, T.B. M'Manus, to Ireland by way of New York.  The funeral procession was to have taken place on the 20th instant, and the remains were to have been forwarded by the steamer sailing on the 21st.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BORDER STATES.</p>
<p>The West Virginian Convention met at Wheeling on the 6th inst., and resolved to separate from Eastern Virginia for ever.  In this they are acting in defiance of the Governments both of the United and Confederate States.  The former desires the mountaineers to maintain their connection with the rest of Virginia, in order to be able to recognise their local Government as the legal State Government.  The reasons why the latter should oppose their secession from the State are obvious.</p>
<p>The peace party at Baltimore have given a public dinner to Messrs. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Vallandingham, of Ohio, at the Eutaw House, in token of their appreciation of the courageous advocacy by these two gentlemen of the cause of peace during the late special Session of Congress.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> kith and kin on the other side of the Atlantic are beginning to graduate in their self-constructed new school-war.  It was a very pretty pageant as long as it was confined to strutting about in fantastic uniforms, winning the smiles of the New York beauties and fulminating furious tirades in newspapers.  It is quite another thing now when what might have been a substantial success, or, at the worst, a drawn game, at Bull Run, has been converted into a <hi rend="italic">stampede</hi>, in which "devil take the hindmost" seems to have been the only order of the day.  Nothing comes out clearer now than that the ill-starred attack of the Northern men was undertaken in obedience to unwarlike and inexperienced politicians, and in utter defiance of the advice of the very few men of actual military experience who have commands in their army.  A more wholesome condition of affairs has been  inaugurated by the Bull Run rout.  The three months' men are abandoning their posts in favour of volunteers who consider three years a far more reasonable allotment of time for fair drilling; and the American press generally has come to an understanding with the General, which tardily recognises the impolicy of publishing for your antagonist's benefit a daily programme of your movements and intentions, and the public of the States are universally recognising the truth and weight of the axiom so often laid down and so repeatedly laughed at by the public before the days of our volunteer corps by officers of experience, that drill-drill-drill-is essential to the formation of an efficient soldier.  Drill reduced to practice means the almost mechanical movement of the human machine in one direction or another, instantaneously consequent on the utterance of the word of command, whether by mouth or bugle.  It is in this that the Northern levies were deficient, and it was for want of this that they were routed-a good lesson to our own volunteers, which Colonel M'Murdo has not been slow to impress on them.</p>

<p>   The great point of interest on the south coast is Cape Race-the subject of Illustration-as it is the point of land which nearly all the steamers running to New York, Boston, and Portland endeavor to make.  The coast at Cape Race is bold and rocky, the cliffs rising precipitately out of the water, cracked and split asunder in many places by some great convulsion of nature; a huge black rock lifts its head up out of the deep water immediately in front of the Cape; the eternal wash of the Atlantic has worn deep hollows, and in some cases masses of rock stand out isolated from the great granite wall that breaks the ever-restless ocean that thunders against it.  On top of the cliffs, a short distance from the edge, is a well-built lighthouse painted white and striped with red vertical stripes, which distinguishes it from the lighthouse on Cape Pine, an important point of the coast, about thirty miles west of Cape Race, where the lighthouse is striped with horizontal red stripes.</p> 
<p>   Cape Race is also the terminal point eastward of that remarkable system of telegraph lines which extends throughout the whole of the United States and the British possessions.  The Americans delight in the telegraph, and use it continually for every sort of purpose, and in a way and extent that Europeans have no notion of.  From this lonely rock, standing out in the Atlantic amid fogs and storms, European news is flashed to the most distant parts of America.  From Boston to New Orleans the newspapers have it, print it, and the intelligence is old when the ship arrives at New York, three or four days after passing Cape Race.</p>
<p>   As there is no place on this iron-bound coast where ships can touch at, peculiar means must be adopted to catch the European news on its way west.  The Associated Press of America therefore employ vessels to cruise constantly in the neighbourhood of the Cape, and board the outward-bound steamships.  Having got the important intelligence, they hasten to the shore, and forward their dispatch by wires passing through Newfoundland, across the sea between it and Breten Island, and afterwards the Gut of Chanseau, through Nova Scotia, across the head of the Bay of Fundy, to the United States.</p>
<p>   This arrangement of telegraph brings Europe practically within seven days of America.  Thus the Cunard ships leaving New York on Wednesday are off Cape Race the following Sunday; being there boarded by the telegraph-boat, they receive the New York news up to that time; on the following Sunday that ship arrives at Cork harbour, Ireland, when its news is instantly forwarded to London.  And the same on the outward-bound voyages.</p>
 <p>  Since the introduction of the electric telegraph this lonely mass of storm-washed rock, whose existence was scarcely known to any one except the mariner, who sought it only that he might know his whereabout and carefully avoid it, has become as well known and its name as familiar as is that of New York or Boston.  It would be difficult to take up an American newspaper now without finding a paragraph headed "Latest News from Europe, via Cape Race."</p>
<p>   On the western side of the States the telegraph ends at the Missouri River; but, as the States on the west side of the Rocky Mountains arei [sic] as anxious for early news as the Yankees themselves, the latest intelligence from Europe, being passed through to the Missouri, is then taken up by a remarkable line of communication called the Pony Express-a line of small, fleet horses being maintained across the great plains, over the Rocky Mountains, to San Francisco.  On arrival of the telegraph from Cape Race at St. Joseph, on the Missouri, a horse starts at a gallop on its journey west.  Every twenty-five miles a fresh horse is employed to carry the telegraph message.  The journey of two thousand miles is thus accomplished in about nine days, so connecting California with England in little over a fortnight.</p>

<p>By the United States' steamer Fulton we have received New York journals of the 17th inst.<p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>
<p>The war which languishes in Virginia continues active in Southern Missouri.  On the 10th inst. General Lyon, with about 5500 Federals, well armed and provided with artillery, attacked, nine miles south-east of Springfield, a force of the enemy greatly superior in numbers, but inferior in weapons and artillery, and consisting of troops from Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and of Cherokee Indians, drove them from their intrenchments, and set fire to all their tents and baggage-waggons.  General Lyon was killed early in the fight, and the command devolved on General Siegel (a German by birth, who has seen service in Europe).  General Siegel, fearing for his communications, retreated the next day to Rolla, a station on the south-western branch of the Missouri and Pacific Railroad.  In his retreat General Siegel left behind him three guns, which he spiked and the carriages of which he destroyed.  The Federals, who at first claimed a victory, now only regard it as a drawn battle.  The loss of the Federals is set down at from 800 to half that number.  The loss of the Confederates is unknown.  Ninety prisoners were taken by the former.</p>
<p>The report of this engagement caused so much excitement among the people of St. Louis, where opinion is about equally divided  between the two parties, that General Fremont proclaimed that city in a state of siege and "effected a loan" of 250,000 dollars from the banks.</p>
<p>The inefficiency of the blockade is loudly complained of by the Northerners.  The Southern privateers are heard of everywhere on the coast of South America.  The Secretary of the Navy is chartering or purchasing vessels, and contracting for the building of gun-boats, so as to render the blockade really efficient.</p>

<p rend="center">MUTINY AND DESERTIONS.</p>
<p>The idleness of the army of the Potomac has bred a mutinous spirit.  The 79th (Highland) Regiment, the 2nd Maine Regiment, and portions of several others, have revolted, and been forced to lay down their arms.  The ringleaders are under arrest, and will be banished to the Tortugas group of islands.  Desertions are numerous.  The New York Fire Zouave Regiment has melted away and been disbanded.  The reasons given for this conduct are dissatisfaction with their officers and indisposition to serve three years.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL M'DOWELL'S REPORT ON BULL RUN.</p>
<p>This officer has at length made a report on the battle of Bull Run which is commendable for its truthful and umbombastic character.  After describing the now well-known features of this battle, and the loss in killed and wounded, he says:-</p>
<p>The return of the missing is very inaccurate, the men supposed to be missing having fallen into other regiments, and gone to Washington-many of the Zouaves to New York.</p>

<p>The causes of the defeat are stated to be the unavoidable delay in marching forward, arising from the tardy movements of the troops and the inefficient supply of ammunition and subsistence waggons.  The movement, which should have commenced on the 8th, was postponed till the 16th.  The disorder of the waggon-managers caused the delay of another day.  The troops took two days instead of one to march thirteen miles, and the regimental and division officers insisted that the troops could not do better.  These delays gave the enemy four days' notice of the attack.</p>

<p>In estimating (says the General) the force to go against Manassas I engaged not to have to do with the enemy's forces under Johnston, then kept in check by General Patterson.  This was not done, and the enemy was free to assemble from every direction in numbers only limited by the amount of his railroad rolling stock and his supply of provisions.  I could not, as I have said, more early push on faster, nor could I delay.  A large, and the best, part of my forces were three months volunteers, whose term of service was about to expire, but who were sent forward as having long enough to serve for the purpose of the expedition.  On the eve of the battle the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment of Volunteers, and the battery of Volunteer Artillery of the New York 8th Militia, whose tern of service expired, insisted on their discharge.  I wrote to the regiment, expressing a request for them to remain a short time, and the Hon. Secretary of War, who was at the time on the ground, tried to induce the battery to remain at least five days.  But in vain.  They insisted on their discharge that night.  It was granted, and the next morning, when the army moved forward into battle, these troops moved to the rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon.  In the next few days, day by day, I should have lost 10,000 of the best armed, drilled, officered, and disciplined troops in the army.  In other words, every day which added to the strength of the enemy made us weaker.</p>
<p>The object of the advance is declared to have been</p>
<p>that of getting to the railroad leading from Manassas to the Valley of Virginia, and going on it far enough to break up and destroy the communication, and interpose between the forces under Beauregard and those under Johnston; and, could we have fought a day or a few hours sooner, there is everything to show how we could have continued successful, even against the odds with which we contended.</p>
<p>The report of the Commissary-General avers that three days' provisions were served out to the divisional head-quarters on the day before the fight, but that many of the soldiers threw their knapsacks away before going into battle, while the Commissaries of some regiments neglected to send for their quotas to the divisional d&eacute;pts.  This accounts for the want of food of which the troops have since so much complained.<p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL LOAN.</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury has succeeded in negotiating 50,000,000 dollars of the national loan with the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia banks.  The former city furnishes three-fifths, Boston three-tenths, and Philadelphia one-tenth of the whole.  The banks refused to touch the 6 and 7 per cent bonds, and preferred the 7 3-10 per cent Treasury notes.  They made rather hard terms with Secretary Chase.  He agrees not to avail himself of his right to issue the 6 and 7 per cent bonds.  The interest is to run on the loan from Aug. 15, although the loan is only to be drawn from the banks by degrees and as it [is] wanted.  The 12,000,000 of Treasury notes already issued are to be accepted in part payment of the loan; so that, in fact, the banks only advance 38,000,000 dollars.  They have secured the privilege of taking 100,000,000 dollars more on the same terms as the foregoing.  On the other hand, Mr. Chase is allowed to accept tenders from the public for the national loan, and to issue Treasury notes payable on demand.  This last stipulation was only carried after considerable opposition from some of the banks.  Stocks have risen as a consequence of this negotiation, and Mr. Chase has returned to Washington.  He declared to the assembled bankers that his expenditure amounted to one million dollars a day.</p>

<p rend="center">THE STATUS OF SLAVES.</p>
<p>Secretary Cameron, in reply to the letter of General Butler, says that slaves escaping from loyal masters in the Seceded States may be detained and set to work.  "Upon the return of peace Congress will doubtless properly provide for all the persons it has received into the service of the Union, and for a just compensation to loyal masters."  But the slaves of peaceful citizens are not to be enticed away, nor is the voluntary return of any fugitive to be hindered, except where inconsistent with the public good.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENT.</p>
	  <p>Mr. Lincoln has issued proclamations for a national fast and humiliation on the last Thursday in September, and for prohibiting all intercourse between the United and Confederate States.  This, if enforced, will put a stop to the intercourse which has been hitherto maintained through the State of Kentucky.</p>

<p rend="center">PERSONAL.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon has visited the Southern army at Manassas, sleeping one night there with General Johnston.  Mr. Seward made no objection to this visit; but it was eyed unfavourably by Northern public opinion.  He reports that both armies are undisciplined, and that the result of the next battle will depend on an accident.  The Prince has returned to New York, and was about to set out on his Western tour.</p>
	  <p>Major-General Wool, the oldest officer in the United States' service next to General Scott, has been ordered to Fort Monroe to supersede</p>   [XXXIX, 208, 8/31/61]
	  <p>General Butler, a Massachusetts lawyer, in command of that post.  This appointment gives universal satisfaction.</p>
	  <p>Purcell M'Quillan, the incarcerated British subject, whom the Commander of Fort Lafayette refused to bring into court on a writ of habeas corpus, has been released by the Secretary of War in consequence of the intervention of Lord Lyons.</p>
	  <p>A Mr. Serrill, passenger to New York on board the Persia, who boasted that he had effected a loan in behalf of the Confederate States in England, was searched on his arrival in port, and £10,000 in Bank of England notes were discovered, concealed in a belt about his waist.</p>
	  <p>But the most important arrest that has yet been made is that of Mr. Faulkner, of Virginia, the late United States' Minister to France.  Mr. Faulkner went to Washington to pay the usual visit of courtesy to the Foreign Secretary, and was thereupon arrested on a charge of treason, for acts committed at Paris, in purchasing arms for the Confederates while representing the United States, and endeavouring to procure the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by the Government of France.</p>

<p>. . . We in Europe, who are, unfortunately, only too accustomed to war, watch with much interest the progress which our American kinsmen are making in the study of this noble art.  A second engagement, on nothing like the scale of the Bull Run affair, but of quite sufficient importance to earn its title of a "battle," has fully justified the Premier in saying, as he did at Dover, that there is no want of pluck among them, only of discipline.  We gladly indorse the judgment.  We all know what a dozen disciplined policemen accustomed to act in concert can effect against a wild, scrambling mob; and the "rapid movement" at Bull Run is only a new proof of the truth of the old military axiom that of undisciplined men the more you have the greater your danger.  The Springfield affair shows what sort of stuff there really is in these kinsmen of ours; and we only grieve to think what a bitter school is that in which they are learning, and how bitter for many a year to come may be the fruits of this system of education to them, to us, and to the world.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Confederate camp, referring to an engagement between 71st New York and an Alabama regiment at the battle at Bull Run, which forms the subject of our Illustration on page 226, writes as follows:-"This was the only case in which I saw two regiments positively engage each other, and these did no more than blaze away at each other at a distance of three hundred yards until both were badly cut up.  The Alabama regiment especially suffered, and when they retired they left the ground covered with their dead and wounded.  The 71st lost heavily; but they behaved exceedingly well, loading and firing as though on parade.  I think that if the bayonet had been used more freely the matter would have been sooner decided, and with less loss of life.  On the hill at the back a Confederate battery was playing on the 71st.  I was on the right of the latter regiment."</p>

<p>By the arrival of the Nova Scotiau [sic] at Londonderry, from Quebec, we have intelligence from New York to the 23rd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>There has been another panic, real or pretended, among the military authorities at Washington, caused by a rumoured intended crossing of the Potomac by the enemy below Washington, and an advance upon the capital.  It was said that there was a fleet of launches and flat boats near Acquia Creek, which were to be used in transporting Confederate troops across the river.  The Governors of ten States were telegraphed to send on immediately whatever troops they had, whether equipped, armed, or uniformed, or not, in squads or companies, as the case might be.  These messages caused great alarm in the North, and possibly stimulated the recruiting business.  The apprehended attack was, however, never made, and the transport fleet vanished into thin air.</p>
	  <p>There have been some more manifestations of an insubordinate spirit among two New York Regiments of the army of the Potomac-manifestations which were suppressed with General M'Clellan's usual vigour.</p>
	  <p>In Missouri there have been two skirmishes favourable to the Federalists.  The town of Commerce in the south-eastern portion of that State has been taken and retaken, and a Federal steamer plying on the Mississippi fired into and sunk.  General M'Culloch was not killed in the engagement of Dug Spring, as reported by the Federals.</p>
	  <p>In the territory of New Mexico the Confederates have been active; 1500 of these have compelled the surrender of Major Lynd and a regiment of Federal troops garrisoning Fort Fillmore.</p>
	  <p>The privateer Sumter, though often reported captured, was still at liberty off Laguayara, Venezuela.  The Venezuelan Government refused her admittance into port, and had sent a vessel to retake two United States' ships which the Sumter had taken.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>
<p>Commander Hickey, of H.B.M. steamer Gladiator, has complained to Commodore Stringham that the blockade is left open at four points on the coast of North Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
	  <p>The new cotton crop, about the destiny of which there is so much uneasiness in Europe, is now being picked.</p>
	  <p>A letter from a well-known South Carolinian in Virginia, dated the 12th ult., says of the condition of the army, "The supplies of clothing are not enough, and the destitution of the soldiery in clothing and food is terrible; many applications are made to us by men in health, who wish to escape sickness, for an extra pair of drawers, socks, or undershirts.  It will require every nerve to be strained by you and ourselves here to meet the exigencies of the fall and winter should the war last so long."</p>
	  <p>The Governors of several States have issued proclamations, addressed to the female part of the community, begging them to employ their time in knitting socks for the army, and calling for a subsidy of blankets.  The Charleston Courier says that the measles is sweeping through the army, and that over 3000 are ill.</p>
	  <p>Half of the colleges at the South have suspended operations, the students having enlisted for the war.</p>

<p rend="center">WESTERN VIRGINIA.</p>
	  <p>On the 20th ult. the Wheeling Convention passed an ordinance creating the new State of Kanawha by a vote of 50 to 28.  The boundary, as fixed, includes thirty-one counties of the Trans-Alleghany region of Virginia.  A provision was incorporated permitting certain adjoining counties to come in, if they desire, by the vote of a majority of their people.  The ordinance also provides for the election of delegates to a convention to form a Constitution.  On the 24th proxximo the question "For a new State" or "Against a New State" will be submitted to the popular vote.  Attorney-General Bates highly disapproves of this policy of dismembering the State of Virginia, because it countenances a policy of revolution and runs counter to the Constitutions both of the State and the nation.  The Administration desired that the loyal people of Western Virginia should continue to maintain the fiction that they were the true Government of Virginia, so that the Federal Government might seem to be fighting under the additional sanction of the State Government.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
	  <p>Secretary Seward has issued an order establishing a passport system for foreign travel.  No person will henceforth be allowed to go abroad from a port of the United States without a passport, and no one will be allowed to land in the United States without a passport from a Minister or Consul of the United States; or, if a foreigner, from his own Government, countersigned by some Minister or Consul.  This regulation is not to take effect in regard to westward-bound passengers until a reasonable time shall have elapsed for it to become known in the country from which they proceed.
Numerous petitions from the Federal prisoners at Richmond have been received by the President praying for a recognition of the Confederate Government as belligerents so far as to allow of an exchange of prisoners.  The President is, however, firmly opposed to doing any act which shall have the appearance of recognising the Confederates as other than rebels or rioters.</p>
	  <p>In order not to give ground for any retaliatory proceedings, no trial of privateers, nor any prisoners confined by the Government on charges of treason, will take place until the conclusion of the contest.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
	  <p>The Federal Government had arrested at Philadelphia Mr. Pierce Butler (the husband of Fanny Kemble), William B. Reed, the late U.S. Plenipotentiary in China, and several other prominent citizens, for holding treasonable intercourse with the enemy.</p>
	  <p> Mr. Russell's description of the flight from Bull Run had been republished in the principal Transatlantic journals.  The New York World calls it "graphic and truthful," and the organs of the better sort take it in good part, but the editorial comments of the Times on the affair are looked upon with less favour.</p>
	  <p>A persecution of the peace-party newspapers has suddenly sprung up.  In Bangor (Maine), Concord (New Hampshire), and Easton (Pennsylvania), the materiel of peace-party newspapers has been destroyed.  In Haverhill (Mass.) a peace editor has been tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail, and forced to take an oath that he would write no more articles in a spirit opposed to the war.  In New York and Brooklyn the five journals in favour of peace have been presented by the grand jury of the district as guilty of treason.  One of these journals is a Catholic organ.  The <hi rend="italic">Christian Observer</hi>, an organ of the Presbyterians, has been seized in New York for "a virulent article on the war," which means a "virulent" article in favour of peace.  The office in Philadelphia of the <hi rend="italic">New York Daily News</hi> has for similar reasons been suppressed, and the United States' Marshals in that city, on the arrival of the mail train from New York, seized every copy of this journal, including all its Southern and Western circulation.  A peace meeting has also been broken up by a mob in Saybrook, Connecticut</p>.
	  <p>The Democratic party in the United States refuses all offers of union with the Republicans, but is hopelessly divided into a war and peace section.  They seem generally to condemn the suspension by the President of the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon and suite have passed through Cleveland and Detroit en route for Lake Superior.  At the latter place the Prince was the guest of General Cass.</p>
	  <p>The £40,000 in Bank of England notes reported in our last to have been seized on the person of Mr. Serrill, a passenger to New York by the Persia, and supposed to be an agent of the Confederate Government, turn out to have been Bank post bills, of no value without Mr. Serrill's endorsement.</p>

<p rend="center">COMMERCE AND FINANCE.</p>
	  <p>The export of bread stuffs from New York to France begins to be large.</p>
	  <p>The Boston banks will only take 10,000,000 dollars instead of 15,000,000 dollars of the new loan, as at first agreed upon by the Boston deputation at New York.  The New York banks immediately assumed the subscription for the extra sum.</p>
	  <p>In the year ending June 30, 1861, California exported-of wheat, 3,533,744 bushels, and of barley and oats, 600,000 bushels more.</p>

<p>Had any one hinted some twelve months back at the possibility of the United States being the next arena for the display of the antiquated resources of martial law, suspension of habeas corpus, and the passport system, he would have been met with a shout of derisive laughter.   We have lived, however, to see these things as living, tangible facts.  They are excused and apologised for as political necessities belonging to the exigencies of the occasion.  It is amusing, however-rather sadly amusing, by the way-to see the New Country driven to avail itself of the long-despised weapons of the Old World.  Meanwhile, every one is anxiously inquiring "What next?"</p>
	  <p>The great cotton question is assuming a singular aspect.  Reports give a good crop to the Southern States; they are elevated with their military successes; and there is an idea abroad that they mean to keep, instead of trying to find, a market.  This view of the matter complicates the state of things explained by us last week.  Of what use it is for British shipping to attempt to force the so-called blockade if the Southern men will not sell when they have done so?  We venture, however, to think that the full facts are as yet but imperfectly understood in the South.  They evidently rely on their superiority in quality.  We have reason to think they are reckoning without their host.</p>

	  <p>Letters from the Red River colony, in the Hudson's Bay territory, announce the discovery of a valuable goldfield, by a party of American miners from California, in the north branch of the Saskatchewan.  Two Californian gentlemen have recently arrived at St. Paul's, Minnesota, with a considerable quantity of gold, collected by themselves, along the upper waters of the Saskatchewan, and they describe the yield and quality of the metal as promising to be quite equal to that of British Columbia, which occupies the opposite flank of the Rocky Mountains, and may therefore reasonably be inferred to be of a similar geological character, while it is known to be watered by streams which have a common origin in the same auriferous range with the northern tributaries of the Saskatchewan.</p>

	  <p>-Numerous letters confirm the great value of the oil-springs lately discovered in the United States and Canada.  The question as to the duration of their yield remains to be settled, but it seems probable that, owing to the extent of the regions in which they are found, the supply will last many years, and that a proper organisation of railway facilities will alone be needed to cause the production to be among the most important in modern commerce.  In the United States the principal deposits are understood to be close to a station on a new railway-the Atlantic and Great Western-which will render their conveyance to New York comparatively inexpensive.  In Canada they are about twelve miles from the Wyoming Station of the Great Western of Canada Railway, and some arrangements will be necessary for the transit over that distance, the existing roads being of the worst description.  At the site of the principal wells the ground was two years ago covered by an almost unbroken forest.  Now there is a resident and constantly-increasing population of upwards of five hundred.  During the last winter the coaches took an average of fifty people daily to the spot from Wyoming, and many bought land and remained.  There are several inns filled to overflowing.  Two good hotels are in course of erection.  Houses and shanties are rising on all sides, and the greatest activity is everywhere apparent.  At present there are about one hundred wells in full operation, all yielding oil.  The land is held in large blocks, the owner leasing acres and half acres for ninety-nine years.  The terms usually are 300 dollars for the privilege and one-third of the oil drawn from the wells.  The wells are sunk and cribbed to a depth of from 40 to 60 feet till the rock is reached.  In many cases surface-oil is found before reaching the rock, but it is of rather inferior quality and doubtful yield.  After arriving at the rock, the wells through the earth being from 4 to 7 feet square, they drill to a depth of from 40 to 70 feet, between which distances oil is almost sure to be discovered.  Wooden tanks, varying from 500 to 2000 gallons capacity, are constructed close to each well.  The oil is pumped into these, and afterwards drawn off into barrels to be sent to market.  A moderate average yield for all the wells now in operation (one hundred) is fifteen barrels or or 600 gallons per day.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>The most important movement of which we have received intelligence since out last is the departure of a naval expediton from Fortress Monroe, commanded by Commadore Stringham.  The squadron numbers 100 guns, and carries 4000 men, commanded by General Butler.  The only avowed object of the expedition is to block up the inlets to the outer bar of the coast of North Carolina, and thus deprive privateers of their favourite places of refuge.  But it is presumed that the unguarded Southern coast will be attacked at some point.  We shall soon hear where the blow has fallen.</p>
	  <p>In Western Virginina a slight encounter has taken place, near Summersville, in Nicholas county.  The 7th Ohio Regiment was surprised by a body of Confederates, and cut their way through with the loss of fifteen killed and forty wounded. A large number were scattered during the flight, and are missing.</p>
	  <p>In Missouri General Fremont has proclaimed martial law and emancipation to the slaves of Secessionist slaveholders.  The State rights men have captured 100,000 dollars at Lafayette, in this State.</p>

	  <p>Governor Brown, of Georgia, has issued an address to the Georgians denouncing Mr. Davis's Administration for its centralising monarchical tendencies, and warning them to cherish the main principle of the Revolution of 1861-that of State rights and a weak central authority.</p>

	  <p>There is no truth in the reports that Garibaldi proposes to help us out of our troubles.  A gentleman here, personally acquainted with Garibaldi and his son, received a letter from the latter a few days ago, in which the son says he desired himself to come out and take part in the struggle now going on here for liberty, and that his father objected, on the ground that ours was a family quarrel, and could be settled more easily without foreign interference than with it, and that it was based upon a political question in which the nations were not interested, and in the settlement of which they could not become parties.  These are now the views and sentiments of Garibaldi as expressed by his son in private correspondence of very late date.</p>

	  <p>The subscriptions for the new National Loan at the Sub-Treasury in New York amount to 1,350,000 dollars, in amounts varying from 50 dollars to 10,000 dollars each.  This does not include the large negotiations that have beeen going on between the banks and parties in various parts of the country.  The notes are not yet ready for issue.  The New York Tribune is of opinion that Englishmen will not be able to resist the temptation of 7.30 per cent interest.</p>

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA
TEXAN RANGERS (FEDERALISTS) RECONNOITRING.
SCARCELY anything more picturesque can be conceived than a troop of these rangers (as depicted on our first page) galloping wildly through the woody ravines of Virginia, between Alexandria and Fairfax, their carbines held ready for acton at a moment's notice.  To see them rattling along, draped in their loose ponchos, their stern, bearded faces shadowed by the overlapping brims of their sombreros, one might almost fancy them a troop of Cromwellian cavalry in grim pursuit of Cavaliers.

KILLING BULLOCKS IN CAMP, VIRGINIA.
The regiments encamped at a distance from Commissariat Storehouse in the Federal camp get their fresh meat distributed to them alive, a bullock being unceremoniously turned into the canvas streets for them to slaughter, cut up, and prepare as they may think fit.  The fashion of dispatching the beast (as shown at page 271) is usually as follows:-Lassos are thrown over its horns and made fast, when three or four men on each side hang on with all their strength and steady the animal's head.  Some of the best shots in the regiment are then chosen, and one advances, takes deliberate aim at the forehead, and, if successful, the poor brute rolls over dead.  Should he, however, simply wound it, those who have hold of the ropes have a rough time of it, being dragged about the field until the animal is again secured, when another marksman steps forward, and generally finishes the work.

UNION TROOPS ATTACKING CONFEDERATE PRISONERS AT WASHINGTON.
There was a general impression among the disorganised Federalist soldiers after the battle of Bull Run that their wounded had been inhumanly treated by the Confederates.  Many cases of cruelty were narrated, with much circumstantiality, in the Unionist journals.  Some of them, it is to be feared, were but too true.  Among the first to feel the consequences of the anger aroused by the recital of these deeds of cold- blooded cruelty were some wretched prisoners paraded through Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, two days after the engagement.  It was with the greatest difficulty their guard defended them from the attacks of the demoralised Union men.  This incident is depicted on the preceding page.  [Sic, following page, p. 283].

ARREST OF MR. FAULKNER AT WASHINGTON.
On the return of Mr. Faulkner from his mission at Paris he went, as is the custom in such cases, to Washington, in order to report his arrival to the Executive.  While awaiting the settlement of certain formalities he took apartments at Brown's Hotel, and it was here he was arrested.  It appears that Mr. Faulkner, a Southern man, is imbued with Southern tendencies; and it is charged against him that during his period of office in France he encouraged the Secessionist agents in every possible way, and even went so far as to purchase arms from French manufacturers for the use of the Confederate States-endeavouring also to procure the recognition of the Southern Confederacy by the French Government.  Mr. Faulkner is now lodged in close confinement at the Provost Marshal's office; and it is reported that among the documents found with his effects papers of a treasonable character have been discovered.

THE DECLINE OF THE POPULATION OF IRELAND.
That portion of the world's inhabitants among whom the English language is predominant has of late been indulging in a general census-taking.  In the summer of last year the people of the United States summed up the goodly total of thirty-one millions and a half-a decennial increase of 35 per cent.  It was their last corporate feat.  No sooner were the numbers announced than the great Republic, unable to harmonise so large a family, fell asunder. . . .
[XXXIX, 287, 9/21/61]

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .
In industrial pursuits the Irish emigrant of both sexes has thriven extraordinarily.  No European emigration has surpassed them in this respect, except the German, and that only because of the great skill both in agriculture and manufactures which the latter possess, and which the Irish lacked.  The greatest dry-goods merchant in America is a native of Ireland.  The women seem to have succeeded even better than the men.  The immense sums transmitted to their relatives in Ireland  by the servant women have attested the strong domestic affections and the large savings of Irishwomen abroad.  In the matter of education the young family of the emigrant has been taught at free unsectarian schools the elementary branches of knowledge.  On leaving school his children have enjoyed every facility for the acquisition of trades.  Political power has been his in a measure greater than he has known how to use wisely.  What American or colonial politician does not either dread, or conciliate, or swear by "the Irish vote"?  If the German emigrant is slightly superior in the industrial career, in politics he is a cipher by the side of the Irishman.  Australian and Canadian premiers, Californian and Jamaican governors, American senators, spring directly from the ranks of the Hibernian emigration.  Two United States' Presidents (Jackson and Buchanan), and more than one judge of the Supreme Court, were the sons of Irish cottiers.  To shed tears over the fate of the population that has vanished from Ireland is evidently to throw away one's sympathy on objects who do not need it.

THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.
THE Canadian steam-ship Hiberian, from Quebec, brings intelligence to the 7th inst.

BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.
The naval expedition under the command of Commodore Stringham and General Butler fell upon the forts which commanded Hatteras Inlet, on the coast of North Carolina.  The attack commenced on the morning of the 28th ult.; 300 Federals, covered by the gun-boats, were landed through a heavy surf.  All the boats were bilged in the surf, and no more men could be thrown ashore.  Two frigates, the Minnesota and Wabash, commenced shelling one of the batteries.  The shot from the battery fell short.  In three hours the Confederates evacuated the battery, and it was occupied by the 300 United States' troops on shore.  On the next day Fort Hatteras was attacked.  At five minutes past eleven a.m., an 11-inch shell having pierced the bomb-proof through a ventilator and exploded inside near the magazine, the enemy gave up the fight, and raised a white flag.  General Butler demanded an unconditional surrender.  The Confederates were commanded by Commodore Barron, late of the United States' Navy, and more recently Assistant-Secretary of the Confederate Navy.  After some demur the force, consisting of 45 officers and 665 non-commissioned officers and privates, surrendered, and have been taken to New York.  Their loss was 8 killed and 35 wounded.  On the Federal side nobody was hurt.  In the forts were captured 25 pieces of artillery, 1000 stand of arms, a large quantity of ordnance stores, provisions; three vessels laden with cotton and tobacco, and about to run the blockade; and four stands of colours.  It is observed that the articles of capitulation are signed by S. Barron, "Flag Officer Confederate States' Navy, Commanding Naval Defences, Virginia and North Carolina," and by Wm. F. Martin, "Colonel 7th Regiment Infantry, North Carolina Volunteers."  The fort was occupied by Federal troops commanded by Colonel Max Weber, and General Butler forthwith returned to Washington, where he  received an ovation, and made a speech to the crowd extolling the deeds of the Navy.
The Confederates have since abandoned their fortifications at Ocracoke Inlet, also on the coast of North Carolina, a little to the south of Hatteras Inlet.  They carried away their guns.
Multitudes of North Carolinians were coming in to Fort Hatteras to take the oath of allegiance.  Between two and three hundred had done so in a day.
The Richmond Enquirer of the 20th ult. publishes a letter from Fernandina, Florida, which states that the crew of the celebrated privateer Jeff. Davis had arrived there-the vessel having been wrecked on the bar while trying to get into St. Augustine.
Major-General Fremont, commanding the army of the West, has issued an important proclamation from St. Louis.  He declares martial law throughout the State of Missouri.  The lines of the army of occupation are for the present declared to extend from Leavenworth, Kansas, by way of the posts of Jefferson City, Rolla, and Ironton, to Cape Girardeau, on the Mississippi River.  This includes about three-fourths of the area of the State.  "All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines shall be tried by court-martial, and, if found guilty, will be shot.  The property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall be directly proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field, is declared to be confiscated to the public use, and their slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free men."
A short telegram to Farther Point announces that Paducah, Kentucky, had been occupied by the Federalists, thus violating that neutral position which the Kentuckians have striven to maintain against both sections of the late United States.

THE CONFEDERATE STATES.
A report had been in circulation at the North and in Kentucky that President Davis died in Richmond, of a congestive fever, on the 2nd inst.  It is indicative of the absolute ignorance at the North of what passes in the South that by the 7th the report had neither been confirmed nor contradicted.  In the mean time it is certain that Mr. Davis has long been ailing, and that he had a constitution already weakened by disease.  Mr. Russell, in his last letter to the Times, speaks thus of him:-"When I last saw Mr. Davis he was recovering from an attack of tic douloureux, to which he is subject, and its agonies have been so great that he has lost the sight of one eye, I was assured, in consequence.  He is a slight, spare man, who did not appear to me capable of resisting violent desease."  If the report be true, Vice-President Stephens, of Georgia, will occupy the post of honour and of danger.  When last heard of, the Vice-President also was sick at Manassas, and he is still sparer and slighter than Mr. Davis.
East Tennessee is now co-operating with the Confederates, Knoxville, the capital, turning out some fine battalions of cavalry.
An Alabama newspaper recommends the planters to give the negroes more molosses and rice and less bacon.  This plan would diminish the consumption of bacon two millions and a quarter of pounds weekly in the Southern Confederacy.

THE NATIONAL LOAN.
The New York papers publish glowing accounts of the way in which the public are coming forward and taking the 7 3-10ths per cent loan.  Nevertheless, the aggregate subscriptions by the public (apart from the banks) are as yet only about 2,000,000 dollars.  Under these circumstances Secretary Chase has found it necessary to issue an appeal to the people of the United States in behalf of this investment.  The most interesting passages of this appeal are as follows:-
The real and personal values in the United States reach the vast aggregate of 16,000,000,000 dollars, and in the States now loyal to the Union this aggregate is 11,000,000,000 dollars.  The yearly surplus earnings of the loyal people are estimated by intelligent persons well conversant with such investigations at more than 400,000,000 dollars, while the well-considered judgment of military men of the highest rank and repute warrant the confident expectation that if the war is prosecuted with energy, courage, and skill it may be brought to a conclusion before the close of the ensuing spring, in which event the cost beyond the revenue will hardly exceed the amount of the 250,000,000 dollars loan authorised by Congress, and with a due economy in all branches of the public service not more than the total expenditures of Great Britain or France in years of peace.  And it is not unreasonable to hope that the auspicious result of peace may be hastened by the reflection of the citizens of the States in insurrection-that they will review their action, weigh their own welfare, consider the disposition of the people of the whole country to recognise all their constitutional rights, and to allow them their full share in the benefits of the common Government, and renew their allegiance to the Union which in an evil hour they have been tempted to throw off?

THE NORTHERN STATES.
The Surveyor at New York has seized some forty vessels in New York harbour, under the confiscation law, which are said to be owned at the South.  Similar seizures have taken place at Boston and Philadelphia.
The Federal Government are active in arresting persons charged with fitting out slavers from New York.
The immigration to New York this year from Europe consists chiefly of Germans, who settle on farms in the West, and are comparatively unhurt by the civil war.  The Irish, who throng the cities, feel the effect of hard times more acutely, and send home discouraging accounts, which diminish the immigration.
It having been discovered that vessels loaded with provisions and stores of all sorts were clearing for Metamoras, a port of Mexico bordering on Texas, the cargoes of which were doubtless intended for the enemy's'' use, all clearances for that port have been refused by the authorities of the seaports.
The Northern journals continue their "frantic abuse," as a Boston paper calls it, of Mr. Russell.  The leading journals deny that Fremont's proclamation in Missouri makes the war one of emancipation, and stigmatise the idea as criminal.  As recruits are not coming in quick enough, the people are warned that resort will be had, if necessary, to conscription.
Prince Napoleon and suite have been travelling in Wisconsin.

CALIFORNIA.
A San Francisco correspondent says:-
The war has not yet done any serious damage to business generally in California.  The general feeling here is one of pecuniary prosperity.  Labour is as high and as much in demand as at this time last year.  San Francisco is improving with great rapidity.  At no time in past years were so many fine buildings going up together in Montgomery-street, the Broadway of the Pacific.
The remains of T.B. M'Manus, the late Irish exile, were shipped from San Francisco on the 21st ult., for Ireland, by way of New York.  They were escorted to the dock by a procession of Irishmen.

LONDON, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER  21, 1861.
. .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . .
FROM each succeeding week's news we gather that the struggle in the States is assuming more and more steadily the aspect of a real war, to be carried on according to the known rules, and in all respects after the fashion, of the Old-World contests.  The singular m&eacute;lange of vainglorious boastings and lamentable shortcomings, of military tailoring, scandalous jobs, female influence, and incompetent officering, is gradually dying out before the stern exigencies of the occasion.  The first well-organised expedition under this new r&eacute;gime has proved entirely successful; and, though the overwhelming amount of force employed may detract a little from the honour and glory of the encounter, yet the importance of the position may fully compensate for any deficiency on that head.  The Northerners have established themselves in command of the extensive system of gulfs and creeks which lie immediately behind the easternmost point of the Southern States, and which have hitherto supplied at once protection and a vast natural harbour for privateers, and they have thus at once struck a heavy blow at this questionable system of sea robbery and at the same time secured an important outpost in the enemy's country.  In all probability a similarly well-planned expedition is at this moment sweeping down the Mississippi, and which, if successful, will have the effect, in conjunction with the blockade and the attitude of the Federal troops along the Northern border, of surrounding and isolating the whole eastern portion of the Seceding States.  We suppose, by-the-way, no sane man in this country ever believed that in the present aspect of Italian affairs Garibaldi would for a moment dream of putting the Atlantic between himself and the Mediterranean at present.  His refusal is now formally announced.  The Southerners  appear to have made a decided move in the direction of English interference:  the quasi proclamation of an intention to store the whole cotton crop and issue State Bonds against it can have no other meaning than to invite, or rather compel, us in behalf of Manchester, to break the blockade.  The step is only another proof of how little our Transatlantic cousins understand our temper.  We shall do nothing of the sort; we can buy and grow cotton elsewhere, though we admit that at present there is a doubt as to quality.  But we are not going to war for Manchester, much as we desire to see it prosperous; and this naturally brings up a regret at the somewhat gloomy aspect of commercial affairs in Lancashire and elsewhere.
[XXXIX, 292, 9/21/61]

The New York papers give a fearful account of the last hours of a murderer, James White, who was executed on the 15th ult.  On the prison authorities going to perform the preliminaries for execution, they found the prisoner armed with a chain wrenched from the wall of his cell, with which he kept them all at bay for a long time, notwithstanding that hartshorn and chloroform were used to overcome him.  In the end he made terms, surrendering for an hour's life, a good dinner, and a drink of whisky; but when on the scaffold he again broke out, and was executed by force, struggling and blaspheming to the last.

{ILLUSTRATION:  THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA: CONFEDERATES TRAPPING A BOAT'S CREW OF THE POTOMAC FLEET.-FROM A SKETCH BY OUR SPECIAL ARTIST.}
[XXXIX, 303, 9/21/61]

A SHORT time since the United States' sloop Resolute, while cruising along the Virginia shore of the Potomac, detached a boat to take possession of a scow that lay hard and fast in the mud, laden with barrels, supposed by the commander to contain powder for the use of the Disunionists.  Just as the bowsman was preparing to hold on with the boathook a murderous fire was opened from behind the bushes on the bank, killing and wounding all but one at the first discharge.  It was nothing more than a ruse to draw Federalists on, and it succeeded too well.  With great difficulty the boat was got out of range by those able to seize the oars, and shortly afterwards the Resolute came up and shelled the woods, but with what execution it is impossible to say.

THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.

THE Montreal Company's steam-ship North American brings journals from New York of the 12th inst., and telegrams to the 14th instant.  A slight engagement between Generals Rosenkranz and Floyd, near Summersville, in Western Virginia, is the only military event of the week.  The engagement was indecisive.

PRINCE GORTSCHAKOFF'S LETTER.

On the 7th inst. Baron de Stoeckl, Russian Ambassador at Washington, had an audience with the President to deliver the following despatch from the Russian Chancery:-
M. de Stoeckl, &c.		ST. PETERSBURG, July 10.
Sir,-From the beginning of the conflict which divides the United States of America you have been desired to make known to the Federal Government the deep interest with which our August Master was obseving the development of a crisis which puts in question the prosperity and even the existence of the Union.
The Emperor profoundly regrets to see that the hope of a peaceful solution is not realised, and that American citizens, already in arms, are ready to let loose upon their country the most formidable of the scourges of polical society-a civil war.  For more than the eighty years that it has existed the American Union owes its independence, its towering rise, and its progress, to the concord of its members, consecrated under the auspices of its illustrious founder, by institutions which have been able to reconcile the Union with liberty.  The Union has been faithful.  It has exhibited to the world the spectacle of a prosperity without example in the annals of history.  It would be deplorable that, after so conclusive an experience, the United States should be hurried into a breach of the solemn compact which, up to this time, has made their power.  In spite of the diversity of their constitutions and of their interests, and perhaps even because of their diversity, Providence seems to urge them to draw closer the traditional bond which is the basis of the very condition of their political existence.  In any event, the sacrifices which they might impose upon themselves to maintain it are beyond comparison with those which dissolution would bring after it.  United, they perfect themselves; isolated, they are paralysed.
The struggle which unhappily has just arisen can neither be indefinitely prolonged nor lead to the total destruction of one of the parties.  Sooner or later, it will be necessary to come to some settlement, whatsoever it may be, which may cause the divergent interests now actually in conflict to coexist.  The American nation would, then, give proof of high political wisdom in seeking in common such a settlement before a useless effusion of blood, a barren squandering of strength and of public riches, and acts of violence and reciprocal reprisals, shall have come to deepen an abyss between the two parties of the Confederation, to end definitively in their mutual exhaustion and in the ruin-perhaps irreparable-of their commercial and political power.
Our August Master cannot resign himself to admit such deplorable anticipations.  His Imperial Majesty still places his confidence in that practical good sense of the citizens of the Union who appreciate so judiciously their true interests.  His Majesty is happy to believe that the members of the Federal Government, and the infuential men of the two parties, will seize all occasions and will unite all their efforts to calm the effervescence of the passions.  There are no interests so divergent that it may not be possible to reconcile them by labouring to that end with zeal and perseverance, in a spirit of justice and moderation.
If, within the limits of your friendly relations, your language and your counsels may contribute to this result, you will respond, Sir, to the intentions of his Majesty the Emperor in devoting to this the personal influence which you may have been able to acquire during your long residence at Washington, and the consideration which belongs to your character as the representative of a Sovereign animated by the most friendly sentiments towards the American Union.  This Union is not simply in our eyes an element essential to the universal political equilibrium; it constitutes, besides, a nation to which our August Master and all Russia have pledged the most friendly interests, for the two countries, placed at the extremities of the two worlds, both in the ascending period of their development, appear called to a natural community of interests and of sympathies, of which they have already given mutual proofs to each other.
I do not wish here to approach any of the questions which divide the United States.  We are not called upon to express ourselves in this contest.  The preceding considerations have no other object than to attest the lively solicitude of the Emperor in the presence of the dangers which menace the American Union, and the sincere wishes that his Majesty enterains for the maintenance of that great work, so laboriously raised, and which appeared so rich in its future.
It is in this sense, Sir, that I desire you to express yourself, as well to the members of the general Government, as to the influential persons whom you may meet, giving them the assurance that in every event the American nation may count upon the most cordial sympathy on the part of our August Master during the important crisis which it is passing through at present.
Receive, Sir, the expression of my very deep consideration.
GORTSCHAKOFF.
Mr. Seward wrote a short and courteous reply expressing his profound sense of the "liberal, friendly, and magnanimous sentiments" of the Emperor, and regarding them "as a new guaranty of a friendship between the two countries which had its beginning with the national existence of the United States."

A DREADFUL RAILROAD CATASTROPHIE.
A railway-bridge over the Platte River, on the Hannibal and St. Joseph Line, Missouri, broke down under the weight of a passenger train, containing nearly 100 men, women, and children.  The cars were precipitated into the river.  Seventeen persons were instantly killed, and many others horribly mangled.  Only three were able to call for assistance.  It appears that the timber supports of the bridge had been nearly burnt through and the fire then extinguished, thus leaving no suspicious appearance about the structure.  It was subsequently discovered that some other bridges on the route to St. Joseph were similarly disabled, and the track obstructed by logs.  It is supposed to be the work of Missouri Secessionists.

PERSONAL.
The report of the death of Jefferson Davis is destitute of truth.
Prince Napoleon had left the United States and was travelling in Canada.  He was well received in Quebec.
The Prince de Joinville had arrived in New York, but declined the reception which was offered him by the Federal Government.

A NEAT BIOGRAPHY.-The Vice-President of the Southern Confederacy is thus described in an American journal:-"Mr. Stephens is considerable of an orator.  His health from childhood has been very feeble, being afflicted with four abscesses and a continual derangement of the liver, which gives him a consumptive appearance, though his lungs are sound.  He has never weighed over 96lb.  His figure is attenuated, his shoulders contracted, and his limbs slender.  When speaking, he has at first a shrill, sharp voice, which assumes a more sonorous character as he progresses.  His remarks are witty, rhetorical, and solid, with a dash of satire.  He was elected to the position of Vice-President (of the Southern Confederacy) on the same day with Jefferson Davis-viz. the 9th of February last."

THE contest by members of the Holland Battalion of Rifle Volunteers for cups presented by Stephen Lewin, Esq., Mayor of Boston; Frederick Cooke, Esq., Deputy Mayor; and Jos. Wren, Esq., took place yesterday week, on the practice-ground at Boston.  The cups, which were handsome and appropriate, were supplied by Mr. Joseph Angell, of the Strand, London.  That presented by the Mayor . . . [XXXIX, 313, 9/28/61] . .. . was designed and manufactured for the occasion, and ornamented in a highly emblematic style with the armorial bearings of the Corporation of Boston, being in the form of a shield having two ducal coronets in pale or; with crest, a ram couchant on a woolpack; while the arms of the cup were appropriately represented by the supporters, two mermaids proper, ducally crowned.  The other two cups were ornamented with rifle subjects in frosted silver.  The shooting commenced at ten o'clock, and finished about five.  Six members from the following corps contested-Boston, Spalding, Holbeach, Gosberton, and Donnington.  There was some excellent shooting.  The Mayor's cup, 200 yards range, was won by Quartermaster Sergeant Wheeler, of Boston; Mr. Cook's cup, 400 yards range, by Private G. Thomas, of Boston; and Mr. Wren's cup, 600 yards range, by Bugler Cocks, of the Gosberton and Donnington corps.  The successful competitors were then drawn up on the marsh, a number of ladies and gentlemen, including the Mayoress, occupied the bank, and Major Hopkins presented the several prizes in the names of the donors, complimenting the competitors upon the success which had attended their labours.  The prizemen having returned thanks, three cheers were given for them, for the donors, for the Mayoress, and the Major, and the day's proceedings terminated.

LONDON, SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1861.
((
THE wisdom of the policy which has prompted both our own and the French Government to adhere strictly to a line of non-interference in reference to the American struggle has received a remarkable confirmation in the reception given to the Emperor of Russia's well-meant recommendation.  The excellence of the intention is fully and readily recognised, but, for all practical purposes, the letter has received very much the same treatment at the hands of the Northern public as that usually assigned to intermeddlers in conjugal differences.  We believe the secret of the general non-interfering policy of the European Powers to lie in the tacit admission by all the leading statesmen-including our own-that we do not, in truth and fact, understand or appreicate in any adequate measure the real points at issue.  Meanwhile our Transatlantic brethern seem to us to ask, and very reasonably, nothing whatever but to be allowed to settle their own differences in their own way.  The future is emphatically in nubibus.  Whether, in the event of victory proclaiming for the North, a re-union effected by the coercion can have in it any element of lasting; whether any coercion can compel recalcitrant States to send members to Congress; and whether, above all, the proclamation of freedom to the black population of the south be anything more than a mere military manoeuvre;-these, and a hundred other questions of almost equal import, have their solution still in the womb of Time.  This is notably a matter in reference to which we must be pardoned if we place no faith in the prophets.

THE GREAT FALLS OF THE POTOMAC.

ABOVE Washington the Potomac is obstructed by numerous falls and rapids, around all which canals have been constructed.  The Great Falls-of which an Illustration by our Special Artist is given on page 319-are about sixteen miles above the capital, and are occupied on the Maryland side by Union troops and on the Virginian side by Confederates.  The skirmishers of both armies are continually "potting" at each other from behind the rocks, though without much damage.

AMERICAN FRILLING.-There appeared a few months back in different literary periodicals some curious particulars of the capabilities of the sewing-machine, an invention which is now so extensively employed in the world of industrial production.  We were told that amongst its multifarious applications this machine had been employed not only to sew garments of every kind, but every form of thick leather, the most delicate fabrics of the loom, the finest laces, ships' sails, and paper; even hose for draining the mines of California had passed under its operation.  One of its applications, however, was not mentioned, and this is of a kind that will especially attract the attention of the ladies.  A contrivance has been recently invented of a very simple character, which, when combined with an ordinary sewing-machine, will produce by their joint action a beautifully-regular frill.  This frill can be either firmly sewed separately or at once attached to a plain band or to some part of a dress.  By the expression "firmly sewed" we mean a frill which cannot be drawn up and down the thread, but one of which every plait or gather is tightly held and secured.  The neatness of the work is very pleasing to the eye; and the plain band frill can be produced very cheaply.  It will probably shortly be for sale in every draper's shop in the empire.  We have lately seen some frill-making machines at work, and observed the rapidity and regularity with which the article can be produced  The invention is, we believe, of American origin.  This is something beyond a labour-saving machine, since no similar article of manufacture has before been brought into the market.  Hence it has been made the subject of patent.  All the processes are conducted by girls, and another source of employment is furnished to our female population.

THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.
THE Canadian steamer North Briton brings New York journals to the 19th and telegrams to the 21st ult.

BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.
The only fighting of importance has taken place in Western Missouri, at a town called Lexington, on the south bank of the Missouri River.  General Price, of the States' rights party, commenced the attack on the Federal intrenchments at Lexington, defended by Colonel Mulligan's command, on the 16th ult.  The fight lasted all day, and ended in the repulse of the assailants.  The loss of the "rebels" is set down by the Northerners at 4000.  On the 17th and 18th the attack was renewed.  On the last occasion the "rebels" were scattered by a bayonet charge of the Irish Brigade.  The attack was to be renewed on the following day.  Meanwhile the Federals had been reinforced by 4000 men, and other reinforcements were rapidly approaching.  In the same State, at Blue Mills Landing, 600 Confederates have been routed by 1500 Federals. 
    The hitherto neutral State of Kentucky is now occupied by both Federal and Confederate troops, but no engagement had yet taken place between them.  The Kentucky Legislature, by vote of 71 to 26, has requested the Confederates to withdraw from the soil of the State; but the Confederate General replies that the possession of the pass in the Cumberland mountains is necessary for the safety of his position, and he cannot withdraw while the Federal troops are permitted to remain.
It is announced that preparations for two important movements against the Southern coast are going rapidly forward, so that the expeditions will be ready to set sail within a very few weeks. In one of them the land forces will be commanded by General Butler, and in the other by General Sherman.  The number of troops employed in the two expeditions will be 25,000 men, with naval forces of proportionate strength.  The particular points to be attacked are kept secret.

THE BLOCKADE.
   Four British vessels have been captured coming into Hatteras Inlet laden with stores from Halifax, Nova Scotia.
   The Captain-General of Cuba has issued a proclamation declaring that vessels sailing under the Confederate flag and engaged in legitimate trade will be admitted into Cuban ports on equal terms with all other vessels.
   The British Government will be allowed to communicate with their Consuls in seceded ports by means of ships of war.

THE CONFEDERATE STATES.
General Beauregard's report of the engagement of July 18 (preceding that of Bull Run) has only just been published.  It is very long compared with the insignificant proportions of the skirmish.  He admits that he was "opportunely informed of the determination of the enemy to advance on Manassas;" he terms the battle an "artillery duel;" states the losses on his side at 15 killed and 73 wounded, and that he took 20 prisoners, 175 stand of arms, a large quantity of accoutrements and blankets, and 150 hats.  The delay in the preparation of the report is owing to his "engrossing administrative duties."
The cotton and tobacco crops have been much damaged by heavy rains.  The new crop of cotton would reach, it was estimated, 3,000,000 bales.  In 1859-60 it was 4,600,000 bales.
The New Orleans banks have suspended cash payments.
Colonel John A. Washington, the nearest living relative of the Father of his Country, and the proprietor of the Mount Vernon estate, has been killed by a Federal picket, near Elkwater, in Western Virginia.

GENERAL FREMONT'S PROCLAMATION RESCINDED.
   The most important political news of the week under review is the rescinding of the slave emancipation clause of General Fremont's proclamation.  The letter of President Lincoln is as follows: - 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.
	Major-General John C. Fremont.
Sir,-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2nd inst., has been just received.  Assuming  that you upon the ground could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing your proclamation of Aug. 30, I perceived no general objection to it; the particular objectionable clause, however, in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberation of slaves, appears to me to be objectionable in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon the same subjects, and hence I wrote you expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly.  Your answer, just received, expresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for the modification, which I cheerfully do.  It is, therefore, ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed, as to conform with and not to transcend the provisions on the same subject contained in the Act of Congress, entitled "An Act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes, approved Aug. 5, 1861," and that said Act be published at length with this order.
		Your obedient servant,	A. Lincoln.

Several Republican papers in the West comment severely on this act of Mr. Lincoln; but in the East the organs of public opinion seem to acquiesce in the wisdom of the course taken.  Mr. Lincoln was influenced in this direction by a desire to retain his hold on the loyal population in the adhering and seceded Slave States.

TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS.
Three startling catastrophes are reported.  On the night of the 17th ult. a railroad bridge (10ft. high, with a span of 60ft.) on the Ohio and Mississippi Railway, in Southern Indiana, gave way under a train of cars containing a portion of the 19th Illinois Volunteers, and precipitated nearly the whole of the cars into the bed of the creek.  About 50 soldiers were killed and 100 wounded.  It is believed that Confederate sympathisers had tampered with the bridge, a large proportion of the inhabitants of Southern Indiana being emigrants from the South.
A steam-boat explosion occurred on the Sacramento River, California, on the 25th of August.  The J.A. M'Clelland exploded, killing fifteen of the passengers certainly, and probably many more.  Twelve were scalded, some of whom had since died.
At the Continental Theatre, Philadelphia, several ballet-girls were burnt to death on the 14th.  As the girls were dressing for a ballet introduced into the representation of "The Tempest," one of them, named Gale, while in the act of getting down her dress, was set on fire by the flame of a gas jet.  One of her sisters endeavoured to extinguish the flames, but in the effort her own clothes were ignited.  A third sister ran to the rescue with a like result.  In a frantic state they rushed into an adjoining room filled with ballet-girls, whose gauze also caught fire.  In their terror some of them leaped form the windows into the street. All of them were more or less severely burnt, and the result was that six of them died within a few hours after the occurrence, and four more were not expected to survive.  All the principal theatres of Philadelphia had given benefits for the families of the victims.  The Gales were Englishwomen.

COMMISSIONERS TO THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.
The President has appointed the following gentlemen to represent the interests of the American exhibitors in the World's Fair of 1862-namely, W.H. Seward, Secretary of State; Caleb Smith, Secretary of the Interior; Edward Everett, of Massachusetts; Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian Institution; Robert B. Minturn, of New York; J.D. Coleman, of Pennsylvania; J.H. Kliphart, of Ohio; J.K. Partridge, of Maryland; B.P. Jonson, of New York; Richard Wallach, Mayor of Washington; W.W. Seaton, of Washington; and J.C.G. Kennedy, Superintendent of the Census Bureau.

FINANCE.
The national loan is being taken at the rate of 700,000 dollars per diem in New York, and in smaller amounts in Philadelphia, Boston, Troy, and Pittsburg.
Exchange on England has risen to 109, a rate higher than it has ruled since the commencement of the revolution.  The Baltimore banks are forwarding their Southern deposits to England for fear of confiscation.
The Treasury demand-notes are being eagerly taken up in the West [XXXIX, 336, 10/5/61] supplying to the people, for the first time since the national bank was suppressed, a really national currency.

MISCELLANEOUS.
The New Hampshire Gazette, a journal 105 years of age, has suspended in consequence of the hard times.
The Russian Prince Salm-Salm and Major J.F. De Courcey, a British officer who held a commission in the Turkish Contingent during the Crimean War, have accepted commands in the Federal Army.  Colonel Rankin, M.P., of Canada, has offered to raise a regiment of lancers for the same cause in Canada.  This offer has been accepted.  The regiment is nominally to be deemed a Michigan regiment.
Prince Napoleon had returned from his Western and Canadian tour to New York.
[XXXIX, 337, 10/5/61]

LATEST NEWS FROM ABROAD.
The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuter's office yesterday (Friday):-
AMERICA.-New York, Sept. 24.- Lexington, Missouri, has capitulated to the Confederate forces.  The Comte de Paris and the Duc de Chartres have been appointed officers in the Federal army.  The steamers City of New York and Jura have arrived out.  The Saxonia and Persia have been intercepted off Cape Race.
The following intelligence has been received direct from the Southern States.  The cotton loan to the Federal Government amounted to 1,000,000 bales on the 6th of September.  On that day, the day President Davis was reported to have died, he was at his office at Richmond attending to his official duties.  The news is confirmed that the authorities of Spain in Cuba have issued an order to have the same protection extended to vessels sailing under the Confederate flag that is enjoyed by the flags of other countries.  At Richmond the estimated loss of the enemy at Manassas is 15,000 in killed, wounded, and prisoners.  M'Clennan is closely hemmed in between the lines of Beauregard and Johnson and the Potomac.  No importance whatever was attached to the loss of Hatteras.  The press in the South is at liberty to discuss public matters freely.  The cotton-picking season had fully commenced, and the planters were storing their crops away in the seed on the estates, there to remain at the disposal of Government until the raising of the blockade.
[XXXIX, 337, 10/5/61]

YORKTOWN, VIRGINIA.
ONE of the most important strongholds in Virginia is the peninsula between the York and James Rivers, on which are Williamsburg, the ancient capital of Virginia; Jamestown, where was the first English settlement; and Yorktown- these three localities being still in the possession of the Virginians, and strongly fortified; while the extremity of the peninsula is occupied by the Federalists, together with the fortress (Monroe) at the point.  Independently of its importance in the present war, the old city of Yorktown is full of interest both to the antiquarian and lover of the picturesque.
Originally Virginia was divided into only eight counties, of which York was one, Yorktown having been made the capital in 1705.  The counties have been gradually added to and subdivided subsequently, in proportion to the increase of population and extension of the settlements west of the mountains, there now being upwards of one hundred and fifty.
During the early history of Virginia, Yorktown was a place of much commercial importance, and there are again anticipations of a magnificent future for this dilapidated and desolated village.  For many years it has been only an unimportant fishing town, having remained in its original condition and retained its old associations: only two buildings have been erected since the revolutionary war.  The old church, built 170 years ago, was burned down in 1814, a "frame" edifice having since replaced it.  The churchyard, like those of several other early settlements, bears quite an English appearance.  Old family tombstones, with broad slabs and carved inscriptions, lie broken and half buried in weeds and rubbish.
The Swan Tavern, still standing, and now crowded with soldiers, is said to be the oldest in Virginia; but the building exciting the largest share of interest is the old Nelson Mansion (from which our View was taken), the family residence of the Nelsons, who emigrated from Cumberland, occupied a high standing in the county of York, and were the "ancestors of all the Nelsons" in Virginia.  During the revolutionary war, when this place was occupied by the English, and bombarded by the allied armies of France and America, Lord Cornwallis made the Nelson House his headquarters until one day, whilst his Lordship was at dinner, his favourite servant in attendance was shot by a cannon-ball which entered through the wall.  After this unwelcome visitor Cornwallis removed his quarters to a less prominent abode.
Two or three months ago the quiet and unoffending citizens of Yorktown were pursuing their peaceful avocations when a couple of war-steamers appeared off the shore, and several cannon balls came flying through the air, without, however, doing any other injury than to the nerves of the women and children, who forthwith "packed up" and departed for safer localities, while the men took immediate precautions to defend the place, which is now one vast military encampment.  There is a long line of camps on the ridge of the high river banks, another in an open space of the woods beyond, and a third is down on the shore; behind you, around you, which ever way you turn, the pointed tents dart up in bright relief before the broad river and blue line of distant coast, or lie snugly embedded in the dark green woods; and from one or another of these encampments one's ears are perpetually assailed by the drum and the fife, which comprise the principal military music of Yorktown.  The Southern stock of band instruments is nearly exhausted, so the fife rings changes on the martial airs of "Dixie Land" and the "Marseillaise," varied by Irish jigs; and the drum beats time to the march or parade.  Round the corner of an old building pour forth a company of soldiers in "undress"-very "undress"-costume, looking like a troop of navvies, though one-half may be men of fortune and position, who at home command their hundred servants and their carriages and horses, but here willingly, eagerly, shoulder their axe, and sally forth at dawn of day to throw up breastworks and erect batteries.
Across that field march a company to drill, along that road goes another; there a patrol of Zouaves are keeping guard before the head-quarters of the General, which is an old, dilapidated building of revolutionary times.  Here comes a troop of horses, then a line of baggage- waggons of crazy form and uncertain motion; yonder is a train of a hundred mules.  The old town is alive with bustle, the whole scene is bewildering.  It is not English in spite of the antique buildings, which are at variance with the character of the foliage, the bright sky, and glaring sun.  The river reminds one of the Exe below Powderham, without its background of Haldon and Warborough.  It is dotted with little butterfly fishing-boats, which, peacefully gliding here and there, add another contradiction to this scene of warlike preparations, and with a telescope you may even see the malicious Pawnee cruising about the mouth of the river, some fifteen miles off, not daring, however, to come within gunshot.  The scene is not American, with those dull, dingy, old dwellings, in place of the gaily-painted, fanciful little eggshell residences of modern America.  The groups of loungers are perfectly American though, entirely at ease and at home, whether perched upon fences, sitting on doorsteps, or lounging under the trees.  But along come a company of Zouaves, and the American associations are wafted to Algeria or the Crimera, which are again destroyed by the most unoriental scenery, and the negro women in Eastern turbans and very Western crinolines.  It is a scene of itself, of the times and the occasion, a scene in this second great American revolution, which will take its place in the world's history as far different in its complication of causes and results as is the scene above descibed.
The whole scenery of Yorktown is picturesque, even in its present most desolate and rugged condition. The foliage of locust and linden trees is everywhere beautiful-the tramp of soldiers cannot affect that-and there is a sad poetry in the luxuriance of the vines and wild flowers which spring up in every corner, the broken fences and the trampled gardens smiling again under the magnificence of the gaudy trumpet-flower, and every heap of rubbish covered with the delicate passion-flower.  The embankments freshly thrown up are soon green with vegetation, and a few minutes' walk will take you into woods where war and strife seem but a dream or a history of the past.  From wooded banks deep ravines and romantic roads wind down to the shore, which, covered with fine sand, is washed by a few semi-saline waves and marine plants.

LONDON, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1861.
IT no doubt savours of cowardice to indulge in any sort of exultation at the difficulties of a rival; but it is indeed difficult to peruse the file of American journals brought over by each successive mail without something like a quiet chuckle at the singular admissions which are gradually and most reluctantly forced out.  Blessed ourselves with a really free and constitutional Government, a responsible Ministry, an unfettered press, and tribunals of unquestionable integrity, it has been difficult-perhaps we ought rather to say unpalatable-to our imaginations to picture the actual condition of internal affairs on the other side of the Atlantic which has contributed so largely to bring about the present struggle, and promises fair to make its final solution a work of such time and difficulty.  The serious hindrances presented by the want of a standing army and an adequate navy, formidable as they are, appear to us as nothing compared with the entire absence of actual freedom of thought and action involved in such proceedings as the torture of independent editors, an exercise of female influence rivalling the worst features of the Court of Louis XIV., and a consequent thrusting into responsible positions of men of no real competency whatever.  It is impossible at the same time not to connect this chronic disorder of the most exalted functions of American administration with the tone at once so unfairly and so persistently indulged in in reference to the attitude and intentions of this country.  When will our Transatlantic kinsmen-as well as French Colonels and M. Dupin-begin to understand that war is the very last thing an Englishman thirsts for?  It is forced upon us undoubtedly from time to time, and we accept it as a necessity, and so meet and subdue it; but we recognise it all the while as an odious necessity, involving an expenditure of human lives which we would fain spare, a waste of national treasure which we can ill afford, and an interruption to commerce which strikes us like a malignant disorder.  A most miserable subject for contemplation is no doubt furnished by the present condition and future prospects of our cotton trade, and of the hundreds of thousands implicated in it; but even this, the South may be well assured, will not tempt us to force the blockade.  We can and shall wait for better times and wiser counsels.

[XXXIX, 351, 10/5/61]

ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.

MUNSON'S HILL, WITH THE EARTHWORK THROWN UP BY 
 THE CONFEDERATES IN FRONT OF THE UNION LINES, VIRGINIA.
THIS is the point in Virginia at which the Unionists and the Confederates are nearest each other, and whilst our Artist was making his sketch, crouched beneath the shelter of the foliage, within hailing distance of the enemy's pickets, a continual spattering of bullets fell round the spot.  More than halfway up the road towards the hill is a barricade, from behind which a Secessionist sharpshooter is having some pot shots, and, screened by the hedges in the cornfields, others are doing the same.  In the foreground are the Union advanced pickets, furnished by the Michigan Regiment, one of whom is in the act of firing at two or three men beyond the barricade.  A Michigan soldier just shot lies in the road.  The Confederates have some rifled cannon on the earthwork, and whenever they see a number of Federalists together they send in a dose of shells.
A New York paper thus describes the Confederate position on Munson's-hill:-"Munson's-hill is probably the highest eminence within ten miles of the Potomac, immediately opposite Washington.  It is about six miles from the Capitol, the intervening space being covered with a succession of gently rolling hills, crowned principally with forest trees, although here and there dotted with churches, farmhouses, and country villages.  The streams are unimportant and the roads dusty.  The hill presents its most abrupt side towards the national capital, and, unlike those around, has but few trees on its summit.  Many of those which originally existed have no doubt been felled while the intrenchments were in progress.  At present an immense Confederate flag-the red, white, and blue stripes in which  are at least five feet wide each-is the most prominent object upon the top of the eminence  Two of the trees which have been allowed to remain were used as an observatory.  The Confederate defences are constructed entirely of earth, fifteen feet being the highest elevation.  The sloping hillside in front of the fort is clear of underbrush or trees, and is sufficiently extended to allow 3000 men to parade.  The distance from the cover of the woods to the summit of the hill is not so great but that a quick movement would drive the enemy from their guns with very little loss of life.  The flank defences of the fort consist of three batteries.  It is believed that earthworks have been thrown up on another portion of the hill commanding the road to Fairfax Courthouse.  The fort is intended more particularly to command the road leading from Alexandria to Falls Church, the road from Washington to Fairfax, just mentioned, the railroad from Alexandria to Vienna, and the position of Bailey's Cross-roads."

COTTON IN INDIA.-The following extract from a Kurrachee circular of the 7th ult. is interesting, as showing how the movement for the production of cotton is spreading in the Punjaub.  It is understood that a considerable breadth of land is now being sown with this staple, for the growth of which that region is exceedingly well adapted:-"Cotton.-A stimulus has been imparted to this article by the news received from England by last mail, and the further intelligence by telegraph vi Galle to the 18th ult. of an engagement having been fought between the contending forces in America, attended with disastrous results to the Federalists.  The consequence has been an increased inquiry for cotton, and Sind qualities have changed hands in considerable quantities, whilst a rise of eight rupees per candy is noticeable in the prices above those ruling a fortnight ago."
[XXXIX, 361, 10/5/61]

THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.
BY the Canadian steamer Anglo-Saxon we have advices from New York to the 28th ult.

THE WAR IN MISSOURI.
On the 20th ult. Colonel Mulligan surrendered Lexington to the besieging force of the Confederates.  The men had fought for fifty-nine hours without water, and had only three barrels of vinegar to quench their thirst.  Previous to the surrender Colonel Mulligan offered to take a position on a level spot of ground and give General Price the odds of four to one in a fair and open fight, but no attention was paid to the challenge.  About 250,000 dollars in gold fell into the possession of the captors.  The morning after the surrender the men were all released on parole not so [sic] serve again during the war, and ferried across the river.  The officers were retained.  Colonel Mulligan's loss was about 150, while that of General Price was not more than 300.  Much dissatisfaction is felt by the Administration and the public that General Fremont did not send troops in time to relieve Lexington.  General M'Culloch, at the head of 15,000 Confederates, was within fifteen miles of Lexington on the 21st.  A slight engagement had also taken place at Papinsville, in the same State, to the advantage of the Federals, under General Lane.
The complaints against General Fremont multiply on all sides.  He is accused of extravagance in the expenditure of public money, superciliousness of demeanour, and of living in too sumptuous a style, surrounded, moreover, by a body guard.  The Germans of the north-west are stanch partisans of Fremont, and it is doubtful if the Administration will think it expedient to remove him.

THE NAVAL EXPEDITION.
Sherman's naval expedition against the Southern coast will sail in three weeks' time from our latest dates at the farthest.

KENTUCKY.
The neutrality of this State has ceased to exist.  General Buckner, of the Confederate army, occupies Bowling Green, in Southern Kentucky, and will hold it until driven out or until the Federals retire.  General Anderson, of Fort Sumter fame, is in command of the Federalists at Louisville.  Both Generals are Kentuckians.  The war in Kentucky, as in Missouri and Western Virginia, will partake of all the repulsive features of a truly civil war, opinion in that State being very equally divided between the two parties.

WASHINGTON.
The Comte de Paris and Duc de Chartres have been added to General M'Lellan's Staff.  The young Comte de Penthivre, son of Prince de Joinville, was to enter the United States' Naval Academy.  Count Liebenhoff, of Russia; Lieutenant Oscar Brendeuer, of Prussia; Major Bausenwein, Aide-de-Camp to Garibaldi; Lord Aldophus Vane Tempest, of England; Captains Vegesackand Holtman, of Sweden; and Major Kirk, of Canada, have taken service in the Federal Army.
Mr. Seward has refused to accede to the prayer of a memorial that he would prevent the continuance of Mr. Russell's letters to the Times.  In a carefully-worded letter, he says it has not been the practice of the United States' Government to concern itself with the representations made by the press of foreign countries.  The American press is free to reply thereto.  Moreover, the Times only circulates about fifty copies in the United States.  For the offence of republication American editors, not the Enlgish correspondent, are liable.  A hundred foreigners as intellligent, virtuous, and respectable as Mr. Russell is are, says Mr. Seward, daily enrolling themselves in the Federal Army.  The country can, therefore, afford to tolerate the heresies of one man.
Secretary Seward grants passports to coloured men who are desirous of proceeding to Europe.  Since the Dred Scott decision, passports had been refused to this class.  Secretary Cameron has forbidden coloured men to appear in Washington dressed in military uniform.  A portion of the 2000 slaves who had fled to Fort Monroe have been sent to Washington and set to work there by the Department of War.
Mr. Seward has issued a circular in explanation of the Confiscation Act, in which he states that the law only contemplates a seizure of such property as may be in transit to or from insurrectionary States or used for the promotion of the rebellion; and that real estate, bonds, promissory notes, and moneys on deposit are not subject to confiscation in the absence of evidence of such unlawful uses.

THE NORTHERN STATES.
On the 26th ult. the observance of a national fast and humiliation took place.
Prince Napoleon and the Princess Clotilde had left New York for Boston and the manufacturing towns of Massachusetts, with which they expressed themselves much pleased.
Vigorous measures for the suppression of the slave trade are being taken in New York.  Two vessels have been condemned in that city for participating therein.
The New York Herald publishes the following list of "peace party" newspapers suspended since the commencement of the war:-"Papers suspended by the authorities, 17; destroyed by mobs, 10; died naturally, 5; denied the mails, 5; changed their politics, 7; whose editors are in prison, 6."
The Boston correspondent of the Springfield Republican gives an account of the way in which the President was reluctantly persuaded to sign the bill confiscating the slaves which were used in aid of the "rebellion."  He says:-
We got over a bad difficulty when President Lincoln was persuaded by Bingham, Wade, Wilson, and Sumner  to sign  the Confiscation Bill, against not only his will, but against his apparently fixed intention.  I see that Russell has let out the main facts, but there are some details.  The bill was carried to the President by Senator Bingham of Michigan, of the Committee on Enrolled Bills.  It was in the last half hour of the Session, and the adjournment could not be delayed.  Bingham took an interest in the bill, and waited to see what old Abe would do with it.  The President looked it over carefully and laid it down.  "You don't sign this bill, Mr. President?" said Bingham, inquiringly.  "No: I am not going to sign it."  "Well, then, will you at least veto it, and send it back so we can pass it if we chose?"  "No, I shan't do that."  "What are your objections, Mr. President?"  "It will lose us Kentucky."  "D-n Kentucky!"  exclaimed Bingham.  The President looked up good-humouredly and retorted, "Then d-n you!"  Bingham, it seems to me, had an excuse in the emergency which pressed upon him and the frivolous character, to him, at least, of the President's excuse; and old Abe may be pardoned for disliking to hear his native State anathematised.  Well; Bingham rallied the Senators whose names I have mentioned, and perhaps others, and they persuaded the President to sign the bill.  I believe Mr. Seward assisted in the good work.
Under the influence of Western orders and war expenditure, business is reviving in the Atlantic States, and many factories which had closed their doors in the spring have resumed operations on full time.

THE NATIONAL LOAN.
A great number of agencies for receiving subscriptions have been opened in different parts of the country, and small amounts are subscribed, but the receipts have fallen off considerably at New York, and the aggregate subscription from the whole country has not, during the week under review, exceeded 500,000 dollars per diem.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt the banks will furnish the second 50,000,000 dols. on the 15th inst., although they will not have disposed of the whole of the first installment of the loan to the public.

CALIFORNIA.
In the State election the Republican ticket has prevailed by a large majority.  It is doubtful whether the war or peace democratic ticket polled the next largest number of votes.
There are a large number of Texans arriving in California by the overland route.  They are mostly of Unionist sympathies, and represent the state of things in Texas as deplorable.
The commissioners appointed to settle the boundary between British and American territory have completed their work.

The following telegram was received through Mr. Reuter's office yesterday (Friday):-

AMERICA.-New York, Sept 28.-It is reported from Washington that the Confederates have erected a long line of batteries on the Lower Potomac.  Several Federal steamers passing up and down have been fired into.  A considerable force of Confederates is assembled between Occoquan and Acquia Creeek [sic].  It is rumoured that they will endeavour to cross the river at this point.  General Fremont and his Staff have left for Jefferson city.  It is estimated that the Confederates captured at Lexington a million and a half dollars, seven cannon, and 4000 rifles.  The Federal troops have stormed and captured Romney, Western Virginia.  The Confederates retreated to the mountains.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN
AMERICA.
THE  two great armies still stand at bay on the lines of the Potomac, and the chain-bridge across that river, above Georgetown, of which an Illustration by our Special Artist is given below, is a position of great interest just now, as the Confederates are continually making threatening movements in the neighbourhood, either with the intention of destroying the bridge or of crossing by it into Maryland.  On the heights on the Virginian shore are seen the tents of the Federal advance, which throws out pickets to a distance of two miles beyond.  The Maryland end of the bridge is commanded by an upper and a lower battery, both of them very strong positions.
On the opposite page we give an Illustration, from a Sketch by our Special Artist, of the bringing in the Federal wounded after the skirmish at Lewinsville, Virginia.  Just as the wounded were being brought in General M'Clellan reached the ground with an Aide-de-Camp and an escort of dragoons.  He raised his hat as each poor fellow was borne from the ambulance to the hospital; and many whose eyes were fast glazing in death raised themselves in the arms of those who bore them and smiled a last smile at their young and beloved General.
Our Special Artist writes from Washington on the 23rd ult. as follows:-
"I have just come from a cruise down the Potomac, and while away I fell in with the officer who was bringing the news of the Scracoke affair to the Navy department.  The Sketch I forward is done over his own lines on the paper.  There will, in all probability, be more details by next mail.  I have got some river subjects, which will come on in a day or two.  In the meantime I send these two.  I expect to go out west, to Rosencrantz and Fremont; but yet we may have an attack here from hour to hour, and I dare scarcely leave.  Both sides are now awfully close together, and very, very strong.  I am waiting to get some definite notion of the next move on the cards, and shall then act promptly."

There can be no doubt that the armies of the Northern States of America are preparing for grand and various action, and now that the weather permits them to move freely we shall hear of simultaneous attacks upon Southern positions.  The enormous size of the "seat of war" is a condition of the contest not sufficiently taken into consideration here, and it is, indeed, difficult to realise it.  Without careful study of the map and due regard to the vast distances between the points at which hostilities are carried on or threatened, justice will not be done to the obstacles in the way of the chiefs on either side, and the fabulous-seeming numbers of the forces which are being brought up appear reasonable only when the extent of territory is taken into account.  We repeat that the Old World may now look to hear of actions on a larger scale than war has yet exhibited.  Meantime, the only demonstration calling for special notice is one against an Englishman.  The letters of Mr. William Russell have given so much offence to persons who dislike plain statements of disasters that application has actually been made to Mr. Seward to prevent the publication of these despatches.  Mr. Seward, however, perceives the absurdity of the demand to fight, as some vestries debate, "with closed doors and the exclusion of reporters," and he has declined to interfere, giving his refusal in a grave document, for the solemnity of which the Minister must have indemnified himself by non-official smiles at the enforced rotundity of his periods.  Two of the Orleanist Princes have placed themselves on General M'Lellan's staff, but have declined to receive pay for their services, a decision which may evince an honesty of estimate of their value.  The New York Herald, which is supposed to be really in the pay of the South, as heretofore and until its weathercock conversion, does its best to generate ill-feeling between the North and England, by a renewal of the ridiculous threat that as soon as the "rebellion" is put down English rule in America shall be swept away.  But our American brethren may rest assured that we distinguish between the feeling of a great and glorious nation and the malicious nonsense of an insincere and hireling scribbler.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
The following memoir of Mr. Davis, President of the Confederate States of North America, is from specimen articles of the "New American Cyclopaedia," by George Ripley and Charles A. Dana:-
"Davis, Jefferson, an American soldier and statesman, born June 3, 1808, in that part of Christian county, Kentucky, which now forms Todd county.  Soon after his birth, his father, Samuel Davis, a planter, who served during the revolutionary war in the mounted force of Georgia, removed with his family to Mississippi, and settled near Woodville, Wilkinson county.  Young Davis received an academical education, and was sent at the usual age to Transylvania College, Kentucky, which he left in 1824 to enter the United States' Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated in 1828, and was appointed Brevet Second Lieutenant.  He remained in the army seven years, and served as an infantry and staff officer on the north-west frontier in the Black Hawk war of 1831-2, with such distinction that, March 4, 1833, he was promoted to a First Lieutenantcy of Dragoons, in which capacity he was employed in 1834 in various expeditions against the Comanchees, Pawnees, and other hostile Indian tribes.  He resigned his commission June 30, 1835, returned to Mississippi, and became a cotton-planter, living in retirement till 1843, when he began to take an active part in politics on the democratic side, and in 1844 was chosen one of the presidential electors of Mississippi to vote for Polk and Dallas.  In November, 1845, he was elected a representative in Congress, and took his seat in December of that year.  He bore a conspicuous part in the discussions of the Session on the tariff, on the Oregon question, on military affairs, and particularly on the preparations for war against Mexico, and on the organisation of volunteer militia when called into the service of the United States.  While in Congress, in July, 1846, the 1st Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers, then enrolled for service in Mexico, elected him their Colonel.  He promptly left his seat at the House, and, overtaking his regiment in New Orleans, on its way to the seat of war, led to reinforce the army of General Taylor on the Rio Grande.  He was actively engaged in the attack and storming of Monterey, in September, 1846; was one of the commissioners for arranging the terms of the capitulation of that city; and highly distinguished himself in the battle of Buena Vista, February 23, 1847, where his regiment, attacked by an immensely superior force, maintained their ground for a long time unsupported, while Colonel Davis himself, though severely wounded, remained in the saddle until the close of the action, and was complimented for his coolness and gallantry by the Commander-in-Chief in his despatch of March 6, 1847.  At the expiration of the term of its enlistment, in July, 1847, the Mississippi Regiment was ordered home; and Colonel Davis, while on his return, received at New Orleans a commission from President Polk as Brigadier-General of Volunteers, which he declined accepting, on the ground that the Constitution reserves to the States respectively the appointment of the officers of the militia, and that, consequently, their appointment by the Federal Executive is a violation of the right of the States.  In August, 1847, he was appointed by the Governor of Mississippi, United States, senator, to fill a vacancy; and at the ensuing Session of the State Legislature, Jan. 11, 1848, was unanimously elected to the same office for the residue of the term, which expired March 4, 1851.  In 1850 he was re-elected for the ensuing full term.  In the Senate he was chosen Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, and took a prominent part in the debates on the slavery question, in defence of the institutions and policy of the Slave States, and was a zealous advocate of the doctrine of State rights.  In September, 1851, he was nominated candidate for Governor of Mississippi by the Democratic party, in opposition to Henry S. Foote, the candidate of the Union party.  He resigned his seat in the Senate on accepting the nomination, and was beaten in the election by a majority of 999 votes-a marked indication of his personal popularity in his own State, for at the 'convention election,' two months before, the Union party had a majority of 7500.  After his defeat Colonel Davis remained in retirement until the Presidential contest of 1852, when he took the stump in behalf of General Pierce in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana, where he rendered essential service to the democratic party.  In 1853 he was appointed by President Pierce Secretary of War, which post he held till the accession of President Buchanan in 1857.  His administration of the War department was marked by ability and energy, and was highly popular with the army.  He proposed or carried into effect, among other measures, the revision of the army regulations; the introduction of camels into America; the introduction of the light infantry or rifle system of tactics, the manufacture of rifled muskets and pistols, and the use of the Mini&eacute; ball, the addition of four regiments to the army, the augmentation of the seacoast and frontier defences of the country, and the system of explorations in the western part of the continent for geographical purposes, and for the determination of the best route for a railroad to the Pacific Ocean.  Having been previously re-elected on his retirement from the War department, Colonel Davis re-entered the Senate for the term ending March, 1863.  In the sessions of the 35th Congress he has been conspicuous in the discussions on the French Spoliation Bill, which he opposed, and on the Pacific railroad for the southern route, of which he is a zealous and most influential advocate."
