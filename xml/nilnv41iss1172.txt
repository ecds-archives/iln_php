The Chamber has heard with amazement that other vessels are fitting out in British ports to continue the work of destruction begun by the Alabama. It is the duty of the Chamber of Commerce to warn British merchants that a repetition of such sate as horning the Brilliant, by vessels fitted out in England and manned by British seamen, cannot foil to produce widespread exasperation in America. The Chamber therefore invokes the influence cc all men who voles peace and goodwill among all nations to prevent the departure of other vessels of the same character from them ports, and thus avert the calamity of war. The resolutions close by declaring that it is the desire and interest of Americans to cherish and maintain saute- monte of amity with England. Copies of the resolutions are to be forwarded to the British Board of Trade. The captures affected by the Alabama have injuriously effected the freights for American shipping.

American news is interesting, though as yet not very important. The "feat of arms " of the war has been General Stuart's ride round General M'Clellan's army. The gallant feraglig party had it all their own way-carried oil horses, arms, clothing, and all that they required, and, despite ld'Glellsn'e threat that not one of them should escape, all but see escaped, if the word be applicable to so triumphant a raid. Another enemy has still more grievously disquieted the North, the Alabama, which has made such havoc among the merchant-ships of the Federals that the rate of freight is seriously affected end the mercantile folks are scolding England for having allowed the Alabama to fit out. The Confederates dashed at Lexington, and plundered, and retreated, it is said, with lees. They claim Perryeville as a victory, and say they can show 1)000 prisoners. The army of MOleIlau -stated tcbe advancing. But the civil struggle now waging is of more importance as regards the war. The Democrats and Bepablieane are in deadly close over the State elections. and should the former triumph in the great States the Cabinet of Yr. Lincoln will real and totter.

We may add to Our American summary-for the matter has principal reference to the war-that Mr. Cnbdan has delivered two long speeches

Richmond, Virginia, Sept. 20.

ON my return to Richmond from the army under -oral Lee, with

drawings and material descriptive of the late successes that have groaned the Confederate arms, I find to my great disgust that a loop letter fin the connecting link between my campaign in the

North ard my visit South has been loot. This letter was mt noted to

Gc dlq arid unfortunat I while on his way to the latter city he yhis, portirienteau. R )e ship was on the point of leaving and, ofit

5eirifleing his baggogo and my correspondence, he left in her. I have

just received a telegraphic despatch from Messrs. Frazier and Co., the

egoists of the gentlemooi in question in Charleston, in answer to one of nay own inquiring about the safety of my letter, acquainting me with the mishap, and also bringing me the intelligence that the portininteau

-has teen traced arid that they hope to have it forwarded to them in

time to leave by the next steamer. There i no disguising the fact that nay lines of communication are exceedingly hazardous and that I am compelled to rely solely on the successful running of the

blockade--a ucetal arrangement which has very little certainty in its operation. some elm drat sketches from the South were loot in the

broad current of the ?domao, the person who had them in charge . them ovarboal with other papers while being chased by a

Na.riOL7bini T., or three of these I have redrawn, and I now send !' i.' addition to others of the late battle on the plains of v;t_~wu, on the present cocasion I have had to be my own courier as fee as hers, and as soon as I ass this packet safely off I shall return toee.mp.

.The more I see of the Southern army the more I can lost in adrsiration at its splendid patriotism, at its wonderful endurance, at its utter disregard of hardships which, probably, no modern army has been called upon to bear up against. Wretchedly equipacl, the soldiers of the Confederacy advance to meet their foes e light of baths shining on their countenances, determined to be vie-. terious or 'die. I have seen them marching over the hot and dusty roads of Virginia, unifornalees, shoeless, many with nothing but a thin, well-worn shirt to shelter thOrn from the scorching rays of the son, said et every man cheered his comrade, and all as they their leeding feet along made light of their sufferings, and

renewed elasticity strode forward on their way, many to their

graves, The lies I had heard in the North of disaffection in the ccath have been refuted to me a thousandfold. My own eyes and can have contradicted at every step I have taken the calumnies circulated to the prejudice of a people firmly united in their desire for earaticn from the old Government, and resolved to fight for their independence till the last man has been called from his home and the last plantation laid waste, What a grand picture does this colossal revolution present; how near to heroism is this people brought who, sacrificing everything-mothers their sons, wives their lnsaban,?.e, all they hold dear-for that which every couintr' has fought for at some time during its history-its rights! Yes, with all Europe against them-for are not the ports of the Northern States open to the world?-these Saxons of one South, blockaded in their

_1aaxbcucs.wtth aon'varms . dusivsti of those onacuxoes which alone
-iile tEEd anaigy formidable yet drive beck the countless legions ad

the invader from their soil, and with "lo triomphal" on their tattered banners, prepare to carry the desolation which they have suffered to the homes of their adversaries.

Sorely year readers by this time have learned to properly estunite the empty assurancee and vain boastings of the Northern Governoeent and press in ralarenoe to the suppression of the rebellion. Mr. Seward's oiroulare to the United States' Ministers abroad have been marvellous specimens of premises on a promise to do something. At each additional disaster to the Federal arms he has paraphrased in his despatches the words of the popular song, "There's a good time coming, bcye, only wait a 11ff is longer;" and for eighteen weary oseeths of bloedahad he has been singing this refrain, and each month his voice has grown more uncertain and wavering in the notes. How long England and Prance will submit to be bamboozled by the hallow representations of the Federal Government remains to be seen; as it is they have held aloof long enough, and precedents which they have followed in other cases demand that the two Powers at the heed of eivilieatien should interfere to stop the butchery which disgraces the century we live in. The cell for six hundred thousand more men in the Forth goes a long way to show that hitherto Mr. Seward has been cheating Europe into the belief that the Southern revolt was nothing. What has become of the first six hundred thousand i Their bones lie whitening in the fields around Corinth; the plains of Manaseas are one hogs Northern graveyard. Prom the Tames to the York River, on the banks of the Cbickalaominy and the Pamunkey, the slaughtered thousands of the once proud army of the Potomac sleep their last sleep. And should Mr. Lincoln be successful in his demand far new lsvico, which I very much doubt, the beginning of the end will be as far off as ever. Surrounded as I am by the Southern people, living in their midst, associating with their soldiers, I emphatically assert the South can never be subjugated. There is not a mother with two sons, having lest one by a Northern bullet, who will not freely offer up the ether on the altar of her country. As I have said before, there are men serving in the ranks of the Southern army worth a hundred thousand dollars (120,000) submitting to every privation-and such privations ware never known-and, if need be, they will continue to bear with them and prolong the struggle for years. Never have I hoard a doubtful word expressed as to the ultimate result of the war now waged by the Southerners: every . soldier of the Confederacy is impressed with the stamp, of individuality, and has a confidence in himself which half a million of Northerners cannot shake. And should din necessity demand that more blood should be shed in addition to that which already crimsons the fields of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, there will be five hundred thousand such men ready to form a barricade with their bodies over which the invaders of their soil will have to pass. We have seen the first great Northern army swept away, and the second will scarcely fare better. The South is now thoroughly aroused; the late victories that have crowned its arms have made it more hopeful and determined than ever. The North, on the contrary, is demoralisad by a succession of reverses, which even the mendacious despatches of its Generals have failed to conceal, The whole Northern people ard writhing under the disgrace of the continued defeats of their wsll-etpnipped armies by, as they themselves tent the foe, a halfstarveu ragged mob of rebels, Will their past experience in the war increase the prestige of their new levies in the field 1' It 'o hardly probable. Their forces, beaten everywhere cannot commence a new campaign, even should they be psrmitta to do so by the European Powers, without the dead weight of previous disaster sxeraoan,g ita depresaing influence upon them. However this may be, the Sourn well be found prepared, and, whatever the result, nobly, I am convinced, will she stem the tide of battle. I would wish to

 continue this letter, ,and give a comprehensive view to your readers

of the social and pehtical policy of,tho South; but tims is short and I must delay to the next opportunity the multitudinous facts that I have collected for the benefit of your readers. Hoping this may reach YOU safely I am Tours over, " "

LONDON, SATURDAY, NOT'RiflJRR 5, lees.

The Northern States of America are engrossed with the State elections, which appear to be going against Mr. Lincoln and his party and in favour of the Demoentry, which now claims to "command the situation," and which repudiates end denounces the so-called abolition proclamation. The members in course of election will have no constitutional position for a year, but the public opinion manifested by such a reaction as is alleged will have immediate and formidable operation. The war news is almost all.

TEE AMERICAN OIL-WELLS.

In the columns of this Journal have been given from time to time accounts of the wonderful oilsprings found in the United States and in Canada, accompanied by conjeatures as to how the oil is produceda point on which geologists are not agreed. Sometimes the oil bubbles out on the top of streams, or rises freely to the surface, bursting forth occasionally in jets several feet high; but generally the oil is attained by sinlzing wells and booing. These oil-springs at times catch fire with, as may be supposed, the most terrible results. One scene of tile kind is thus described by the Buffalo Courier:-" Dazing the drilling of an oil-wail at Tidione, Pennsylvania a sudden rush of oil, at the rate of seventy barrels an hour, took pines the stream ascending 4Oft, above the eurfaoe of the ground. Above this mass of oil the gas or benaine rose in a cloud far flit. or fi Oft. All the fires in the neighbourhood were immediately extmgnished, except one 400 yards distant. The the from this ignited the floating gas, and in a moment the whole air was in roaring flames. As seen as the gas trek fire the head of the jet of oil was in a furious blaze, and falling like water from a fountain over a space of 100Th. in diameter each drop of oil came down a blazing globe of boiling oil. Instantly tha ground was in a flame, constantly increased and augmented by the falling oil. At once a scone of indescribable horror teak place. Scarce were thrown flat for a distance of 201 t, and numbers horribly burned, rushing blazing from the hell of misfortune, shrieking and screaming in their anguish. The whole air was on fire. The jet of oil, rushing up 4Oft., was almost a pillar of livid flame, while the as above it, to the distance of 100Th., was flashing exploding, dashing towards the heavens, and apparently licking be clouds with its furious tongues of heat. All tine time, during this tremendous seanbustion, the sounds of the explosions and buminge were so tremendous and continuous that they could be compared to nothing but the rushing of a hurricane or tornado through the forest. The heat of the fire was so intense that no one could approach within liOft. It was the most frightful and yet the grandest pyrotechnical display ever vouchsafed to a humsat being. The oil burned until it was exhausted,"

Mr. Alexander S. Macrae, petroleum oilbrcker, of Liverpool, has obligingly furnished us with a photographic view of one of these oil

regions-the Spouting Wells at 0,1 Creek, Pennsylvania-from which

we give an Engraving at page 403. In the front of the Illustration is chassis a large vat, or cistern, in which a spouting well is running the oil. Owing to the specific lightness of the petroleum it floats upon the surface of water, and any deleterious matter which may n nn with it is at once precipitated to the bottom, whence it is readily extricated. The oil is run into good strong forty-gallon casks, and dispatched to the refineries at home, or exported to avery port in Europe. Phillips's Well is estimated to yield 3000 casks per week. This time last year, suites Mr. Macme, petroleum oil was almost unknown in Europe, since which we have imported and consumed from 150,000 to 200,000 casks, representing more than half a million sterling. The uses of this oil are many, In refining, spirits of petroleum are produced, from which a turpentine substitute is made, now being largely used m the place of spirits of turpentine, The next and the must important derivative is the patrols= oil, used for burning in paraffin-lamps. Lubricating oils and greases are likewise extracted from at, and war also in great quantities. In the United States and Canada more than one hundred refineries have been created.

We also believe that no ether intervention would be possible than one similar to the advice which Russia ha constantly tendered in a friendly spirit since the comInenesuant of the struggle.
The Emperor of the French is desirous that England and hassle should join him in proposing a suspension of hostilities between the belligerent Powers in America. A despatch from if. Dronyn de Lhoye to these two Powers appears in Thursday's Afeeitesn, in which he states that "the Emperor has charged him to propose to the Cabinets of London and St. Petersburg to come to an understanding to employ their influence at Washington and in the Confederate States in order to bring about a suspension of hostilities for air months, during which all direct or indirect acts of war should cease both on ace and land" This amounts to so complete 0, recognition and consolidation of the South that the North would be justified in the most brusque rejection of each a proposal. It is not likely, however, that they will have the opportunity of rejecting it. The proposition is believed to have met with but slight encouragement from Russia; and it is to be hoped that our own Government, notwithstanding considerable temptation to accede to it, will decline the Emperor's proposal.

This ensures the re-election to the Senate of Mr. Charles Sumner. In Michigan the Republicans have also triumphed. In Wisconsin the numbers are 00 close that it is as yet impossible to say which party has gained the day. The Republicans attribute their defeat to the absence of their voters at the seat of war and to the popular discontent at the inaction of General M'Clellan, The elections were conducted without disorder.

THE PROPOSED MEDIATION IN AMERIOA.

flcS RaPport's GoweiCtOceet have published the reply which they have returned to the likeoeh deopatrh propoatog a joint offer of mediation in America. We gave to ?or Town Edit l onloat week an obstruct of this able Slate paper. It tools perOpic000ely with the reasons assigned in the dospotcb of p.c. Drocyn ,le tilcoys. Furl Russell recogniem the good Intentions, of the Emperor in making his offer, and he agrees with him that in any nceooore of the kind which it eeaytedesirable to adopt it is extremely deslrehlethat ltnmth should he associated with England andFrance. Up to the preoonttlme,hewever, the queen's qoi'ernmoat hsireuot been informed that the Government of Russia.

have agreed to co-operate with the Western maritime Powers for the pccrpoeu of mediation. The trot and thief question, however, is-Whether the pre posed end con be occomphehod icc the way indicated by the French Emperor? flee Majesty's Government have deliberated anxiously on this onhjoci, and, after weighing all the information which they have rocoivod from from America,

they ore led to the cenoluolen that there is no ground at the present moment to hope that the Federal Government would accept the proposal suggested; and a refusal from Washington, at is remarked, would prevent any speedy renewsi of the utter. The course wbaoh appears bout in the eyes of the Britioh government is, to watch carefully-the progress of opinion in America, and to take advantage of the fret favourable opportunity offered by a choose to

tender friendly counsel.

We do not suppose that any offence has been given to the French Government by the refusal of Lord Russell to interfere in the American struggle. Doubtless the Emperor know beforehand that his application would be made in vain. The despatches have been promptly published, and the French press affects to treat our reply as a mere postponement. We shall lock curiously to see how it is received in Ainarieo. In all probability it will be interpreted as an indication of our malicious wish that the war should go on, or else we shall be complimented upon our prudence in net taking the liberty of advising the cessation of a war which we notoriously stirred up and are feeding with the gold of our aristocracy. Meantime there is not any American news of interest except the reports as to the elections, the principal one-that for New York-having resulted in a grand triumph for those who in an American sense may he called Conservatives. Other victories have also fallen to the Democrats, and their antagonists are driven to exult in the feet that, let public opinion be what it may, Mr. Lincoln and his friends are irremovable. There are, however, rumours of Ministerial changes. General M'Olellan was advancing at last and pouring his force into Virginia, the Confederates apparently making but slight resistance. They may have chosen their own battle-ground. The Alabama continued to sink burn, and destroy, and to excite something more than indignation he the North, which called on the Government to send out a strong naval force to captors her, If, as is reported, she has been burning an English vessel, it is not improbable that orders to our own squadron may save Mr. Lincoln some trouble.
PRESXIDENT L1INCOLN'S COUP-D'ETAT.

I is with Obie reason supposed that there is a. growing body of I

persons in _the States of America which looks at every political and military- rxovement of either of the contending parties from what ' called a mediation point of view. But it is quite certain that in, this country every one, whatever maybe his proo1iviLie, wheth he inclines to the North or t the South scans

eagerly every act of importance which is reported in order, if, possible, to extract from it ome hope, however faint or remote, of a pause in the terribly sanguinary arhitrement to which the differences between Federals and Confederates have been referred. To say' the truth, the' news of American battles has lost much of-- Its interest, since it 'has been invariably found that nothing 'decisive ever comes of them, and that man
kind in general are by no means accurately informed as to

which side even ostensible victory has inclined. Many of those who must gather- their 'opinions from such accounts as they. receive o stricken fields are now apt to think that the resultiess character of this internecine war has become confirmed, and that the questions involved are not 'very likely to be soon settled by the rude process of fighting. It is, therefore, not
surprising that more attention has been recently fixed on the elections which have been going on in the Federal States, and 'which are a kind of battles that Englishmen of the present generation understand bettor than the gladiatorial combats of hundreds of thousands of armed men, the object of which seems to be, or at least the result of which is, only the slaughter of so many of the combatants on either side. It is quite intelligible how the return to Congress and to the offices and Legislatures of the different Federal States of men who belong to a party which, if it has a creed, is opposed, we will not say to the policy, for that word in the sense in which we use it ii hardly expressive of the sources of political movement in America, but to the personal presence in the Presidential chair of Mr. Lincoln, would seem to us on this side of the water to have assumed the aspect of a 'rote of want of confidence - in the Government. In our own more concentrated mode of conducting the business of the State this would have been done by a vote of the House of Commons directed against the Ministry in office, and would have brought new men into their places and raised hopes of the inauguration of a new policy. There is, however, no means that we know of by which a President of the United States can be called onto resign because of the expression of opinion by an elective majority condemnatory of his mode of .onclucting the affairs of the country. No such sudden fall from power can come on Mr. Lincoln except by his own act or by the exorcise of something akin to physical force. But it would be very strange if the fact of strong reaction in public opinion, as indicated by a series of elections carried on avowedly on the principle of Lincolnism or no Lincolnism, did not create an uneasy sense of insecurity at Washington. There has been, doubtless, due counsel taken by the President and his advisers as to how they might best guard themselves from the danger which threatens them. In such a case one of the first steps taken by men who, in a certain sense, are beleaguered, is to eject from amongst them any of their number who, wielding power, are not deemed hc'artwhole in their cause. This is one of the first symptoms of preparation for aef once, and it has not been wanting in the care of the Executive at Washington. The first symptom of alarm has been duly exhibited by the deposition of General M'Clellan from the command of the army in the field, which is really face to face with the Southern forces, a circumstance which would have been of little consequence before the recent elections, but wbich now is full of significance.  -

 This act, if it means anything, signifies that the autliosities at Washington are conscious that, the party of which they are the representatives is no longer triumphant, and that while Mr. Lincoln continues to hold power, it may be in defiance of opinion, it is necessary that he should

-use it in every way for the purposes and the support of the cause of which he s the outward and visible sign. We in this country are generally in a somewhat foggy state on the subject .1 American parties; and, few of us comprehend exactly what

is meant by the terms Republican and Democrat. If the latter is interpreted by the word Conservatism we believe it goes as

rear to its meaning as it can be brought; but it has a strange

sound to our cars when used in that sense. It would seem, bewever, that the Democrats are the party of Jaw and order; earnest for the preservation of the Union, if it can be preserved by legitimate and constitutional means; and up to the present time they have not been opposed to war as a means of conserving the grand federation of the United States. The Republicans, as we understancithem, areabolitionists of slavery and Unionists at any cost and by any means, and therefore they are supporters of all the recent acts of the Executive at Washington, which have made Old-World despotism and European states of siege hide their diminished heads. Hitherto, the Democrats have not been a peace party; but it is believed that they are fast coming to that conclusion, and, are-we will mot say drifting-but being driven into the consciousness that separation between North and South is inevitable, and that it would be better to yield their wishes for the totality of the Union in order that anarchy might not become chronic in their

 will be attained in which the small voice of reason and of

the Lidian summer has arrived, and it will afford opportunity

than a victory, which should ruh the power of the South. Hence his dilatory proceedings, his apparent dallying with the war, his reluctance to measure his strength at all opportunities with the foe before him, and the conduct of the campaign in Virginia, which ended in the withdrawal of the Northern troops from aggressive action in the territory of their opponents. In short, the accusation must be summed up in the simple phrase that lifClellan was a traitor. For our own part, we believe nothing so decided of him. He is a mediocre man, a doctrinaire in a military as well as a political sense, who might have been well employed in finding recruits at Washington, but who was wholly unfitted by temperament or quality to be placed in the situation of a General on whose activity, resource, and military genius so uch depended.

It is tree that the extreme section of the Northern party has long been demanding his deposition from the command of the army of the Potomac; and it may be true that on more than' one occasion the President has personally written to his General, remonstrating with him for his military conduct; and there may also be truth in the statement of General Halleck, of something like positive disobedience to orders by M'Clellan, and which is put forward as the ostensible reason of his -recall; but there axe few impartial persons who will not hold that the real cause of his removal lies deeper, and that the sudden action of the President has been prompted by a very excusable alarm at the turn which political affairs have taken. If all that is stated be fact, the President was long ago satisfied that MCClellan ought to be removed, and, if so,-his being retained could only have been a temporising with that feeling of insecurity which has culminated in an act almost of desperation, The quiet submission of M'Clellan to his relegation, with something of ignominy, into private life, when, if his partisans are to be credited, he might have set himself up as a military dictator and brought the affairs of his country to a settlement, is characteristic of the man, whom a mixture of constitutional principle and timidity renders wholly unequal to the adopting of the part.which has been played before now in the civil convulsions of a nation by the bead of an army. Despite of some peculiarly American talk with regard to him, we venture to prophecy that the world has heard the last of M'Clellan as a public man.  -

The appointment of General Buruside to the command of the Northern army is perhaps the best that could be made. He is by profession a soldier, and he has been tolerably successful in some small affairs in which he has been engaged. But, whatever his military capabilities may be, what seems to be certain is that he has undertaken the command of the army of the Potomac on the condition of meeting the enemy in the field; that his tactics are to be the opposite of those of his predecessor. It seems likely, therefore, that ore long a state of things will be attained in which the small voice of reason and of good sense, which is very faintly heard in America now, will swell into a demand for peace and negotiation. We hear that that peculiar season of the American continent which is called the Indian summer has arrived, and it will afford opportunity for General Burnside to do anything he proposes to do; and if a great battle is fouaiot, whatever may be its result in a military sense, we have a confident hope that its effects on the public mind in the States will be what we should call satinlactory-that is, it will produce such a pause in the action of he war as to allow the suggestions of reason and common ;eoase to be listened to, coining, as they will, from an unlookedor quarter-namely, from the majority of the American people themselves.
To the Democrat patty General M'Olellan avowedly belongs. When he took the command-in-chief of the army of the North such a position was quite consistent with the principles of his party, and he might well have believed that he was best serving

its views by endeavouring to create an army out of the armed

snob which he found at Washington. Whatever other merit nay be denied him, and we do not profess to hold his qnalitie

:as a General in the field at all high, at least he must be

.gtiowed the credit of having done much towards that organi. cation of a huge mass of men called an army, the absence o+ whiuh in general has been the main element of all the disaster

of this unhappy war. But it was not unreasonable for the President and his advisers to suppose that the change which had gowe over MOlellan's party would reach hint, and this at the rnost,critieal moment of the contest. In fact, it is on all 9iands. allowed that he held the issue of the struggle in his Thsnds ;, and4hat, once more in the history of the world, the Gcoeral of. an1army might have been the arbiter of the fortunes of his, country. That an attempt to remove him from his cootenipdshonldhave been made is not surprising; and the moral courage.which dictated and carried it out is not undeserving *f admiration.

The ctse of the epub]ioans against M'Clellan, however, goes fuith 1au that wtioh we have stated above. They say that, as i pcilitlian his sapathies have always been with the South, end that ha has belieyed that party wronged by Northern sentiment and Northern action that he hoped and believed that a time would come when the war could be arrested, and when the Southern leaders, backed by a powerful party in the Northern States, would listen to terms o$ accommodation; and that notbhag WQ14c1MUdUa the way of sqek' a compromise mere
