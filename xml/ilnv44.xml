<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War Intelligence.</hi></p>
<p>We have news from New York to the morning of the 19th ult. The
information respecting the war movements may be briefy summarised.</p>
<p>General Langstreet, who does not appear to have been retreating
with any hot haste from Knoxville, turned upon the pursuing Federals
on the 14th and drove them back some distance with considerable
loss. The latest accounts were to the effect that fighting was still
going on at a point described as Blair's crossroads.</p>
<p>The Federals are said to have abandoned Lookout Mountain
Missionary Ridge, and other points, from which General Grant recently
drove the Confederates.</p>
<p>Hardee's army is estimated at 35,000 strong, and is at Dalton, with
pickets extending to the tunnel. Wheeler is reorganising cavalry at
Dalton for an active winter campaign. Grant and Sherman have left
Chattanooga for Bridgenorth.</p>
<p>The famous Confederate guerilla leader, Morgan, who recently made
his escape from a Federal prison, had, it is said, succeeded in
getting across the Tennessee, but not, it would seem, without
considerable difficulty and risk, as it is affirmed that sixteen of
his escort were captured.</p>
<p>There is no news of importance from the army of the
Potomac. Mosby's and White's guerillas are very troublesome and
numerous, continually harassing the outposts. On the 13th 700 of them
made a dash at the bridge across Cedar Run, near Catlett's station,
but were driven back by the force guarding the bridge. The line of the
railroad from the front to Alexandria is hereafter to be well
protected by both cavalry and infantry. Short leaves of absence are
freely granted to officers and men. There is nothing further in relation to the removal of General Meade. It is reported that he has
demanded a court of inquiry into the conduct of the late campaign.</p>
<p>General Stuart, at the head of a force of Confederate cavalry, had
made a raid upon the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, near Fairfax,
and, besides capturing a number of prisoners, he destroyed about two
miles of the line of railway.</p>
<p>A despatch from General Butler at Fortress Monroe announces that a
portion of his force, under General Wistar, had succeeded in capturing
the Confederate garrison at Charles City crossroads on the James
River. Eight officers and over eighty Confederate soldiers were
taken. The Federal forces, to accomplish this, had marched seventy-two
miles in fifty-four hours, mostly in a severe storm.</p>
<p>A brigade of coloured troops under General Wild occupied Elizabeth
City, North Carolina, on the 10th of of December. The inhabitants were
entirely taken by surprise, and offered no resistance. Twenty
waggon-loads of contraband goods were sent back to Portsmouth by
General Wild. It is said that Elizabeth City is to be made the base
of important operations.</p>
<p>The Federals were throwing a large number of shells into
Charleston, replied to by the Confederate batteries. An accidental
fire had occured in Fort Sumter, killing ten and injuring thirty
men. a storm had so seriously injured the obstructions to the harbour
that it was thought the Federal fleet would be able to make its way
through them.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">the Ironclads.</hi></p>
<p>The official reports of the commanders of the monitors engaged in
Dupont's attack on Charleston express disappointment at their capacity
to overcome strong forts, and state that if the attack had been
prolonged the monitors would all have been disabled. One commander
says he was disappointed beyond measure at the experiment of monitors
overcoming strong forts, and considers it was a fair
trial.</p><p>Captain Drayton, of the Passive, says:--</p>
<q><p>I was struck in quick succession in the lower part of the
turret by two heavy shots, which bulged	in its plates and beams, and
forcing together the rails on which the carriage of the 11-inch gun
worked, rendered it wholly useless for the remainder of the action. A
little after a very heavy rifle-shot struck the upper edge of the
turret, broke all its eleven heavy plates, and then, glancing upwards,
struck the pilot-house with such force as to send it over, open the
plates, and squeeze out the top, exposing the inside of the
pilot-house, and rendering it extremely likely that the next shot
would take of the top entirely.</p></q>
<p>Captain Rodgers, of the Weehawken, reports:--</p>
<q><p>Two or three heavy shots struck the side armour near the same
place. They so broke the iron that it only remained in splintered
fragments, much of which could be picked of by hand, and the wood was
exposed. the deck was pierced so as to make a hole, through which
water ran into the vessel; thirty-six bolts were broken in the turret,
and a great many in the pilot-house. To the Patapsco, on damage was
done which disabled her, although injuries which she received, if
multiplied, would do so. Forty bolts in the funnel were broken. After
the third shot from the 15-inch gun of the Nantuck a port-stopper
became jammed, several shots striking very near the port and driving
in the plating. It was not used again. A number of these same plates
were started so much that another shot in their vicinity would have
knocked them off. The deck plates were cut in twelve places; one shot
cut through the iron and about two inches into the beam, starting the
plates, several bolts, and the planking, for some feet below. The
plates pm the side armour of the Nahant were badly broken in several
places, and one, where struck by two shots in close proximity, partly
stripped from the wood, and the wood backing broken in, with edging of
back plates started up and rolled back in places. The deck was struck
twice damagingly, one shot near the propeller-wheel quite shattering
and tearing the plate in its passage, and starting up twenty-five
bolts in the turret. There were marks of nine shots; fifty-six of the
bolts were broken perceptibly, the heads flying off inside the turret,
and the bolts starting almost their length outside, some of them
flying out completely, and being found at a considerable distance from
the turret, on the deck. One shot struck the upper part of the turret,
breaking through every plate. The pilot-house was much damaged and
wrecked, and four more such shots as it received would have demolished
it. One shot at the base broke every plate through, and evidently
nearly penetrated it.</p></q>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal House of Representatives has passed a resolution, by 93
to 64, that the war should be prosecuted so long as the rebels are
found in arms. A motion, submitted by the Hon. Fernando Wood,
requesting the President to appoint two commissioners to negotiate
with the authorities at Richmond with the view of terminating the war
and restoring the Union upon the terms of equity, fraternity, and
equality under the Constitution, was tabled--i.e., thrown aside--by a
vote of 98 against 59. All the Democratic members except five voted
for its adoption, and the large minority in its favour has created
some sensation.</p>
<p>Resolutions have been introduced for a new reciprocity treaty with
Canada; also to inquire into the expediency of putting coloured
soldiers on the same footing as white men as regards pay, and of
abolishing the 300 dols. draught commutation.</p>
<p>A bill has been introduced in the the Senate prohibiting the sale
of gold, silver, or exchange through brokers unless the whole of the
purchase-money be paid down, under the penalty of a heavy fine and
imprisonment.</p>
<p>A banquet to both Houeoe of Congress has been given on board the
Russian fleet at Washington. The Russian Minister and the Speaker of
the House of Representatives made speeches.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has nominated General
Grant as candidate for the next presidency, and has put forward an
electioneering cry that he would demand from England an	indemnity for
the depredations of privateers, and would expel the French from
Mexico.</p>
<p>An "Evening Exchange" has been opened in the heart of the
handsomest quarter of New York, to which, after a hastily-snatched
dinner, crowds of brokers and speculators eagerly hurry, there to resume the transactions of the day and to anticipate those of the
morrow.</p>
<p>There have been several rumours of peace proposals coming from the
South lately, but nothing of the kind has appeared as yet.</p>
<p>The Confederate Senate has, in conformity with the recommendation
of President Davis, passed a bill prohibiting the employment of
substitutes in the Confederate army.</p>
<p>Mr. Foote, from Tennessee, of the Confederate House of Representatives, in a speech of the 11th ult., casts the whole blame of the
 fall of Vicksburg and the Confederate reverses in East Tennessee upon
President Davis for retaining Generals Pemberton and Bragg in
command.</p>
<p>The Richmond press denounces President Lincoln's amnesty
proclamation as an infamous document, which will but arouse the
Southern people to new zeal and new efforts.</p>
<p>The Federal steamer Ella Annie has recaptured the Chesapeake, with
three of her crew, in Sambro Harbour, Nova Scotia. The Chesapeake was
taken to Halifax for judicial decision. No resistance was offered by
the crew, all of whom, except three, escaped to the shore. The English
authorities in Nova Scotia had forbidden the furnishing of coals to
the Chesapeake by the people of that province; they had ordered her
detention wherever she appeared, and gave the information to the
Federals which led to her capture. It is also alleged that they have
ordered the arrest of the men who seized her while going in her as
passengers, holding them to have been guilty of piracy. Mr. Seward has
had a friendly interview with Lord Lyons on the subject.</p>
<p>The Federal brig Perry has been captured near Charleston. The
steamer Ceres was destroyed off Beaufort.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PAMPERO.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> vessel, launched a short time ago
from the building-yard of Messrs. J. G. Thomson, Glasgow, has created
a good deal of interest, owing to a suspicion being pretty generally
entertained that it was intended to make her a consort to the Alabama,
Georgia, and Florida. Shortly after being launched, the Emancipation
Society at Glasgow addressed a memorial to Earl Russell, stating that
they had reasons for supposing her to be for that service, and praying
for an investigation into the matter. To this Earl Russell replied
that the attention of her Majesty's Government had already been
directed to this vessel. No interference with the vessel took place
beyond posting customs officers near her berth and moving from
Greenock the gun-boat Goldfinch, one of the tenders to her Majesty's
ship Hogue, stationed there, and placing her on the opposite side of
the harbour to the Pampero. Recently the Lord Advocate of Scotland
instructed the customs authorities to detain her, and she is now in
charge of a gang of bluejackets. The Pampero is a handsome steamer of
1000 tons, builder's measurement; length, 230 ft.; beam, 32 ft.;
depth, 20 ft.; with direct-acting engines of 200-horse power. She is
finely sparred, and her	main and foremasts, of iron, are capable of
spreading a large area of canvas. Her funnel is telescopic. She has
lifting screw, and patent reefing topsails. Our Engraving of the
Pampero is from a sketch by Mr. Hugh Aird, of Glasgow.</p></div2>

<p>....Englishmen must be wicked in the American eye, and there can be
no peace for them or with them. Unhappily, the latest aggravation
given comes from our own Government. It is the case of the Victor,  an
Admiralty ship of six guns, which was sold to some private individual,
fitted out by Chatham Dockyard workmen, and finally got clear off, as
the Rappahannock, Confederate States' cruiser. Anything more unhappy,
more ludicrous, cannot be conceived. Of course, it was never intended,
but it looks very much as if our great men were so tired after the
labour of delaying the steam-rams in the Mersey that there was no more
energy amongst then to look after Victors and Rappahannocks. Within a
fortnight there will be another supply of the choicest Sewardian
scolding, and passionate threats from certain New York organs. And
then there will be Lord Russell's reply, and promises, already once
broken, never to do the like again. And all this in face of General
Grant's standing for the presidency, with a popular "platform," or
"ticket," of sworn warfare with England unless reparation be made for
fifty thousand incomprehensible things. The workmen, said to have been
officially employed,  are all to be dismissed, nominally for being
absent without leave: but, in reality, for having been as careless as
Government itself in breaking international laws.</p></div2>

of the many floating palaces on the Hudson River, while on her way
from New York to Albany, caught fire near Fort Washington, from the
bursting of one of her boilers, on Saturday, the 5th ult., and was
burnt to the water's edge. All attempts to extinguish the flames
proved unavailing. It was impossible, owing to the dense smoke and
steam on the lower deck, to get at the hose, and the heat drove the
engineer from his post. The Isaac Newton had on board, at the time of
the accident, about 130 passengers. A tug and a propeller hastened to
the relief of those on board, who were speedily removed from the
burning wreck. Fourteen persons were, however, badly scalded by the
steam, and of these six died. Our Engraving is from a sketch taken by
Mr. Edward L. Henry, of Tenth-street, New York.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to December 26. Everything was quiet to
that date in the army of the Potomac. The troops were settling down
into comfortable winter quarters. Nothing of importance was known to
have occured recently in General Lee's army. A slight skirmish took
place on the 20th ult. between a small body of guerrillas and some of
Gregg's cavalry, near Morgansburg. The Confederates retreated after a
few shots were exchanged.</p>
<p>General Longstreet had inflicted a check on a body of Federals at
Bear Station, and was reported to be contemplating fresh operations;
but it was said that his railway communication with Richmond had been
more or less obstructed by a successful "raid" made on the Virginia
and Tennessee Railway by the Federal General Averill.</p>
<p>General Joe Johnston	was moving to reinforce Hardee, and was, it is
said, to take the command of the Southern army in Georgia.</p>
<p>The Confederates in Arkansas were reported to be about to attack
Little Rock, but they had sustained a repulse in an attempt on the
outposts of Fort Gibson.</p>
<p>General Rosecranz is to supersede General Schofield in
Missouri.</p>
<p>The bombardment of Charleston continued. It had been reported that
several monitors and the iron-clad frigate Ironsides had become
entangled in the obstructions placed in Charleston Harbour, and were
in a very dangerous position; but it had susequently been declared
that there was no foundation for the report.</p>
<p>There was a rumour at New Orleans that a mutiny had broken out
among the coloured troops in Fort Jackson. The Federals had abandoned
the Teche country.</p>
<p>There is no news of importance from Texas. Generals Banks and Kirby
Smith were exchanging prisoners.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal Congress have voted 20,000,000 dols. for bounties and
advance pay to volunteers, and passed a vote against submitting the
legality of the Conscription Act to the Supreme Court.</p><pb n="27"/>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has commenced a
systematic attack upon President Lincoln, saying that his fatuity and
imbecility, where his personal partialities are concerned, pass all
belief, and that he is an amiable sort of man, but his works are too
costly.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary Stanton states in his report to President Lincoln,
that up to midsummer last there had been issued to the Federal troops
by the War Department since the present war began, 1,550,576 muskets
and rifles for foot soldiers, 327,170 carbines and pistols for mounted
troops, 271,817 sabres, 1,745,586 cannon balls and shells, 50,045,515
lb. of lead and lead bullets, 2,274,490 cartridges for artillery,
378,584,104 cartridges for small arms, 715,036,470 percussion-caps,
6,082,505 friction primers, 13,071,073 lb. of gunpowder, 1,680,220
sets of accoutrements for infantry, and 196,298 for cavalry.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan was adopted as a candidate at the next
presidential election by a meeting of the Conservative Union National
Committee, held at Philadelphia on the 23rd ult. Judge Campbell was
nominated for the vice-presidency.</p>
<p>General Burnside is in New York, receiving much public
attention.</p>
<p>General Corcoran has been killed by a fall from his
horse.</p>
<p>The passport system for passengers leaving by American vessels has
been revived.</p>
<p>Federal war-vessels have been stationed off the Narrows to overhaul
vessels leaving New York.</p>
<p>The English barque Circassian has been seized at New York by the
Provost Marshal, and many arrests, both male and female, have been
made on board.</p>
<p>Advices from fortress Monroe state that General Butler has issued
an order for enrolling all ablebodied citizens, white and coloured,
between the ages of eighteen and forty-five in his department.</p>
<p>At the ceremony of turning the first sod of the Atlantic and
Pacific Railway, in Nebraska, Mr. Poppleton, of Omaha, citizen and
promoter of the railway, thus addressed the
assembly:--"Fellow-citizens of Omaha and Council Bluffs,--On the 13th
day of October, 1854, about seven o'clock in the evening, I was set
down by the Western Stage Company at yonder city of Council Bluffs. At
the rising of the sun on the following morning I climbed to the summit
of one of the bluffs which overlook that prosperous and enterprising
town, and took one long and lingering look across the Missouri at the
beautiful site on which now sits, in the full vigour of business,
social and religious life, the youthful but thriving, and this day
jubilant, city of Omaha. Early in the day I crossed the river, and
along a narrow path, cut by some stalwart man through the tall, rank,
prairie grass, I wended my way in search of the post-office. At length
I found an old pioneer seated, apparently in solitary rumination, upon
a piece of hewn timber, and inquired of him for the post-office. He
replied that he was the postmaster, and would examine the office for
my letters, Thereupon he removed from his head a hat, to say the least
of it, somewhat veteran in appearance, and drew from its cavernous
depths the coveted letters. On that day the wolves and the Omahas were
the almost undisputed lords of the soil, and the entire postal system
of the city was conducted in the crown of this venerable hat! To-day,
at least 4000 radiant faces gladden our streets, and the postal
service, sheltered by a costly edifice, strikes its Briarien arms
towards the north, the south, the east, and the west, penetrating
regions then unexplored and unknown, and bearing the symbols of values
then hidden in the mountains and beneath the streams of which the
world in its wildest vagaries had never dreamed."--Mr. Train took a
prominent part in the celebration, making a speech in which he was
unsparing in his abuse of England. The <hi
rend="italic">Republican</hi>, speaking of Mr. Train's appearance,
says, "By special request of the ladies, Mr. T. mounted a buggy, threw
off his overcoat, laid down his hat, rolled up his sleeves, and in
another moment the steam was on, and he was under full headway."</p>
<p>The Governor of Texas had issued a message declaring that there can
be no peace until the Southern Confederacy shall have been
recognised.</p>
<p>A correspondence between Jefferson Davis and the Pope has been
published. The two eminent personages are charmingly courteous to each
other. Mr. Davis informs the Pope that the laws of the Southern
Confederacy ensure to every one the enjoyment of his temporal rights
and the free exercise of his religion. He presumes, no doubt, that the
Pope has never heard of the negro population. Mr. Davis finally prays
that Heaven may prolong the Pope's days, The Pope, in return, prays
that the God of pity may shed upon Davis the light of His grace.</p>
<p>It is stated in the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Enquirer</hi> that
Jefferson Davis will soon make a decided change in the whole
Government, and also in the army.</p>
<p>The substitute system has been abrogated in the Confederate
Congress.</p>
<p>The steamer Vanderbilt has captured the barque Saxon off Cape Town,
and the Angela Pequina on the West Coast of Africa. The schooner
J. L. Gerity, which left Matamoras on Nov. 16 with a cargo of cotton
and six passengers, was captured at sea by the passengers, who
overpowered the captain and crew and set them adrift in an open
boat. After two days they landed at Sisal.</p></div2>

Liverpool, for 1863, the emigration from that port, when compared with
1862, is greatly on the increase. The total number of steerage
passengers sailling "under the Act" was 119,772, and of cabin
passengers 3765; making a total of 123,537. Added to this there are
the passengers carried out in the short ships, which number 14,445;
making a grand total of 137,982. When compared with last year, there
is an increase of 76,668. The tide of emigration is principally
accelerated by the enormous Irish emigration to America, which appears
to increase daily. It is also a fact that the Irish emigrants are much
better clothed than those whose homes have been in England or
Scotland. This is attributed to the high pay now being given to
labourers in the United States.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> town of Brownsville lies on the Texan
bank of the Rio Grand (or Rio Bravo) del Norte, about two miles from
Matamoros, a town of some note in Mexico, on the south side of the
river. Although built almost entirely of wood, Brownsville has a neat
and bright appearance. There was a considerable Confederate garrison
at this place; but the inhabitants, having, on Monday, Nov. 2, 1863,
received information of the arrival of a fleet of Federal transports
off Brazos, Santiago, began immediately to evacuate the town; and for
two days every means of transit across the Rio Grande was crowded to
excess with goods, furniture, cotton, and baggage; while upon both
banks were piled in confused heaps bedding, cotton bales, luggage,
vehicles, and merchandise of every description. About three o'clock
p.m. on Tuesday, the 3rd ult., the military authorities retreated,
after burning the garrison buildings, the cotton, and all public
stores they were not able to remove. On the 6th ult. the Federals,
under command of General Banks, took quiet possession of the
place.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Chesapeake, Captain Willet,
screw-steamer, of 460 tons, one of a line of freight and passenger
steamers sailing between New York and Portland, Maine, left New York
on the 5th ult., on her regular trip to Portland. At one o'clock
a.m. on the 6th ult., when about twenty miles N.N.E. of Cape Cod, she
was seized by a party of Confederates, who had taken passage on her
for Portland. The second engineer, who was in charge of the engine at
the time, was shot dead and his body thrown overboard. The first
engineer was wounded by a ball in the chin, and was kept on board to
work the engine. The first mate was also wounded, but not dangerously;
and although several shots were fired at the captain he was fortunate
enough to escape without even getting a wound. After the crew had been
overpowered, the vessel was taken charge of by the Confederates; the
captain, officers, and crew were placed in irons, and the passengers,
some six or eight in number, on promising not to interfere, were
allowed their liberty. The Confederates numbered sixteen persons, and
were commanded by a Lieutenant Braine, reputed to hold a commission in
the Confederate service. Among the passengers was a man belonging to
St. John, N.B., who, on its being ascertained that he was acquainted
with the navigation of the Bay of Fundy, was forced by Braine to act
as pilot. On the night of the 8th ult. the Chesapeake arrived off
Musquash Harbour, where she was boarded by a person, said to be a
Confederate officer, who assumed the command of the steamer. A passing
pilot-boat, "The Simonds," was hailed, the pilot was compelled to come
on board, and the boat was taken in tow. The passengers, captain,
officers, and crew of the Chesapeake were landed at this place, and
arrived at St. John, New Brunswick, on the morning of the 9th
ult. This incident forms the subject of our Illustration on the
preceding page, from a sketch by Mr. Charles C. Ward, of St. John. The
Chesapeake then steamed up to Partridge Island, at the mouth of the
Harbour of St. John, where the man who had acted as pilot was landed,
and the vessel sailed away.</p>
<p>The Chesapeake has been subsequently recaptured by the Federal
steamer Ella Annie, in Sambro Harbour, Nova Scotia. The Chesapeake was
taken to Halifax for judicial decision. No resistance was offered by
the crew, all of whom, except three, escaped to the shore. The English
authorities in Nova Scotia had forbidden the furnishing of coals to
the Chesapeake by the people of that province; they had ordered her
detention wherever she appeared, and gave the information to the
Federals which led to her capture. It is also alleged that they have
ordered the arrest of the men who seized her while going in her as
passengers, holding them to have been guilty of piracy.</p>
<p>We learn by the last mail that the three pirates captured on board
the Chesapeake were taken from the authorities by the mob whilst being
landed at Halifax, and set free.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Great Waterfall</hi>.--A detachment of
troops recently scouting in the valley of the Snake or Lewis fork of
the Columbia discovered a waterfall which, it is said, is entitled to
the distinction of being called the greatest in the world. The entire
volume of Snake River pours over a sheer precipice 198 ft. high, 38
ft. higher than Niagara. Snake River is fully as large as the Niagara,
and the cascade is one solid sheet or body. The locality of this
immense waterfall is near the point heretofore designated as the Great
Shoshone or Salmon Falls of that river, but they have always been
enveloped in mystery. Almost a dozen years ago the writer passed along
the Snake River road. For two days we heard the roaring of these
falls, but learned no more respecting them than if they had been in
the moon. It was said that there were a series of falls and rapids,
making a descent of 700 ft. in seven miles, and the sound gave colour
to the report. For hundreds of miles across the great plain Snake
River flows through a canon, with vertical walls hundreds of feet
high. It is only at long intervals that salient points are found by
which the river can be reached. The road crosses from point to point
of the bends, only approaching close to the river where there is a
chance to descend for water. From these facts very few, if any, of the
tens of thousands of adventurers that have crossed the plains have
ever looked upon the great falls. The late discoverers report, beside
the main cataract, many others of less height, varying from 20 ft. to
50 ft. each, near by. Some day they will be visited by the tourist and
pleasure-seeker, and looked upon as frequently and familiarly as
Niagara is today; and it will be admitted that, with the stupendous
grandeur of their surroundings, they are as far beyond Niagara as
Niagara now excels the balance of the world.--<hi rend="italic">New

<p>The Massachusetts volunteers, under the Bounty Act just published
by the General Court, will be the best paid troops in the world. The
amount of bounty and pay to be received for three years' service, by a
soldier who has previously been in the army nine months or more, if he
has a family of not less than three persons dependent on his labour
for support, is as follows:--United States' bounty, 402 dols.; the
Commonwealth's bounty, 325 dols.; pay, 468 dols.; rations, 324 dols.;
clothing, 126 dols.; aid to family, 432 dols.--total, 2077 dols. If,
instead of 325 dols. in hand from the State, he accepts the offer of

<p>The History of Steam Navigation is yet to be written. New facts, or
novel versions of old facts, are repeatedly turning up, so as to
affect claims of priority. Last year three papers were read to the
Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society--1, " On the
Introduction of Steam Navigation;" 2 and 3, "Note on Two Events in the
History," &#x0026;c.; and there cropped up the following paragraph:--
<q><p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Steam-Boat in 1788</hi>.--In a letter
from Dr. Franklin to Dr. Ingenhauz, dated Philadelphia, Oct. 24, 1788,
the Doctor remarks:--We have no philosophical news here at present,
except that a boat moved by a steam-engine rows itself against tide in
our river, and it is apprehended the construction may be so simplified
and improved as to become generally useful."</p></q>
In going over the ground of the history, even practised writers are
continually stumbling. The other day a reviewer, in the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi>, referred to a statement that, "three
centuries ago, Blasco de Garay attempted to propel a boat by steam in
the harbour of Barcelona." To this a Correspondent has replied as
follows:--
<q><p>The evidence cited by the Spaniards for this assertion, often
repeated, is a letter from Blasco himself, written in A.D. 1543.</p>
<p>By permission of the Queen of Spain, but after much hindrance, I
was enabled to inspect this letter, now preserved with the Archives at
Simancas, near Valladolid, and there is not one word about steam in
the document. Blasco describes minutely a vessel propelled by paddles
worked by 200 men.</p>
<p>The first well authenticated instance of a steam-boat actually used
is found in the manuscript correspondence between Leibnitz and Papin,
in the Royal Library at Hanover, where Papin relates his experiments
with a model steam-boat on the River Fulda in the year 1707. Next, in
1783, De Jouffroy in France and Fitch in America used steam-boats
experimentally. The first practically successful steam-boat was worked
in 1787 by Mr. Miller, of Dalswinton, in
Scotland....</p></q></p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the North American we have news from New York to
the afternoon of Jan. 9.</p>
<p>There had been some skirmishes and minor engagements in Western
Virginia and in the neighbourhood of Winchester, and their result
seems to have been generally advantageous to the Confederates. At
Chattanooga all was quiet, and General Joseph Johnstone was understood
to be actively reorganising the Confederate army in the neighbourhood
of Dalton. An expedition sailed from New Orleans on the 30th ult., and
although its destination was not positively known, it was supposed
that the forces would at first proceed to Pensacola, and would
ultimately operate against Mobile. On Christmas Day the Federals
bombarded Charleston with great effect. The Confederates erected a
battery on Stono River, and did considerable damage to the gun-boat
Marble Head. Two other gun-boats went to her assistance, drove the
enemy from the battery, and captured it.</p>
<p>Everything shows the determination of the North to prosecute the
war to the utmost. President Lincoln and his Cabinet recommended
Congress to offer liberal bounties to volunteers up to the end of
February, as the suspension of bounties had almost stopped
recruiting. Mr. Wilson has consequently introduced a bill, offering
bounties of 400 dols. to re-enlisting volunteers, 300 dols. to new
volunteers, and 100 dols. to negro recruits. A resolution to the
effect that 1,000,000 volunteers should be called out for ninety days,
and should be placed under General Grant's command, had been referred
for consideration to the Senate's Military Committee. The House of
Representatives had passed a resolution declaring that any proposal
for negotiation with the "rebels" should be immediately and
unhesitatingly rejected. Mr. Lincoln has been nominated for
re-election as President, and his reappointment has been urged in the
House of Representatives. The ground alleged in the latter case was
that his election would ensure emancipation throughout the Union. In
the same connection, the Governor of Maryland, in his message to the
State Legislature, has urged that steps should be taken to push
forward gradual emancipation in the State. A delegation of citizens
had left Arkansas for Washington to arrange for their State
re-entering the Union.</p>
<p>Governor Seymour, in his message to the New York Legislature, had
recommended measures for the protection of the State banks against the
new national banks, had denounced the draught as a failure, and had
declared that President Lincoln had assumed powers which subordinated
the laws to military authority. The Governor declares that the country
can only be saved from ruin by the Administration adhering to its
pledge to restore constitutional union. The Republican press are
incensed against the message. The <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi> declares that Governor Seymour's sympathies are with
rebellion. The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> denounces him
as a traitorous and malignant enemy of his country.</p>
<p>Extensive shipments from New York to the South have come to light,
and more arrests have been made.</p>
<p>A letter recently intercepted by the War Department disclosed the
fact that W. E. Hilton, a printer in New York, was engaged, under
contract with the Southern Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, in
furnishing notes, bonds, &#x0026;c., to the South, and that he was
about to proceed to Richmond to superintend a printing and engraving
establishment. Hilton was arrested and consigned to Fort Lafayette. In
his possession were found six million dollars in Confederate bonds
ready for signature.</p>
<p>Archbishop Hughes was buried in New York with great ceremony on the
7th inst. An immense concourse of people was present. The law courts
and numerous places of business were closed.</p>
<p>Four negroes called at the Executive mansion, Washington, on
New-Year's Day, and were presented to Mr. Lincoln. This is the first
occurrence of the kind.</p>
<p>Signal stations, occupied by a small garrison, are to be
established along the Mississippi for the protection of the
navigation, in accordance with a recommendation from President Lincoln
and the Secretary for War.</p>
<p>The Federals have constructed upwards of 5000 miles of military
telegraph, and the Secretary for War states that in the course of last
year at least 1,200,000 telegrams were sent along these lines--about
3300 a day.</p>
<p>The City of Baltimore was intercepted off Cape Race on the 2nd.</p>

<p>A contract for the construction of a tunnel, extending two miles
under Lake Michigan, at Chicago, for the purpose of supplying the city
with pure water, has been awarded; the lowest bid for completing the
tunnel being 315,130 dollars. The contract is for a tunnel of five
feet internal diameter, lined with brick. The tunnel is to be
excavated thirty-five feet below the bed of the lake, and to have four
feet of dip landwards. Strainers will be fixed over the outlet to keep
out the fish. The total area of the tunnel will be nearly twenty
square feet, an area amply large enough to furnish water continuously
to a city five or six times the size of Chicago in the present
day.</p>
<p>The Confederate cruiser Florida is said to have completed her
repairs and alterations at Brest, and to be ready to put to sea. Her
recent trial-trip was most satisfactory, and she is reported to be in
a high state of efficiency. Captain Maurice Richard, her new
commander, has waited on the Vice-Admiral of the port and other local
authorities to take official leave of them, and no doubt the Florida
will sail shortly. The Kearsage, Federal frigate, still mounts guard
outside the port of Brest, and a fight is looked forward to with
considerable certainty. Captain Richard expresses himself confident of
being able to give a good account of himself and his ship, and has, it
is stated, written to the Federal commander that he is prepared to
accept a combat with him outside the limits of French
waters.</p></div2>

<p>An Irish American, named Feeny, is actively engaged in Galway in
getting labourers for a railroad in the Federal States. He offers
eight shillings a day and other advantages to his recruits on arriving
at their "destination;" but where that may be is not very clear. He
has had great success, and in two or three days enrolled five hundred
men. He has been arrested under the Foreign Enlistment Act, in
Loughrea, on suspicion of enlisting for the Federal army, but, as no
proof could be had, he was acquitted.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Highat, a member of the firm of Messrs. Jones and Co.,
ship-chandlers, Liverpool, was charged before the stipendiary
magistrate of that borough, yesterday week, with an offence against
the Foreign Enlistment Act. The specific charge against Mr. Highat was
that he had been concerned in the enlistment of men for service on
board the Confederate cruiser Georgia. The witnesses for the
prosecution were four men who served for a short time on board that
ship, but who are now employed at a weekly salary by a private
detective, who seems to be one of the Attach&#x00E9;s of the United
States Consulate at Liverpool. Mr. Highat was bound over in his own
recognizances and two sureties to appear to answer any charge which
may be preferred against him at the next Assizes.</p></div2>

River, the entrance to Wilmington, North Carolina. I was down there
one night, and, as it is twenty-five miles from the town, it was
impossible to get back that night, so I had to rough it in a casemate
till morning. As luck would have it, we discovered a blockade-running
steamer, the Hansa, under our guns at dawn, and at the same time the
Yankee blockaders also became aware of her presence and opened fire,
thinking, as she had already got inside the bar (the line of white
breakers just seaward of her), they would destroy her before she made
the inlet. To get within range they had to expose themselves to the
metal of the fort, which soon drove them off, leaving the Hansa at
liberty to make her way safely into the river. The distant point of
land is Cape Fear. Fort Fisher is one of the strongest coast defences
I have seen, not excepting any of those at Charleston, that have
hitherto held an entire iron-clad fleet at bay."</p></div2>

<p>There is nothing important in the latest news from New
York. Generals Lee, Johnston, and Longstreet were assiduously engaged
in recruiting and reorganising the Confederate armies under their
respective commands; and General Longstreet was said to occupy a
position within twenty miles of Knoxville. General Meade, in a speech
which he had made in Philadelphia, had declared that active operations
would be recommenced in Virginia as soon as the weather and the season
permitted.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi> correspondent adds to the above
intelligence that General Stuart, with 5000 Confederate cavalry, had
again passed round General Meade on the night of the 14th inst. The
object of this movement is believed to be to sever either the
Alexandria and Orange or the Baltimore and Ohio Railways. The Federal
authorities are said to be fully prepared to prevent material damage
to either.</p>
<p>General Lee, under date of the 8th, announces the capture, in Hardy
County, Virginia, of 300 Federals, 125 mules, and 123 cattle.</p>
<p>Telegrams from Fortress Monroe of the 13th reported the Federal
gun-boat Iron Age aground, and under the fire of Confederate
batteries, at the entrance of Wilmington Harbour, on the 11th. Her
destruction on that day, by being blown up, is subsequently announced
by Confederate despatches to General Cooper. Twenty-four of her crew
were captured.</p>
<p>Two blocks of buildings and several large warehouses are reported
to have been destroyed in Charleston on the 20th by Gillmore's
shells. The city was almost deserted by the military. The
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> states
that three new Confederate iron-clad vessels are visible in Charleston
Harbour in a forward state of construction. It is expected that these
and other Confederate ironclads will shortly make a sortie against the
Federal squadron.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Magruder was reported to be concentrating a
corps of 20,000 men in Central Texas, with the purpose of attacking
and overwhelming the Federal troops lately landed on the bank of the
Rio Grande and the neighbouring coast.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> has come out for the
re-nomination of Mr. Lincoln to the presidency.</p>
<p>A memorandum on the plan and conduct of the war, dated Aug. 4,
1861, prepared, at the request of Mr. Lincoln, by General M'Clellan,
has just been published. The predictions of the General in that
document, which is evidently published at this time for electioneering
purposes by the General's friends, seem to have been verified by
subsequent events.</p>
<p>Smallpox is becoming so prevalent in Washington that the House of
Representatives have adopted a resolution recommending the municipal
authorities of that city and Georgetown to take measures to ensure the
vaccination of the citizens, to prevent the further spread of the
disease.</p>
<p>Governor Parker, in his message to the New Jersey Legislature,
delivered on the 12th inst., advocates the adoption of a conciliatory
policy towards the South and the reconstruction of the Union upon its
original basis. He asserts that the emancipation proclamation is the
chief obstacle to the termination of the war and the return of the
seceded States to the Union, and condemns the amnesty manifesto; but
believes that these, together with many other of Mr. Lincoln's
unconstitutional acts, will be annulled upon the change of
Administration.</p>
<p>The Democratic members of Congress, in a meeting held at
Washington, had resolved that President Lincoln's amnesty proclamation
was unconstitutional, and that the army and navy ought to be paid in
specie or its equivalent.</p>
<p>Extensive frauds in the Custom House of New York, the Treasury
Department of Washington, the Navy Yard, Brooklyn, and the public
offices continue to be discovered. Mr. Fernando Wood proposed to
appoint a Congressional Committee to investigate the administration of
affairs in all the departments, as well as the charges against General
Butler at New Orleans. The proposition was rejected by a vote of 76 to
63. A resolution to inquire into the frauds in the Custom House was,
however, adopted.</p><pb n="95"/>
<p>The New York Legislature has passed a bill to enable soldiers in
the field to vote.</p>
<p>A municipal report on the condition of the barracks on Broadway,
near Astor House, has created much indignation. Sixty men, arrested
for various military offences, were found confined in a room fifteen
by twenty feet square. Many had been there for months, with no
accommodation for sitting or lying down. The report states that they
were covered with filth and treated worse than wild beasts, and that
the existence of such a place was an outrage on humanity, bringing
disgrace to a nation.</p>
<p>The Maryland Legislature have voted in favour of calling a
convention to carry out emancipation.</p>
<p>The Judge of the Admiralty Court at Halifax had expressed an
opinion that the capture of the Chesapeake was a piratical seizure,
but had not delivered any judgment, nor ordered the restoration of the
vessel to her owners.</p>
<p>The pirate passengers who lately captured the schooner Gerety, from
Matamoras, for Havannah, took her into Honduras, and, after selling a
portion of her cargo, escaped.</p>

<p>According to the last advices from New York, the report of the
Commission appointed by the Nary Department, consisting of three
chief engineers, who have made careful experiments for five months,
showing the practicability of using petroleum or hydro-carbon oils for
the purpose of generating steam, has been issued, and proves
satisfactory. It is alleged that its use will produce a great saving,
not only for merchant steamers, but that a naval steamer can keep the
sea under steam three times as long with less labour and greater
economy as compared with an equal weight of coal.</p></div2>

<p>There is not any intelligence of military interest from
America. The main bodies of the respective armies were motionless, and
the only activity displayed was by the raids of light cavalry. The
weather was so severe that no important movement was likely for the
present, but both sides were making the most extensive preparations
for operations in the spring. It is said that the Federals intend to
make a double movement on Richmond. The Federals bombarded Charleston
for four days, from the 10th to the 14th ult., and the firing was
going on when the last reports left. Much mischief to property had
resulted, but no injury to life or person. The Federals were preparing
to meet the anticipated attack by the Confederate ironclads. On the
coast of Texas there has been a little fighting, to the advantage of
the Confederates, who are believed to be well fortified and in strong
force there. The Federals are reported to have landed at Morehead
city, North Carolina. The journals of that State continue to urge
peace with the North, and there is, beyond doubt, a strong Union
feeling existing.</p>
<p>A volume of diplomatic correspondence has been laid before
Congress, containing 700 pages of communications between the British
and the Federal Governments. In one letter Secretary Seward declared
that the Federal Cabinet must persist in maintaining that England is
responsible for the losses sustained by American citizens from the
Alabama's depredations and in urging consequent claims for
compensation. In complaining of the outfit of iron-clad rams in
British harbours, he said that those rams must be expected to assail
some of the great American ports, and that the Navy Department had not
a sufficient number of disposable vessels to protect all. In the event
of such an attack a retaliatory war would be inevitable. After Earl
Russell's intimation that orders had been given for the seizure of the
rams at Liverpool, Secretary Seward directed Mr. Adams to inform the
English Cabinet that the Federal Government would, hereafter hold
itself obliged, with even more cause than heretofore, to endeaour to
conduct its intercourse with England so that the civil war, when
terminated, will leave to neither nation any permanent cause for
discontent.</p>
<p>Further correspondence between the British and the American
Governments the main subject of which is the Alexandra and her sister
ships, has been published. Mr. Seward complains of Chief Baron
Pollock's decision in the Alexandra case, and intimates that if that
be English Law, not only does it require amendment, but America will
have to take unusual steps to protect herself against it. The American
Secretary continues, that America is sufficiently chastened by the
civil war to make any concession compatible with the interests of the
national life and honour, but she cannot stand the fitting-out of
Alabamas and Alexandras, and the responsibility for the consequences
will not be left with President Lincoln. The negotiation of a
Confederate loan in this country, Mr. Seward says, puts an end to all
concessions for mitigating the rigour of the<pb n="119"/> blockade in
regard to the shipment of tobacco and cotton. To a complaint of the
enlistment of British subjects in the Confederate service, Earl
Russell requests that it should not be repeated unless all British
subjects are discharged from the Federal service, and orders given not
to enlist any more. In respect to compensation for the depredations of
the Alabama, the noble Earl says they cannot be recognised by the
British Government, as they are not founded on grounds of law and
justice.</p>
<p>With regard to France, M. Drouyn de Lhuys had urged the recognition
of Mexico as a monarchy by the Washington Government. Mr. Seward had
firmly declined; and, while avowing that the United States would
adhere to a policy of non-intervention, he expresses a belief that the
establishment of a monarchical Government will be found neither
desirable nor easy.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed a bill imposing a duty of
two cents on cotton and an additional duty of 40 cents per gallon on
imported spirits.</p>
<p>General Rosecranz has been appointed to command the district of
Missouri.</p>
<p>General Banks had issued a proclamation declaring that more than
one tenth of the population of Louisiana desired to return to the
Union, abrogating the State laws concerning slavery, and ordering that
a convention shall revise the State Constitution, and that members of
Congress shall be elected.</p>
<p>Thomas Francis Meagher has delivered a panegyric on General
Corcoran before a large Irish audience at the Cooper Institute, New
York. His numerous references to the Fenian Brotherhood were loudly
cheered.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress have resolved that persons who furnished
substitutes will not be exempt from military service. It also passed a
resolution pledging the Confederates to perpetual resistance.</p>
<p>It was asserted that some Confederates had assembled at Point
Pel&#x00E9;e, in Canada, for the purpose of rescuing the Confederate
prisoners confined on Johnson's Island, in Lake Erie, and that a
detachment of British troops had been sent to watch their
movements.</p></div2>

<p>The Columbia brings news from New York to the evening of
Jan. 29.</p>
<p>The most important fact mentioned is the near approach of General
Longetreet, reinforced by 20,000 men, to Knoxville. Skirmishing
between his cavalry and the Federal outposts had commenced, and the
latest accounts state that great anxiety, amounting to a panic,
prevailed in the city.</p>
<p>The Confederates had made two separate attacks on Athens and
Florence, in Alabama, in both of which they are said to have
failed.</p>
<p>Despatches from Chattanooga report that the Confederate General
Johnston had fallen back forty miles south of Dalton.</p>
<p>The Federal batteries continued to throw shells into Charleston;
and it was reported that half the city had been abandoned by the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>General Butler reports that he had sent three transports and a
competent force up the James River, which landed seven miles below
Fort Powhattan and captured twenty Confederates, seven of whom
belonged to the signal corps, and brought away ninety negroes, besides
destroying large stores.</p>
<p>Re-enlistments in the Federal army are very numerous. Throughout
the West several entire corps have re-enlisted.</p>
<p>The trade of the Mississippi is still interrupted--indeed, almost
suspended--by the Confederate batteries.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has been nominated by the Republican members of the New
Jersey Legislature for the presidency.</p>
<p>The delegates to the State Convention held at Little Rock,
Arkansas, have adopted a resolution prohibiting slavery.</p>
<p>In Congress the Senate has passed a resolution requiring members to
take the oath. Senator Bayard took the oath, and announced his
intention of retiring into private life. The Judiciary Committee of
the Senate has discharged from consideration the resolution to expel
Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, from the Senate. Senator Hale urges the
appointment of a committee to investigate the affairs of the Navy
Department, and proved statistically that the United States were
called upon to spend this year for the navy more than the combined
annual naval expenses of all the European Powers, excluding Denmark
and Italy, and forty millions more than the naval expenses of France
and England during the three years and five months of the Crimean
War.</p>
<p>Mr. Fernando Wood has spoken strongly in the House of
Representatives in favour of peace, declaring that the Administration
opposed the restoration of the Union and favoured the continuance of
the war for partisan advantage. He said that the most damnable deeds
were perpetrated under the plea of patriotism.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT AND CONFEDERATE<lb/>
CRUISERS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> Tuesday was issued a batch of
correspondence with the United States' Government in continuation of
the despatches presented to Parliament last March. The new documents
consist of affidavits and memorials relating to the depredations of
the Alabama and the Florida; despatches from Mr. Adams to Earl
Russell, quoting each of these as claims for indemnity and adding them
"to others of the same kind which it has been my painful duty to
present to your Lordship heretofore;" and of replies from Earl Russell
disclaiming all responsibility in regard to the proceedings of the
Alabama or of any other Confederate cruiser.</p>
<p>In the course of a despatch dated March 27 last year Earl Russell,
describing to Lord Lyons an interview with Mr. Adams, after stating
that the American Ambassador had observed that the President might
probably find no better resource than the issue of letters of marque,
proceeds:--</p>
<p>"I said I would at once suggest a better measure. Mr. Seward had
said to Lord Lyons that the crews of privateers had this
advantage--that they reaped the whole benefit of the prizes they took,
whereas the crews of men-of-war were entitled to only half the value
of the prizes they took. Let the President, I said, offer a higher
reward for the capture of the Alabama and Oreto to the crews of
men-of-war than even the entire value of those vessels. Let him offer
double their value as a gratuity, and thus confine his action to
officers and men of the United States navy over whom he could keep a
control and who were amenable to the laws which govern an honourable
profession. But what could Mr. Adams ask of the British Government?
What was his proposal? Mr. Adams said there was one thing which might
be easily done. It was supposed the British Government were
indifferent to these notorious violations of their own laws. Let them
declare their condemnation of all such infractions of law. With
respect to the law itself, Mr. Adams said either it was sufficient for
the purposes of neutrality, and then, let the British Government
enforce it; or it was insufficient, and then let the British
Government apply to Parliament to amend it. I said that the Cabinet
were of opinion that the law was sufficient, but that legal evidence
could not always be procured. That the British Government had done
everything in its power to execute the law; but I admitted that the
cases of the Alabama and Oreto were a scandal, and, in some degree, a
reproach, to our laws. Still, I said, it was my belief that if all the
assistance given to the Federals by British subjects and British
munitions of war were weighed against similar aid given to the
Confederates, the balance would be greatly in favour of the
Federals. Mr. Adams totally denied this proposition. But, above all,
he said, there is a manifest conspiracy in this country--of which the
Confederate loan is an additional proof--to produce a state of
exasperation in America, and thus bring on a war with Great Britain
with a view to aid the Confederate cause and secure a monopoly of the
trade of the Southern States, whose independence these conspirators
hope to establish by those illegal and unjust measures. He had worked
to the best of his power for peace, but it had become a most difficult
task. Mr. Adams fully deserves the character of having always laboured
for peace between our two nations nor, I trust, will his efforts and
those of the two Governments fail of success."</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. Adams, dated the 28th of October last, Earl
Russell says:--</p>
<p>"I have had the honour to receive your letter of the 28th inst. In
that letter you inform me that you are instructed to say that the
Government of the United States must continue to insist that Great
Britain has made itself responsible for the damages which the citizens
of the United States sustain by the depredations of the vessel called
the Alabama. But towards the conclusion of your letter you state that
the Government of the United States are not disposed to act
dogmatically or in a spirit of litigation; that they desire to
maintain amity as well as peace; that they fully comprehend how
unavoidably reciprocal grievances must spring up from the divergence
of the policy of the two countries in regard to the present
insurrection. You add further on, that the United States frankly
confess themselves unwilling to regard the present hour as the most
favourable to a calm and candid examination by either party of the
facts or the principles involved in cases like the one now in
question. With this declaration her Majesty's Government may well be
content to wait the time when a calm and candid examination of the
facts and principles involved in the case of the Alabama may, in the
opinion of the Government of the United States, usefully be
undertaken. In the mean time, I must request you to believe that the
principle contended for by Her Majesty's Government is not that of
commissioning, equipping, and manning vessels in our ports to cruise
against either of the belligerent parties, a principle which was so
justly and unequivocally condemned by the President of the United
States in 1793, as recorded by Mr. Jefferson in his letter to
Mr. Hammond on the 18th of May of that year. But the British
Government must decline to be responsible for the acts of parties who
fit out a seeming merchant-ship, send her to a port or to waters far
from the jurisdiction of British Courts, and there commission, equip,
and man her as a vessel of war. Her Majesty's Government fear that if
an admitted principle were thus made elastic to suit a particular
case, the trade of shipbuilding, in which our people excel, and which
is to great numbers of them a source of honest livelihood, would be
seriously embarassed and impeded. I may add that it appears strange
that, notwithstanding the large and powerful naval force possessed by
the Government of the United States, no efficient measures have been
taken by that Government to capture the Alabama. On our part, I must
declare that to perform the duties of neutrality fairly and
impartially, and at the same time to maintain the spirit of British
law and protect the lawful industry of the Queen's subjects, is the
object of her Majesty's Government; and they trust that the Government
of the United States will recognise their earnest desire to preserve,
in the difficult circumstances of the present time, the relations of
amity between the two nations."</p>
<p>On the 29th of the same month Lord Russell informed Mr. Adams that
the proceedings of the Alabama at the Cape had been under the
consideration of the Government, and the following conclusions had
been adopted by them:--</p>
<p>"1. That her Majesty's Government are satisfied by the concurrent
testimony of the colonial and naval authorities at the Cape that at
the time of capture the Sea Bride was considerably more than three
miles distant from the nearest land. 2. That as regards the character
of the Alabama, that vessel is entitled to be treated as a ship of war
belonging to a belligerent Power, and that neither the Governor nor
any other British authority at the Cape was entitled to exercise any
jurisdiction over her. 3. That as regards the Tuscaloosa, although her
Majesty's Government would have approved the British authorities at
the Cape if they had adopted towards that vessel a course different
from that which was adopted, yet the question as to the manner in
which a vessal under such circumstances should, according to the
tenour of her Majesty's orders, be dealt with, was one not altogether
free from uncertainty. Nevertheless, instructions will be sent to the
British authorities at the Cape for their guidance in the event of a
similar case occurring hereafter, and her Majesty's Government hope
that under those instructions nothing will for the future happen to
admit of a question being raised as to her Majesty's orders having
been strictly carried out."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> consider ourselves fortunate in being
but rarely compelled to address the public upon matters affecting the
interests of this Journal, or in defence of any portion of its
conduct; but some expressions which were used by Mr. Layard in the
debate on Tuesday night, upon the subject of the burning of Kagosima,
demand a few words from the conductors of the <hi
rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London News</hi>. In Mr. Buxton's speech
in support of his resolution condemnatory of the destruction of
Kagosima, the honourable member for Maidstone read an extract from an
article accompanying a Sketch of the bombardment of that city
transmitted to us by our Special Artist in Japan. The object of the
reference and of the quotation was to show the great amount of ruin
that had been effected by the British squadron. In his reply, on
behalf of the Government, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs "did not wish to say anything against that admirable and
useful publication the <hi rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London
News</hi>; but those who were in the secret knew how drawings were
made of places at the other end of the world, and he doubted whether
any person connected with the News was at Kagosima when the engagement
took place. It was not impossible, indeed, that a picture of a town in
South America had been furbished up to represent a town in Japan."</p>
<p>Whatever pictorial value may attach to the Engravings of distant
scenery and events which appear in this Journal, their greatest value
is, undoubtedly, in their genuineness and authenticity. To secure
these qualities, the Conductors spare no cost or exertion; and
incessant tributes from all parts of the world to the fidelity of the
representations which we offer give us the amplest assurance that we
are well served by the gentlemen who undertake the troublesome, and
often dangerous, mission of sketching for us. Remarks, therefore, like
those which escaped Mr. Layard in the heat of a debate, would scarcely
have required notice from us had they proceeded from a less
distinguished man than the accomplished Under-Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs. We felt it due to him, no less than to ourselves, to
convince him that the evidence brought forward by Mr. Buxton from our
pages was of the highest order, and we had the satisfaction of showing
Mr. Layard, not only the original sketch, transmitted by Mr. Charles
Wirgman, our Artist in Japan, but some evidence in unintended but
complete corroboration of the accuracy of Mr. Wirgman's
drawing. Mr. Layard's frankness and courtesy are proverbial, and we
have no reason to doubt that he will be glad, upon fitting occasion,
to do us the justice which we were denied amid the excitement of an
energetic debate. We also thought it our duty to place the sketches
and papers in the hands of the honourable member for Maidstone, that
he might be satisfied of the truthfulness of the extract he had quoted
from this journal.</p>
<p>Whilst adverting to the subject, it seems scarcely out of place to
mention, lest any similar misconception should arise in regard to
other Engravings which are just now sought after with the utmost
interest, that in Schleswig-Holstein Mr. Landells is present on the
scene of the strife there raging, entirely engaged with his pencil and
pen in our service; and that Mr. F. Vizetelly is in Richmond, as we
learned not an hour ago from one of high authority just returned to
England from the Southern States vi&#x00E2; the "underground."
Sketches from the latter gentleman have to make their way through the
blockade, and such as escape the hands of the Federals appear at once
in this Paper. To this system of procuring, under great risks and at
almost any cost, faithful representations of the scenes we propose to
depict, is due the greater part of the favour by which the <hi

public.</p></div2>

and that from that time until this no step has been taken to bring the
cause to an issue, except that on Saturday last the information was
filed. This the noble Earl humbly conceived might have been done in
the month of October or November. The question was whether the
Government were prepared to lay upon the table the correspondence
which had taken place upon the remonstrance made with respect to
injuries sustained by American commerce in consequence of certain
vessels having sailed from British ports. He wished for this
correspondence as well as that relating to the Alabama, and any
correspondence containing representations on the part of her Majesty's
Government against the apparent violation of the law by American
cruisers in enforcing their rights. He also asked whether the noble
Earl would lay before the House any correspondence that might have
taken place on the report of some very curious decisions which had
been come to in the prize courts of the United States. Under the
circumstances the noble Earl could not see that the publication of
these despatches would in any way clash with the cases now before the
courts of law. The correspondence had been published in America; the
noble Earl wished to have the English version of that
correspondence. What course the Government had taken in vindication of
international law in respect to the differences that had arisen
between this country and America was a question that Parliament was
bound to consider. He urged the noble Earl (Earl Russell) to
reconsider his reply of Tuesday, and lay this correspondence before
their Lordships.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said that
when the attention of her Majesty's Government was first brought to
these vessels the answer they received to inquiries that they made was
that they were intended for the French; but the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs denied this. The ships were evidently intended for
warlike purposes, and Mr. Adams was told that her Majesty's Government
was looking out for evidence as to the persons for whom the vessels
were really destined. Another story afterwards became current that the
vessels were intended for the Viceroy of Egypt. This was also found to
be without foundation. With regard to the general question, the noble
Earl thought that Mr. Adams was not far wrong in saying that vessels
were fitted out here to be used for warlike purposes against a State
that was at peace with her Majesty. This was undoubtedly a gross
insult to her Majesty. But the law officers of the Crown, who have
been consulted on the question, consider that her Majesty's Government
must suffer from having their case only partially stated, so they
would suffer, from having the case in the courts of law forestalled;
therefore their request was that the Government should not produce
those papers. The noble Earl felt he should be doing an injustice to
the law officers of the Crown and thwarting the fair hearing of the
case if he produced the correspondence. With respect to the question
of the conduct of the prize courts of America, the noble Earl was far
from thinking that they had in every case done England justice. The
noble Earl concluded by saying that he would look over the papers and
see what he could produce without detriment to the public service, and
should the noble Earl require any particular document, he would either
produce it or give valid reasons for withholding it.</p></div2>

<p>The Confederates appear to have made a general aggressive
movement.  General Longstreet has, it is stated, driven the Federals
into Knoxville and got possession of the French Bread River, whence
large supplies of forage can be drawn. In North Carolina they had
driven in the Federal outposts, and in Western Virginia had captured
some Federal detachments and stores; but, on pressing their
advantages, they were repulsed in both instances.</p>
<p>The Federals have recommenced shelling Fort Sumter, having
discovered that the Confederates had remounted five guns on the
fort.</p>
<p>There was a renewed report of General Meade being superseded by
General Thomas.</p>
<p>Another land and naval expedition was being fitted out at New
Orleans; its destination was not known, but was supposed to be
Mobile.</p>
<p>The Southern army is said to be in the best spirits, and the
soldiers were re-enlisting by brigades and regiments. General Lee
issued an order on the 22nd ult. stating that the temporary reduction
of rations was caused by circumstances beyond the control of those
charged with the support of the army; but it was hoped this would be
of short duration. The army has proved that the country could require
no sacrifice too great for its patriotism.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has ordered a forced levy of 500,000 men. The
levy is to be made on the 10th of March next, and all volunteers who
may be raised before that date will be deducted from it. The 300,000
men summoned in October last are to be included in the 500,000
required by the present call, which is therefore an order for an
additional levy of 200,000 men.</p>
<p>A bill has been reported in the House of Representatives
appropriating 529,000,000 dols. for the army expenses in the year
ending June, 1865.</p>
<p>The New York Legislature has resolved to add 2,000 000 dols. to
the recruiting fund, and to increase the State bounty to 300 dols.</p>
<p>A New York letter states that since the outbreak of the civil war
President Lincoln has called out about 2,000,000 men for service in
the Federal army, and 500,000 for service in the Federal navy.</p>
<p>Quite an excitement exists in relation to the next
presidency. Mr. Lincoln has been nominated by the several State
Legislatures and conventions, and it is believed that he will get the
regular Republican nomination, although Mr. Chase's friends are
advancing his claims with great energy. It is also said that Fremont
will be a candidate. The nomination of General Grant has been strongly
advocated by the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> and several
other papers; but M'Clellan, thus far, seems to be the probable
candidate of the Democratic party.</p>
<p>Colonel Colt's pistol factory at Hartford, Connecticut, has been
destroyed by fire: 1700 workmen were thrown out of employment, and the
loss was computed at over 2,000,000 dollars. The new buildings in
which mini&#x00E9; rifles are made were saved.</p>
<p>The Cabinet of Washington has ordered a Court of Inquiry to
investigate the circumstances under which an officer of the Federal
steamer Vanderbilt shot Mr. Gray, the mate of the British barque
Saxon, which was captured by the Vanderbilt at Angra Pequena, and
which is alleged to have been taken in British waters. According to
the published accounts of the occurrence and the statements of the
English crew, an unprovoked murder was committed by Doniphan, the
Federal officer; but the <hi rend="italic">Boston Advertiser</hi>
states that Doniphan declares the fatal shot was fired accidentally by
him.</p>
<p>The Judge of the Admiralty Court at Halifax has decided to restore
the Chesapeake and cargo to the owners, subject to conditions
respecting the payment of such expenses as the Attorney-General may
exact. The Attorney-General demands a surety against latent claims,
but the owners of the Chesapeake demur to this.</p>
<p>The hearing of the case of the men implicated in the seizure of
the Chesapeake was still going on at St. John, New
Brunswick. Testimony was given to the effect that ten of the men who
seized the ship were commissioned Confederate officers.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The British and United States
Governments.</hi>--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi>, adverting
to some observations made by the Earl of Derby in a former
discussion, read extracts from the correspondence with Mr. Adams;
and, by a comparison of dates, proved that the decision of the
Government as to detaining the iron-clad rams could not have been
influenced by any representations of Mr. Adams. He thought that the
Earl of Derby ought to have quoted the correspondence more
completely.--The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> denied that
he had suppressed anything. He had seen the volume of correspondence
laid before Congress, and therefore knew it was in this country, but
he had not read it. The passages he quoted were taken from a
newspaper.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi>, having heard the
noble Lord refer to the official publication laid before Congress,
had concluded too hastily he had read the volume.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor laid on the table a return showing the working
of the Augmentation of Benefices Act, under which it appeared that
sixty-seven livings had been sold, thirty-seven of which fetched
&#x00A3;65,300, and negotiations were in progress for the sale of
fifty-three more.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">British And American Claims.</hi>--The Earl of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Carnarvon</hi> moved for a return of claims made
by British subjects upon the United States' Government, sustained
either in person or property since the secession of the Southern
States, specifying how and the grounds on which such claims have been
disposed of; and to ask for any further information as to claims made
by the United States' Government upon her Majesty's Government for
damages alleged to be done to American ships by the Alabama and other
Confederate cruisers. He pointed out that many vessels engaged in
legitimate trade had unwarrantably been seized, and he alluded to the
case of the Saxon, and that of the Tuscaloosa, which had been seized
at the Cape, a matter which required explanation. He stated that the
claims of British subjects for compensation for illegal seizure of
vessels amounted to no less than two millions.--Earl <hi
rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said that personally, he had no
objection to the granting of the return; but it would be<pb n="183"/>
very voluminous, and its publication would tend to prejudice the
claims to which it would refer. He justified the proceedings of the
American prize courts, while as regarded the Saxon ample apology had
been made by the Captain of the American cruiser for what had
occurred; and as to the murder of the mate, all that could be asked
was that the offender be put on his trial. The Tuscaloosa was seized
under the advice of the law of officers of the Crown. He repudiated
now, as he had always done, any claims arising out of the depredations
of the Alabama.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 13th ult. Of war movements we
learn, among other matters, that General Meade made a reconnaisance on
the 5th, on the south side of the Rapidan, where he found Lee in
force, and, after a brief engagement, retired; that 4000 Confederates
made a demonstration against Cumberland Gap on the 29th ult., but,
after heavy skirmishing, were driven back; that General Sherman's
whole force has crossed the Black River, with a view to a junction
with a cavalry and infantry force--it is supposed to flank Johnston
and Hardee in Alabama and Georgia; that Admiral Porter is fitting out
a formidable fleet on the Mississippi; and that, the siege of
Chmieston having proved a failure, General Gilmore and Admiral
Dahlgren had dispatched a land and naval expedition to Florida, and,
having made a landing at Jacksonville, the expedition was supposed to
be advancing on Tallahassee.</p>
<p>On the night of the 2nd a large steamer entered Charleston Harbour,
unobserved by the Federal fleet, and was not discovered until the
morning of the 3rd, when she had run aground and was landing her cargo
under the guns of Fort Moultrie. The Federal batteries opened on her,
and shortly afterwards she sank.</p>
<p>The British gun-boat Petrel arrived at Charleston on the 5th,
wishing to caniniunicate with the British Consul at Savannah. Admiral
Dahlgren refused permission, and the Petrel put to sea.</p>
<p>A considerable force, sent by General Butler towards Richmond for
the purpose of surprising the Confederates and releasing the Federal
prisoners, was discovered when within twelve miles of the city, and
obliged to return. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi>

<p>Mr. Haliburton asked whether the Government had heard of the
capture of a veecel bearing the Confederate flag by a Federal cruiser
in the harbour of Pankbar, Nova Scotia, and under the guns of the
fort; and whether her Majesty's Government had entered into a
correspondence with the United States on the subject of this
outrage.--Mr. Layard said the subject was still under inquiry, and
therefore he could not give any definite reply to the question. He
might say, however, that the facts had been brought under the notice
of the American Government, and Mr. Seward had made an ample
apology.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Monday.</hi></p>
<p>Earl De Grey and Ripon, in answer to Lord Stratheden, stated that
it was not intended to send military commissioners to report on the
operations of the Federal or Confederate armies; but an engineer, an
artillery and a naval officer, had been sent to report on improvements
in artillery and iron-clad ships in the Federal States, but not to the
Confederate States.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. Layard, in reply to Sir R. Clifton, said the Government had
given its consent to the removal from Richmond of tobacco purchased by
France and Austria, provided such a course was not taken as a
precedent. Cotton was in another category. It belonged to private
individuals, while the tobacco was the property of the two Governments
he had named.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Steam-Rams In The
Mersey.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. S. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzgerald</hi> moved for papers
relating to the seizure of the steam rams at Liverpool. He did not
want those relating to the judicial proceedings as to the rams, but
only those before the seizure. Reviewing the documents which had been
laid before Congress on the subject, he said it seemed to him that the
Government had no good grounds for the seizure; and he asked for the
papers in order that the House might see whether the law had or had
not been overstepped by the Executive.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Attorney-General</hi> said the papers
asked for were only a fragmentary part of the case, and would not give
to the House the means of forming a correct opinion on the subject. He
vindicated the conduct of the Government, and said they had made
inquiries which proved that the vessels were not, as had been
represented, for Egypt or France. That they were intended for the
Confederates was shown by a paragraph which he quoted from the report
of the Secretary of the Confederate Navy. The trial as to the vessels
would take place in May next. The Government had only vindicated the
law, and done what they would expect other countries under similar
circumstances to do.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Horsfall</hi> declared the proceedings of
the Government in the case of the Alexandra, and against
Messrs. Laird, to be cruelly unjust, and a profligate expenditure of
public money.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Cecil</hi> also attacked the
Government for its conduct in the matter.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">W. E. Forster</hi> supported them, and
argued that English interests were sustained by the course which had
been pursued in the seizure of the vessels.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">H. Cairns</hi> at great length criticised
the proceedings in respect to the steam-rams, and strongly condemned
them.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Solicitor-General</hi> replied to him;
and, after some observations from Mr. Walpole and Mr. T. Baring, the
House divided, and rejected Mr. Fitzgerald's motion by 178 votes to
153.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Steam-Rams In The Mersey.</hi>--The Earl

had asked Earl Russell on two occasions before--whether her Majesty's
Government would give to Parliament copies of the correspondence that
had taken place with reference to the detention of the rams in the
Mersey? In doing so the noble Earl referred to the reply he last
received and to the discussion that had taken place upon the question
in the House of Commons.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said
the noble Earl had somewhat misrepresented his reply. The answer he
had given was, that the law officers of the Crown considered the
production of these papers would result in an incomplete discussion of
the legal point at issue in the Houses of Parliament, and so prejudice
the result of the cause now being discussed in the courts of law. With
regard to the other papers for which the noble Earl asked, he had
replied that he would look over the correspondence that had taken
place, and produce any further papers to the production of which there
could be no objection. The noble Earl then laid such papers upon the
table.--After some further discussion, which was joined in by Earl
Russell, the Earl of Derby, Lord Granvllle, Lord Chelmsford, and the
Earl of Carnarvon, the subject dropped.</p><pb n="207"/>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>News from New York extends to the 19th ult. General Meade left
Washington on the 15th to resume the permanent command of the army of
the Potomac. The Federal General Sherman occupied Jackson,
Mississippi, on the 5th ult., and had advanced to Brandon. A portion
of his troops occupied Yazoo city on the same day. General Thomas is
reported to have moved towards Dalton. These advances are considered
to be the opening of the spring campaign in the southwest, which
appears likely to comprehend a combined movement against Mobile,
Savannah, and the Confederate armies and strongholds in Georgia. Naval
and military expeditions now preparing at New Orleans are to
co-operate. It is anticipated that the Confederates willopen the
spring campaign by a formidable raid into Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>President Davis has issued an address to the army thanking the
troops for their alacrity. He says that "the spring campaign opens
under auspices well calculated to sustain their hopes. Assured success
awaits their struggle for liberty and independence."</p>
<p>President Davis has signed a bill prohibiting the exportation of
tobacco, rice, sugar, and molasses, except by special permit; also a
bill prohibiting the importation of luxuries after March next, and
fixing the maximum price at which articles of silk, wool, flax, and
cotton may be imported.</p>
<p>A despatch received at Washington from General Butler announces
that Colonel Straight and about 100 Federal prisoners escaped from
Richmond by tunnelling under the walls of the gaol. The Colonel and
twenty other officers had arrived at Williamsburg. Butler had sent out
cavalry as far as the Chickahominy to assist the flight of the escaped
prisoners. Twenty-two officers had been recaptured by the Confederates
and more were expected to be brought in. The guards of the prisoners
were placed under arrest, charged with aiding the prisoners to
escape.</p>
<p>General Banks had issued orders restoring compulsory labour in
Louisiana under certain conditions, and declaring that it was the duty
of the people to re-establish the civil Government, and that
"indifference would be treated as a crime."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has decided against Mr. Vallandigham's
application to annul the sentence passed upon him by the military
court.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives, by a majority of twenty-one, have
passed a resolution in favour of an amendment to the Constitution
abolishing slavery.</p>
<p>Details are given of a wholesale destruction of
blockade-runners. The Wild Dayrell was run ashore near Stump Inlet,
and was completely destroyed by her captors. The estimated value of
ship and cargo was 200,000 dols. The steamer Nutfield, an iron
paddle-steamer, whioh sailed from London in December last, and was
bound from Bermuda to Wilmington, was run ashore to escape pursuit
near New River Inlet. She also was fired and destroyed. Her cargo
consisted of arms and ammunition, including a battery of eight
Whitworth guns. Some of her crew were drowned in endeavouring to reach
the shore in a boat. The steamer Dee, a new double-screw iron steamer,
recently from London, was run ashore and burnt off Masonboro'. She was
loaded with lead, coffee, and bacon. Seven of her crew were taken
prisoners. The side-wheel steamer Fanny and Jennie was run ashore and
destroyed in close proximity to the Dee. Twenty-five of her crew were
taken prisoners. The capture of the Emily, a new steamer, from
London, and of the steamer Cumberland are also reported. The latter
was taken while on the passage from Havannah to Mobile, and was laden
with arms and ammunition.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Slave Trade.</hi>--Mr. <hi
rend="smallcaps">Cave</hi> asked the First Lord of the Treasury
whether her Majesty's Government intended to carry into execution the
provisions of the treaty with the United States for the suppression of
the slave trede by stationing cruisers off the coast of Cuba.--Lord
<hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> said that no doubt the provisions
of the document alluded to had been colourably evaded so far as
related to the French interest in the matter, but really he thought it
was without design in that quarter. Great progress had been made in
the suppression of the traffic, and it might be depended upon that no
inactivity would be exhibited therein.</p>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi rend="smallcaps">Tuesday.</hi></p>/
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Alleged Federal Recruiting In
Ireland.</hi></p>
<p>The Marquis of <hi rend="smallcaps">Clanricarde</hi>, in moving for
copies of any papers that might have been received by the Government
relative to recruiting in Ireland for the army of the Federal States,
inquired whether any remonstrance against such a proceeding had been
addressed to the authorities at Washington. It was, he said, notorious
that American agents had been enlisting recruits in the sister island,
and, as it was in violation of the principle of neutrality and a
breach of international law, he urged that it was the duty of the
Government to put a stop to it.</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said he had no doubt that
any attempt on the part of the Federals to enlist recruits for their
army in Ireland would be a breach of the principle of neutrality, and
that it was an offence against our own municipal laws, which, if
detected, would subject the offender to punishment, and justify strong
complaints to the Government of the United States. On more than one
occasion he had already complained that such practices as the noble
Marqusi had adverted to were going on on behalf of the Federal
Government in Ireland, and he had opened a correspondence with
Mr. Adams on the subject. That gentleman had, however, indignantly
denied the truth of such allegations; and, having received that
denial, he (Earl Russell) felt obliged to wait until some case had
occurred in which proof was forthcoming.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Donoughmore</hi> observed that the
conduct of the Foreign Office in the particular case which had been
made the subject of inquiry contrasted most unfavourably with the
course they had adopted in reference to the steam rams.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> inquired whether the
Government had received any information from the authorities at Cork
and Dublin to the effect that persons were in the habit of assembling
in these places for the purpose of going through military drill and
exercise, and, if so, whether they had taken any measures to put down
such illegal proceedings.</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi> replied that the Dublin
authorities had directed the attention of the police to the
proceediegs of the Fenian Brotherhood, and there was reason to believe
that it was a perfectly contemptible organisation.</p>
<p>The motion for papers was then withdrawn.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi

<p>Mr. Long gave notice that on Monday he would ask Lord Palmerston
whether the ships of war of the Confederate States were allowed the
same rights end privileges of searching and seizing contraband of war
on the high seas, &#x0026;c.; and, if not, whether he thought it was
extending to them the same principle of impartiality as was shown to
the Federal States.</p></div2>

failed to provide a steamer. The <hi rend="italic">Galway Gazette</hi>
says:--"The directors of the Atlantic Company have applied to the Post

between Galway and America until June next. They have also intimated
their intention of entering into negotiations with another company for
the use of steamers to commence the service at that time, as the ships
of the company will not be in readiness to sail even then. The
directors are reported to be of opinion that they can never carry out
the contract with the ships at present in their possession, and will,
in all probability, endeavour to effect a sale of their interest in
the project, with a transfer of the mail subsidy to some existing
company more capable of carrying out the project. Two or three
companies are said to be in negotiation with the Atlantic Company on
the subject at present."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Soundings from the Atlantic.</hi> By
O. W. Holmes. (1 vol. Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.) The "Autocrat of
the Breakfast Table" needs introduction to (we should hope) very few
English readers; and a fresh volume from his pen will, no doubt, find
a cordial welcome. The nine essays and one oration now offered in a
compact form for public perusal combine, after the author's fashion,
fun and serious reflections, and are written in a style which makes
them more than commonly readable. The awful war now raging amongst our
Transatlantic kinsmen naturally forms one of the topics which
Mr. Holmes undertakes to handle; and in the oration appended to his
other compositions, with the title of "The Inevitable Trial," he
discusses at some length the origin, the progress, and the probable
result of the great struggle. This is not the place to follow him step
by step, but it is compatible with our province to announce that he
does not despair of the Republic.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Dan to Beersheba.</hi> (1 vol. Chapman and Hall.)
A supplementary or, more correctly speaking, an explanatory title is
given to this singular book--the alias is "Northern and Southern
Friends." We began to read with an impression that the American civil
war would furnish the groundwork of the story; but it was not so. Nor
is there any satisfactory explanation given of the scriptural title;
so that, as we failed to find either Dan or Beersheba upon the only
map of America we happen to possess, we were constrained to guess from
the hints furnished by the narrative that Dan is, being interpreted,
Boston, and Beersheba, Charleston; for Northern friends from the
capital of Massachusetts go upon a visit to Southern friends in the
capital of the Palmetto State, and there are no other fixed points
which the most elastic imagination could comfortably fasten upon as
corresponding in position with Dan and Beersheba. The writer's object,
we apprehend, is to sketch the habits and manners of both Northern and
Southern Americans; and the conclusion we arrived at from the
specimens given was that both are almost equally objectionable. There
is no attempt at plot. Flirtations, and arguments, and dances, and
revels, and slave crimes, and slave-hunts and their attendant horrors
(including anti-slavery meetings and speeches, and pro-slavery
brutality) follow one another with true American independence; and the
ultimate bliss even of the hero and heroine (to strain the
time-honoured terms) is left to mere conjecture. On the whole, the
writer, though distributing ugly features with tolerable impartiality,
seems to incline just a little to the Northern side, for which the
tendency of Southern ladies (according to the author's representation)
to treat lovers slightingly and to sing improper songs, and of
Southern gentlemen to propose to ladies under extraordinary
circumstances and in Bedlamite language, is sufficient to account.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My Days and Nights on the Battle-field.</hi> By
Carleton. (1 vol. Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.) This is a little
work, intended chiefly for boys, giving some account (accompanied by
diagrams) of several of the more important engagements between
Federals and Confederates in the earlier part of the present war. A
sketch of later battles is conditionally promised. The style is
somewhat bombastic and the spirit is intensely Union.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to Feb. 24. It consists mainly of
conflicting rumours. First, we are informed that Sherman had reached
Quitman, on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, with a force estimated at
between 25,000 and 30,000 men; that he had defeated Polk, near
Brandon, and captured 12,000 prisoners; and that Admiral Farragut was
preparing to attack the Confederates at Grant's Pass. A different
statement, however, is made in the Richmond papers. Those papers
assert that the Federals have been repulsed with great loss at Grant's
Pass, and that the Federal force at Quitman consisted of about 1000
men employed in tearing up the railroad. Nothing is said, however,
about the alleged defeat of Polk. General Longstreet was rumoured to
have retired from the neighbourhood of Knoxville, and to have
retreated beyond the French Broad River. General Gilmore had returned
from Florida to Port Royal, and reported that his expedition had been
successful. The Confederates have been twice repulsed in an attack
upon the Federals opposite Natchez, Mississippi. General Meade will
retain the command of the army of the Potomac during the next
campaign.</p>
<p>The Committee of Ways and Means reported back the bill authorising
the Secretary of the Treasury to sell the surplus gold, with a
recommendation that it be not passed, and that no further action be
taken.</p>
<p>The National Executive Committee had nominated Mr. Chase for the
presidency, while the Maryland State Union Convention had named
Mr. Lincoln.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....The Fenians, who have given rise to one or two Thackerayian
imitations of Irish ballads, have called forth "Mister Smith O'Brine,
who once raged like a line (lion)" on the "Shannon shore," but who now
tends the soundest advice in the most cogent of reasoning to his
Fenian or Finian friends. "Don't," says he in effect, "don't, my
friends, enlist, for the Northern States; it is a roundabout way to
free Ireland by getting kilt in America. The Federals only use you,
and crush you, and put you to the fore to be slain." Much more to this
tune, says O'Brien the King; and he calculates that upwards of 200,000
Irish have been cruelly "used up" on American soil. That this advice
will affect Yankee recruiting, we have no doubt; that like words have
done so is apparent from the fact that the recruiting-sergeants have
been shipping loads of Germans from Liverpool to fill the jaws of the
Yankee war. Is it not a pity that the German and the Celt did not
study Emerson, who so candidly explains that the coarse bodies of the
German and Irish are made purposely to manure the soil for the sweet
efflorescence of the superior Yankee?</p>
<p>And how "do you keep your health?" as Mrs. Lincoln said to
Mr. Sala, but which question we would apply to the American Bird o'
Freedom itself. Really, Sir, not very well. The South is <hi
rend="italic">not</hi> in a state of disintegration, but adheres more
strongly than over to its purpose. Charleslon is <hi
rend="italic">not</hi> taken, and, indeed, not one firm step forward
has been made by the North. Moreover, one of the Southern
commissioners is here back in London debating, or, rather, ready to
debate, with Lord Palmerston and Louis Napoleon the expediency of
recognition. Surely the heads of the Northern people must be alive now
to the hopelessness of their dream of reunion. Surely enough blood has
been spilt, and enough groans and tears have been vented and shed. In
the mean time, too, the deterioration of American society must have
been going on--luxury on one hand, license and corruption on the
other; sudden fortunes by illicit dealings, shoddy princes, springing
up like mushrooms, and firm and stalwart merchants of the old and
honourable school falling quickly to decay; these are not sights which
exalt a nation. Will not the Yankees at this last hour let their
"wayward sisters go in peace," or will they persist to the "bitter
end," an end no less bitter assuredly to themselves than to their
opponents, who are already growing better under the "sweet uses of
adversity"? By-the-way, one ought to notice the clear photographic
minuteness and evident truth of Mr. Sala's pen-pictures of "America in
a state of war." Nothing has ever been better done in that way. Many
object that he says little about the war, and for two very good
reasons, let us add. In the first place, his letters are not about the
war, but concerning the people during its progression; and, in the
second, it is absolutely at a stand-still, as we may gather from the
letters of Dr. Mackay in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which
specifically concern it....</p></div2>

<p>As far as can be gathered from the latest accounts from New York,
the Federal movements in Virginia and the south-west have been
failures. General Sherman had been obliged to return to Vicksburg
without effecting the object of his advance into Alabama, and General
Thomas's advance upon Dalton and Atlanta had been checked by General
Joseph Johnston. General Kilpatrick, who had been engaged in a cavalry
raid in the rear of Lee's army, had found it impossible to reach
Richmond, and had returned into the Federal lines. A forward movement
had been made by General Meade, to divert attention from Kilpatrick's
movements; but, by the latest accounts, the army of the Potomac was at
its old position at Brandy Station. General Meade has again been
summoned to Washington to consult with Lincoln and the War
Department. The Federals have been seriously repulsed in Florida. In
an engagement beyond Jacksonville, on the 20th ult., they were
defeated with a loss of 1000 men and several guns. At Charleston the
Federal sloop of war Housatonic was destroyed on the 18th ult. by a
Confederate torpedo. The Northern crew, with the exception of two
officers and three men, were rescued by boats from other blockading
vessels. The Confederate guerrilla, Colonel Richardson, has been
captured by Federal cavalry.</p>
<p>President Lincoln sent to the Senate the nomination of
Major-General Grant to be Lieutenant-General, in accordance with the
provisions of the new law reviving that rank in the army; and the
appointment has been confirmed.</p>
<p>On the 1st inst. the Senate passed the House bill providing for
the issue of 200,000,000 dols. in forty-five bonds; and also a joint
resolulution of thanks to re-enlisted veterans.</p>
<p>In the House of Representatives, on the 29th ult., the bill to
authorise the transfer of 200,000,000 dols. from the 900,000,000
dols. ten-forty loan into a five-forty loan was passed. The bill also
authorises the issue of 11,000,000 dols. additional five-twenties to
supply the overplus of subscriptions on the day the loan was
exhausted.</p>
<p>The draught in New York has been postponed. Bounties will be
continued till the 1st of April.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress has adjourned, after having issued
addresses declaring that the South will make no overtures for peace
until the Federal Cabinet shall announce them to be acceptable, and
that the Southern Confederacy would submit to a European protectorate
rather than to Yankee domination.</p>
<p>A bill has passed the Confederate Senate to establish a volunteer
navy. It authorises the Secretary of the Navy to commission vessels
either in or out of the waters of the Confederate States.</p>
<p>General Bragg has been appointed General-in-Chief of the
Confederate armies.</p>
<p>Richmond papers contain the following address of General Beauregard
to his troops:--
<q><p>Soldiers!--The term of service of some of you is about to
expire. You must have seen from the newspapers that your brothers in
arms of the veteran armies of Northern Virginia and Tennessee have
re-enrolled, as was to be expected of such men, by entire companies,
battalions, regiments, and brigades, proudly retaining the
organisation intact under which they won renown. Will the men who have
defended Sumter and Moultrie fail to follow these examples of
soldierly patriotism?</p></q></p>
<p>The population of Wisconsin appears to be of a polyglot character,
as the Governor's message is to be printed, by order, in the German,
Norwegian, Irish, Welsh, Dutch, and French languages.</p>
<p>The Chicago correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi> writes, under date of the 15th ult.:--"A gentleman arrived
in this city from Idaho last week says that, when he left, it was
estimated that there was 15,000,000 dols. in gold in the hands of the
miners, awaiting the means of transportation to the
States."</p></div2>

<p>....Amongst other curions items of news only to be found in the
writings of the eccentric Manhattan we gather that Mr. George
Thompson, a foremost workman once in the corn-law agitation, but now
neglected by his party, has arrived in New York, and has been
presented to the sovereign people as "the representative of Liberal
democracy in England, and the true friend of America." Mr. Thompson
did his best to praise America at the expense of John Bull, and said
that millions of hearts in England worshipped Fremont! Surely, this is
a poor <hi rend="italic">m&#x00E9;tier</hi> for a man to take up in
his old age who has done good service in his youth. Pleasant it is
also to be told that we hear that for the sake of "making the
President popular" we are to have hostility displayed towards
England. Candidates for the presidency are cropping up like
mushrooms. There is not a negro barber in New York, we are told with
pardonable exaggeration, who is not an aspirant for the presidency,
and who does not think he has a good chance. If a railsplitter is
elected, why not a barber? "I do not believe," writes Manhattan, "In

<p>Mr. Roebuck made an angry attack on the general policy of Lord
Russell as Foreign Minister, and, adverting especially to the
intention of the Government to remonstrate with President Davis on the
employment of Confederate agents in this country, he wished to know
whether representations would be made to the Government of Washington
with reference to the enlistment of recruits in Ireland for the
Federal service.--Lord Palmerston defended the policy of the
Government with regard to the American war, and stated that there was
no evidence to show that the Federals were recruiting in
Ireland. After some discussion the subject dropped.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> are indebted to Mr. Bateman Smith, one
of the cabin passengers who escaped from the wreck of the Bohemian,
for a sketch of that vessel upon the rocks near Portland Harbour, on
the coast of Maine, U.S., where she got aground on the 22nd of last
month. The steamer, carrying nineteen cabin passengers and 199
steerage, besides the mails and cargo, with a crew of about one
hundred men, left Liverpool on the 4th of February, and had been some
days overdue at Portland when she met with this disaster. She was just
rounding Cape Elizabeth, to enter the harbour from Casco Bay, when she
struck upon a ledge called St. Alden's Rock, about three miles from
land. It was about eight o'clock in the evening; the night was foggy,
and the speed of the vessel was not more than two or two miles and a
half an hour. It appears that the master, Captain Borland, had
misjudged the distance of the lights visible on Cape Elizabeth. The
vessel, having struck and passed over<pb n="286"/> the rocks, found a
large hole in her bottom, and began to fill rapidly. She was then
turned towards the shore, with the intention of beaching her; but,
when she got very near the land, her engine fires were put out, and
she sunk in four fathoms of water, in an almost upright position, as
shown in the Engraving. This was about an hour and a quarter after she
struck. The weather was mild and calm, and there was no sea but the
usual groundswell. The deck, after the ship had settled down, was a
foot or two above water at low tide, and not more than an eighth of a
mile from the shore. Most of the passengers, however, had already left
the ship, the first boat taking eighty of them in one trip and seventy
in the next trip all safe to land. The second boat was, unfortunately,
swamped, and nineteen or twenty lives were thus lost, all Irish
steerage passengers, including five or six women and one or two
children. The other boats, with the remainder of the passengers, had
no difficulty in getting to shore. Captain Borland, with some of the
officers and crew, remained on board until next day, and managed to
save the mails. By the verdict of the Coroner's jury, at the inquest
held upon those drowned, it is declared that, "after the vessel
struck, her officers and men worked with energy and good judgment,
rarely equalled and never surpassed, to avoid the loss of life." The
citizens of Portland, and especially those dwelling near Cape
Elizabeth, are much commended for their humane efforts to relieve and
provide for the destitute passengers and to help them to their
destinations. There are still hopes of raising the vessel, which rests
with her centre upon a rock, but with her bow and stern in deep
water.</p></div2>

<p>President Lincoln has presented General Grant with the commission
of Lieutenant-General in presence of the whole Cabinet. Grant, after
visiting the army of the Potomac, returned, with Meade, to Washington,
and left immediately for the west. The <hi rend="italic">New York
World</hi> asserts that Grant has recommended the concentration of
forces for the capture of Richmond.</p>
<p>Rumours of General Meade's removal from command are current at
Washington. It appears that Generals Sickles and Doubleday assert that
Meade issued an order for a retreat after the first day's fight at
Gettysburg. This, however, Meade denies point blank in a letter to
Reverdy Johnson, admitting, however, that he had arranged before the
battle to take a safer position, and one where he could more
advantageously accept battle, and dwelling with particular tenacity
upon the point that that could not be a retreat which was to take
place without a fight.</p>
<p>There is no news of importance from the army of the Potomac. A
reconnaissance on the 5th to Ely's Ford discovered very few
Confederates to the north of the Rapidan.</p>
<p>Suffolk, in Virginia, has been occupied by Butler's forces.</p>
<p>The Confederates continue to make demonstrations against Suffolk
and Portsmouth, and have driven in the Federal cavalry and two
coloured regiments.</p>
<p>General Sherman's return to Vicksburg is confirmed. He penetrated
thirty-five miles beyond Meridian, destroying all railroads. His loss
is stated to have been only 500 men.</p>
<p>General Johnston was pressing the Federal lines in Tennessee. The
Federals have withdrawn from Tunnel Hill to Ringold. Longatreet's
cavalry hold Bull's Gap, fifty-six miles from Knoxvlle. His army is at
Greenville.</p>
<p>The Federals occupy Morristown, forty-two miles from Knoxville.</p>
<p>The failure of Kilpatrick's cavalry raid on Richmond was
complete. Upon the person of Colonel Dahlgren, who was cut off and
killed, papers were found informing the troops that their mission was
to burn Richmond and release the Federal prisoners, and not to allow
Jefferson Davis to escape. The Richmond press is strongly incensed,
and urges that the severest treatment should be exercised towards the
prisoners of Kilpatrick's command. The Northern press declares that
the orders said to have been found on Dalhgren were forgeries.</p>
<p>Admiral Farragut has been bombarding Fort Powell, one of the
defences of Mobile.</p>
<p>It is reported that 20,000 Confederates are advancing from Texas
towards Western Louisiana. Active dispositions are being made by the
Federals to check this movement. The Federals are also sending
reinforcements to hold Jacksonville, Florida, but have abandoned
further expeditions into the interior.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune's</hi> correspondent reports
that the blockade-running at Charleston has been resumed, two or three
steamers entering weekly.</p>
<p>Charges and specifications have been filed by Secretary Welles
against Admiral Wilkes for disobedience of orders in taking and
keeping the Vanderbilt far his flag-ship, when he knew that she was
ordered on special service in South America; in refusing to send the
Oneida and and Cuyler to Farragut; for insubordination in going off
with the Vanderbilt to Laguayra when he should have remained about the
Bahamas, cruising for rebel privateers; for disrespectful language to
his superior officer in writing an insubordinate and saucy letter to
Secretary Welles; for disobedience of the naval regulations forbidding
publication of official communications in giving a New York paper a
copy of the above letter, and procuring it to be published therein;
and conduct unbecoming an officer in refusing to tell the Department
how old he was.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill authorising
Mr. Chase to anticipate the payment of interest on the public debt,
but not to sell gold.</p>
<p>The President had signed the whisky bill. It imposes a tax of sixty
cents per gallon on all domestic-manufactured liquors from the passing
of the Act, and forty cents on imported spirits on hand.</p>
<p>A bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives to
secure to persons in the military or naval services of the United
States homesteads on confiscated or forfeited estates in
insurrectionary districts. It proposes to give to all persons who have
been discharged therefrom by reason of wounds received or disease
contracted therein eighty acres or a less quantity of the
unappropriated lands, in conformity with the provisions of the
Homestead Act. The bill was ordered to be printed.</p>
<p>In Congress Senator Pomeroy has advocated the claims of Secretary

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, March</hi> 26, 1864.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> this period of the year, when, after
befitting attention to the most serious of all concerns, the mind of
our people turns upon social and lawful enjoyment, it is impossible
not to think (with deep regret for those who are differently engaged)
upon the unhappy condition of our American brethren. A few words in
explanation of the present state of the war may not be inappropriate,
now that the war itself appears to have reached a point of temporary
stoppage.</p>
<p>The new campaign opened with a series of boldly-conceived but
badly-executed movements on the part of the Federals. General Sherman
set out from Vicksburg for a rush eastward, and Admiral Farragut made
an assault of some kind at the entrance of the bay of Mobile, in the
extreme south, in order to distract the attention of the
Confederates. Both efforts appear to have signally failed. The sea
attack was useless, and has given new courage to the South; and
Sherman, who certainty dashed with great courage into a terrible
danger, was not seconded by the assistance on which he seems to have
relied. Had he succeeded, a most important gain would have accrued to
the Federals, by the acquisition of a large portion of Alabama and of
Georgia, with the Confederate arsenals and stores. As it is, we are by
no means informed how far Sherman proceeded; but he was soon met by
the enemy, suffered at least two defeats, and retreated to
Vicksburg. Rumuour said that he had suffered most tremendous loss;
but, except that the absence of authorised contradiction, usually so
ready, gives us reason to believe that there may be foundation for
such reports, we cannot form an opinion upon this part of the
story. The Confederate cavalry had again shown its vigour and the
ability with which it is handled; and though, as one of our military
writers said years ago, "more men are killed in an hour of musquetry
than in a day of galloping and sabring," the carnage must, at some
points, have been frightful. Moreover, the other attempt which was
made against Lee has even more conspicuously failed, and the Federal
force had to make its escape as best it might, leaving large numbers
behind it, either killed or prisoners. Nothing, in fact, could well be
more disastrous than the way the Federals have opened the war this new
year.</p>
<p>Such is the state of military affairs in America while we English
are preparing for a national holiday. The condition of political
matters there affords also a great contrast to that of our own. We
have had party fights; but no principle is at stake, and the
confidence of the country is given generously and fully to the veteran
statesman at the head of the Government--a man whom the bitterest
enemies of the Cabinet do not venture to say they desire to
displace. Our Parliament has done nothing since its meeting, for the
best of all reasons--it has had little or nothing to do; and if it has
occupied itself with wrangles it is because men are impatient of
idleness and will combat on trifles rather than sit silent. Were the
honour of the country at stake, or were a domestic interest in
question, we should speedily see patriotism take the place of
petulance. But the northern part of America is simply given up to
electioneering intrigue, and to all its treacheries and evil
influences. That unhappy arrangement, by which it becomes impossible
for the Americans to elect one of their best and ablest men, and which
compels them to fix upon some person for Chief Magistrate whom chief
merit is that nobody knows much about him, is not to be laid to the
present generation as a fault, though none will deny that it is a
misfortune. There is not one of the reputed candidates for the
presidency who, by any stretch of words, can be called a first-rate
man. But America is evidently longing for a military dictator, one who
will place a strong foot upon the miserable intriguers who make her
success in peace or in war an impossibility, and one who with a strong
hand will force the revolted States into submission. The two favourite
names are those of M'Clellan and of Grant, and, though neither has met
with disasters enough to disqualify him from popularity, neither has
done anything to justify his being raised to the headship of a mighty
country. It seems probable, however, that a military ruler may be more easily obtained than a successful commander. Mr. Lincoln's friends are strong, and he has the advantage of possession, and it may be fairly said that his chances are at present the best. But all presents a sorry prospect for our American brethren, and both North and South have the sincerest sympathies of all who are sincere in their observance of the season which is now passing.</p></div2>

<p>The President, by an official order promulgated on the 14th ult.,
assigned Lieutenant-General Grant to the command of all the armies of
the United States. General Halleck, who is, at his own request,
relieved from duty as General-in-Chief, is assigned to duty in
Washington as Chief of Army Staff. Major-General W. T. Sherman is
assigned to the command of the military division of the Mississippi,
embracing the departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,
and the Arkansas. Major General M'Pherson is assigned to the command
of the department and army of the Tennessee. In relieving General
Halleck from duty as General-in-Chief, the President expresses his
thanks and approbation "for the able and zealous manner in which the
arduous and responsible duties of that position have been
performed."</p>
<p>There seems to be a strong impression on both sides that General
Grant is about to inaugurate a vigorous campaign in Virginia; and the
Confederates are said to be concentrating an army of observation in
North Carolina to watch the southern part of James River, in which
direction they anticipate the Northern legions will appear.</p>
<p>The Federals are concerting expeditions against Shreveport,
Louisiana, and the trans-Mississippi region.</p>
<p>General Sherman, who had gone to New Orleans to consult with
General Banks, has arrived at Nashville to assume his new
command. General Sherman was said to have done immense damage to
Confederate property in his late raid--to have destroyed 150 miles of
railway, and to have brought 10,000 negroes with him to Vicksburg; but
we are not told anything respecting the losses sustained by him.</p>

<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> months ago I rode through the log and
canvas city illustrated in the Engraving on the preceding page and as
I left it I lingered for a few minutes to make a farewell
sketch. There was much of sorrow in the feelings that governed me at
that moment. I was looking, perhaps for the last time, on the camp
that sheltered men who had been my companions for nearly two
years. What thoughts crowded on me then--what a kaleidoscope of great
events whirled through my recollection. Many a gallant deed and many a
well-fought field that I had witnessed with my Southern friends were
reviewed rapidly as I rose in my saddle and waved a trembling
adieu. There curled the blue smoke from the tent of Robert E. Lee,
whose hand I had just shaken, and whose friendship I am proud to own;
there were the quarters of the gallant Stuart, whose guest I had been
for the past few days, and whose hospitality in the field I had
enjoyed for many months. Yes; every soldier of the army of Northern
Virginia was a comrade; we had marched many weary miles together, and
I had shared in some of their dangers. This brought me nearer to them
than years of ordinary contact could have done; and now, as I looked
on their camp for perhaps the last time, I realised painfully and
forcibly the many friends who were lying there, some of whom would
breathe their last in the first glad sunshine of coming spring. Not
only did I survey the camp of the living, but around me, on every side
as far as the eye could reach, lay spread the battle-fields of
Virginia; and in many a distant clump of pine wood slept their last
sleep those whom I had known in life. <hi rend="italic">Requiescant in
pace</hi>. Far away in the background, tipped with snow, towered the
mountains of the Blue Ridge, every pass of which bears the imprint of
the dead hero, Stonewall Jackson, and of the gallant men who fought
with him in the valley of the Shenandoah that lies beyond. Through
these passes were made some of those wonderful flank movements which
for celerity and success have challenged the admiration of the
world. There, within the eye's glance, lay a classic ground, crimsoned
with deeds that will make history for the future. The camp which now
looked so calm and peaceful in the clear winter's sunshine, with
naught to disturb the quiet but the stroke of the pioneer's axe
cutting fuel for the bivouac fire, would in a few short weeks be
broken up. Across the Rapidan, which flows beyond the nearer crest of
hills, lay the enemy, only waiting probably the first approach of
spring to renew the awful drama that has spread desolation over many a
once smiling acre of Virginian soil. As I grasped the hands of my
friends at leavetaking, they knew that the present lull was but the
forerunner of a coming storm; every man amongst them spoke hopefully
and confidently of the future, and here, dispassionately, will I
assert that, whatever be the result of the approaching campaign, I am
confident that General Lee and his veterans will have done their
duty. And now, while bidding farewell to an army with which I have
been associated for a lengthened period, let me take an opportunity of
thanking all those officers and soldiers whose guest I have been
during my sojourn in the Confederacy. From the Rappahannock to the
banks of Yazoo in Mississippi, from the Tennessee to the Atlantic
seaboard, every detachment, every Southern command, has received me
with unvarying courtesy and wholesouled hospitality; what they have
had has been cheerfully shared with your correspondent. To procure me
facilities great warriors and "medicine men" have not hesitated to
inconvenience themselves where necessary, and if your readers have not
benefited as they might have done by my experiences, it is the fault
of a rigorous blockade which has intercepted much destined for your
pages.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> have been favoured by Commander Allen
Young, R.N., with a sketch taken by himself when on board the
Kwan-Tung war-steamer, of which he was in command during her voyage
from Singapore to Bombay, on the 24th of December last. On leaving
Singapore New Harbour, early in the morning of that day, he observed
the Confederate man-of-war Alabama at the same time leaving the
harbour at full speed, and steering through the straits to the
westward. On passing several vessels working through the Narrows, the
Alabama showed foreign colours and was soon afterwards lost sight of
in the thick rain and mist. At five in the afternoon, the Kwan-tung
again came suddenly upon the Alabama, which, having captured a
barque, was then in the act of destroying her, as shown in the sketch
we have engraved. This barque, which proved to be the Texan Star,
alias the Martaban, bound to Singapore with a rice cargo, was then
lying in the position which our Engraving represents; her sails were
clewed up, her anchor was down in about fifteen fathoms water, and the
fire was breaking out at both ends. The crew having been removed, the
Alabama cut the barque's boat adrift and steamed away at full speed to
the northwest until midnight, when she was seen suddenly to alter her
course towards Malacca, where it appears she landed the captured
crew. The Texan Star when last seen was one mass of flame fore and
aft, her masts had fallen by the board, and, while fast burning to the
water's edge, she cast through the intense darkness of the night a
brilliant gleam of light, at once a beacon to the navigator and a
warning to all Federal ships in those waters.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">CAMP OF FEDERAL PRISONERS ON BELLE ISLE,<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> late raid of General Kilpatrick and
Colonel Dahlgren in the neighbourhood of Richmond, which resulted in a
disastrous check and the death of Colonel Dahlgren, is still fresh in
the minds of our readers. It will also be remembered that one of the
prime objects of the expedition was to effect the release of the
Federal prisoners now held in the capital of the Southern
Confederacy. The Engraving which we publish this week shows the camp
in which these Federal prisoners are confined. Our Special Artist and
Correspondent gives the following description of his Sketch:--"For
some time the cartel regulating the exchange of prisoners between the
North and South has been in abeyance, the Federal and Confederate
commissioners being at issue on a point of objection raised by the
Lincoln Administration. The result of this misunderstanding has been a
large increase of the captives on each side, and in Richmond
especially the prisons are full to overflowing. In fact, those
buildings originally set aside for the accommodation of prisoners of
war in the Confederate capital have been found insufficient for the
purpose, and the authorities, to provide a remedy, have established a
camp of d&#x00E9;tenus on Belle Isle. This is the largest of the
numerous islands that intersect the channel of the James River, in the
immediate neighbourhood of Richmond, and is well adapted for the
purpose to which it has been destined. A swift and turbulent current
separates it from either shore, and bold, indeed, would be the swimmer
who would risk himself amidst the eddies that hiss and boil on their
way to the deeps below. Besides, its position allows of a cordon of
sentries around its entire circumference, and these are within
challenging distance of each other, making it next to impossible to
pass through them unperceived. In addition to this, the camp occupied
by the prisoners is intrenched, and there is an inner line of guards
pacing around its outskirts, with imperative orders to shoot the first
man who attempts to cross the embankment. On a commanding eminence
close at hand is a detachment of artillerymen, with a shotted gun
frowning on the tents beneath, and at the first sign of an outbreak
the iron messengers of death would plough their way though the
confused mass of insubordinates. Again, on each bank of the river, are
other guns, placed in a position to enfilade the island, and they are
kept in readiness for any emergency that may arise. When I visited
Belle Isle, at the latter end of January, there were more than 7000
prisoners in the camp, all of whom were rank and file from the Federal
armies of Virginia and Tennessee. The officers are confined in the
"Libby," a large and well-ventilated building formerly used as a
tobacco warehouse--since it has been found politic to separate the
private soldier from his commissioned superior. At the time I mention,
the Northern journals wore filled with accounts of barbarities
practised by the Confederates upon those whom the fate of war had
placed in their hands, and I was anxious to judge for myself of the
correctness of these statements. Let your readers determine from my
statement whether the charge of cruelty can he established:--The
rations which I saw distributed to the prisoners were in every respect
the same as those issued to the Southern soldier; possibly the former
may get more fresh meat, and that, I apprehend, is scarcely a ground
for objection. They certainly do not get such luxuries as coffee or
sugar, but then the Confederates themselves are no better off with
respect to these condiments, which, indeed, are only to be procured in
the Southern States at such ruinous blockade prices as to prevent
their finding their way into the commissariat of the Southern
army. The doctor's report, on the day I visited the island, will also
serve to indicate that the treatment to which the prisoners are
subjected is not such as to affect their health. I am convinced your
readers will be astounded when I tell them that, out of 7000 of these
<hi rend="italic">cruelly</hi>-used captives, the sick-list only gave
thirteen in hospital. Why, I have known, in one morning's report, as
many as seventy-five or a hundred to be returned as unfit for duty out
of a skeleton brigade of fifteen hundred, in Bragg's army. After six
months' confinement of these Federal prisoners at Belle Isle, there
were only seventy-five graves to indicate the number of those who had
died under the privations to which they are said to have been
subjected! Any Adjutant-General of a division of 5000 men in Lee's
army could show a very different bill of mortality from sickness and
hardship embracing a corresponding period. I think that these
statements should go a great way to disprove the charges made by the
Northern press. The Northern journals have undoubtedly been
misinformed in this particular, and it is only an act of justice on my
part to dispel from your readers' minds any wrong impressions they may
have formed as to the treatment which the Federal prisoners meet with
at the hands of the Confederates. The point from which my sketch is
taken affords a capital view of Richmond; and this must be my excuse
for almost repeating a drawing of the city which appeared in your
Journal many months ago. The bridge that crosses the river just below
Belle Isle is known as the Petersburg Bridge, and it connects the
Southern Railroad with the metropolis of the Southern
Confederacy."</p></div2>

<p>An order from the War Department has been promulgated by General

corps. There had been no important movement in Virginia; but the
Confederates were believed to be strengthening their positions on the
Rapidan, and General Grant was at Fortress Monroe, where he was

<p>The expedition up the Red Riyer at latest date was making por<pb

Confederates on the north and south of the river were concentrating at
Shrevesport. Fort de Russy was accidentally blown up , killing four
men. A reconnaissance seventy-five miles above Alexandria engaged the
Confederates, capturing 200 prisoners and four pieces of
artillery.</p>
<p>An attack by the Confederate General Forrest upon Union City,
Western Tennessee, on the 24th ult., resulted in the capture of the
town and 500 Federals. Immediately afterwards, Forrest entered
Kentucky, and on the 25th occupied Paducah, on the Ohio River, from
which he removed many valuable spoils. He also attacked the fort, but
for want of heavy cannon was compelled to desist. Two Federal
gun-boats from Cairo opened fire to dislodge his forces, during which
a large portion of the city was destroyed. Forrest then retired to
Eddysville, thirty-five miles east of Paducah.</p>
<p>A conflict between the soldiers and civilians (or, as another
despatch says, between Copperheads and Republicans) occurred at
Charleston, Illinois, on the 28th ult., in which between twenty and
thiry contrabands were killed or wounded. The civilians (Copperheads)
were driven from the town, but have intrenched themselves at Gidding's
Mills. Outbreaks in other districts in Illinois are also
threatened. General Heintzelman,  commanding that department has
called for 5000 troops to suppress insurrection.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">NASSAU, NEW PROVIDENCE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">With</hi> reference to the annexed Engraving
of the capital of the Bahamas, our Special Artist and Correspondent
writes as follows:--"Nassau at the present moment is a point of very
great interest indeed, being the head-quarters of the
Anglo-Confederate blockade-runners; and at no time, I presume, has its
harbour shown so much activity as now. The enterprise of British
merchants has lined its quays with long light-coloured, rakish-looking
steamers, discharging their rich freights of cotton that have run the
gauntlet through the Federal cruisers off Wilmington. The voyage from
the Confederate States to Nassau averages about fifty hours; but then
these fifty hours are fraught with an excitement that a voyage of
fifty days would fail in producing. From the time of leaving Cape Fear
River, Wilmington, to the time of sighting Nassau and getting into
British waters, these adventurous craft are never safe from being
overhauled by a Northern man-of-war. Many a feat of heroism has been
displayed by the plucky Englishmen who command them, and I have known
instances of a vessel being chased and fired into for an entire day,
and the only answer given in reply was to display the British ensign
more proudly than ever. Of course the owners of these ships are,
strictly speaking, violating the neutrality which her Majesty's
Government has proclaimed; but, for all that, we Englishmen may well
be proud of the spirit of enterprise shown by our countrymen, who set
at defiance the guns of the Federalists, and turn a blockaded harbour
into an open port. Nassau is the point whence most of the blockaders
start with the cargoes destined for the Southern Confederacy, and it
is here that they return with their bales of Sea Island and Upland
cotton which they have obtained in exchange for the rifles, blankets,
and shoes so much needed by the Southern soldier. The climate of the
Bahamas, of which New Providence is one of the group, is almost
tropical; and pleasant, indeed, to your Correspondent was the change
from the wintry weather which he had experienced on the banks of the
Rapidan. Oranges, shaddocks, bananas, cocoanuts, pineapples and many
other varieties of fruit abound, and lovely to the eye is the
diversity of foliage in which the charming bungalow residences are
embedded. The people of the place, led by their popular Governor and
his lady, are the most hospitable I have ever met; and the officers of
the 1st West India Regiment, stationed at Nassau, are the best set of
men it has been my chance to fall in with on a foreign
station."</p></div2>

<p>Master Willie Pape, the celebrated young American pianist, has been
playing at Liverpool with extraordinary success. At a concert at
St. George's Hall, on Saturday last, he performed, among other pieces,
Thalberg's serenade from "Don Pasquale," Beethoven's sonata in E flat,
and Thalberg's fantasias on "Lucia," and "Mos&#x00E8; in Egitto,"
intermingling these classical compositions with curious and
interesting specimens of American and negro music. "Master Pape," says
a Liverpool journal, "has a touch of equal softness and brilliancy;
his execution seems equal to any difficulty; his repertoire is varied
and abundant; his style, though it has yet to reach the poetical
maturity of one or two of our greatest masters of the piano, is
characterised by intelligence, appreciation, and feeling, while it is
wholly devoid of the tricksiness usually found with prodigies; and to
all his other merits he adds a memory which enables him to dispense
with his music throughout the whole of his wonderful
programme."</p></div2>

<p>Information has been received in London respecting an enormous
theft of bar gold, worth &#x00A3;50,000, from the sunken steamer
Golden Gate, near San Francisco. The Golden Gate was wrecked in July,
1862, having on board &#x00A3;450,000 worth of gold and specie. The
underwriters by whom the vessel had been insured dispatched an agent
to the scene of the wreck, and a party of men who recovered about
&#x00A3;50,000 worth of bar gold decamped with it. It is believed that
most of the booty has been forwarded to London. One of the suspected
thieves has been taken into custody.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, April 9, Morning.--A slight
engagement, lasting three hours, occurred on the 28th ult.,
thirty-five miles above Alexandria, Louisiana, between 8000 Federals
and the Confederates, who were estimated 12,000 strong. The Federals
are reported to have captured 500 prisoners, and then continued
advancing, endeavouring to bring on a general engagement. The
confederate ram Tennessee is reported to have sunk at Grant's Pass,
Mobile, during a gale. The Senate has passed a resolution amending the
Constitution so as to abolish slavery. The resolution has yet to pass
the House of Representatives and the State Legislatures. In Louisiana
the election for delegates to the State Constitutional Convention has
resulted in the success of the Free State party. An enormous mass
meeting of working men has been held at New York protesting against
legislative interference with strikes.</p></div2>

<p>The military news from America is of little interest. Heavy rains
had fallen, and neither of the belligerent armies in Virginia had made
any movement; but General Grant had proceeded from Washington to the
Federal head-quarters. The Confederate cavalry was still active in
West Tennessee and Kentucky. The Federal expedition which ascended the
Red River to Alexandria was continuing its advance towards
Shreveport.</p>
<p>The Federal House of Representatives had passed resolutions
deploring recent events in Mexico, and declaring that it can never
accord with American interests to recognise a monarchy established on
the ruins of an American republic under the auspices of a European
State.</p>

<p>General Grant has joined the army of the Potomac. He has issued
orders to revoke all furloughs, to send baggage to the rear, and to
direct sutlers to leave the army, in view of the resumption of active
operation. Continuous rains, however, prevented any immediate
movement. It was rumoured that a threefold advance on
Richmond--namely, by Grant across the Rapidan, Smith up the Peninsula,
and Burnside vi&#x00E2; Goldsborough, North Carolina--has been
determined upon. The army of the Potomac, it is said, has been largely
reinforced. General Meade has moved his headquarters to Culpepper.</p>
<p>On the 12th inst. the Confederates, under General Forrest, attacked
Fort Pillow, a few miles higher up the Mississippi than Memphis; and,
after some fighting, they compelled the garrison of 600 men to
surrender. It was said that they had massacred the garrison. No
certain information had been received, however, relative to this
latter part of the affair. The Confederates had also taken Paducah,
but had been shelled out of it again. The Federal expedition up the
Red River had defeated a body of Confederates near Cane River, and had
taken about 500 prisoners. The Confederate General<pb n="407"/>
Marmaduke, with 3000 men, had made an unsuccessful attack on the
Federal General Steele's division near the little Missouri River. The
Federal Arkansas expedition is advancing towards Texas. It has had two
successful skirmishes.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th the Confederates made an attempt to blow
up the Federal flag-ship Minnesota, off Newport. The Minnesota was
seriously damagaed, but not sunk.</p>
<p>The Federal Senate has passed a resolution in favour of such an
amendment of the Federal Constitution as shall for ever abolish
slavery throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the approval of the
President and the Cabinet, had decided not to support the recent
resolution of the House of Representatives relative to French
operations in Mexico.</p>
<p>A scene has occurred in the Federal House of
Representatives. Mr. Long, of Ohio, spoke in favour of peace,
advocating the immediate recognition of the Southern Confederacy. Next
day Speaker Colfax descended from the chair and moved Mr. Long's
expulsion for treason. Mr. Harris, of Maryland, defended Mr. Long, and
prayed that the South might never be conquered; whereupon
Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, moved the expulsion of
Mr. Harris. Eighty-one votes were in favour and fifty-eight against
the latter motion; but there not being a majority of two thirds, the
motion was lost. A vote of censure on Mr. Harris was immediately
afterwards carried, on the motion of General Schenck, against a
minority of nineteen. The expulsion of Mr. Long was still under
discussion. Several Democratic members declared that they indorsed
Mr. Long's opinions.</p>
<p>there has been almost a panic in the money market. Gold rose to
189, but afterwards declined and closed at 176&#x00BD;.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi rend="smallcaps">Friday,
April 22.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Outrage On A British Subject.</hi>--Lord <hi
rend="smallcaps">R. Cecil</hi> said he wished to put a question to
the Under-Secretary for the Foreign Department relative to an outrage
on a British subject on the Northern coast of America. He wished to
know whether any information had been received by the Foreign Office
on the subject, and, if so, what steps had been taken.--Mr. <hi
rend="smallcaps">Layard</hi> said information had been received
similar to that which appeared in the public press. Correspondence
had been going on between her Majesty's Government and the United
States Government, and redress had been demanded for the outrage.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Tuscaloosa.</hi>--Lord <hi
rend="smallcaps">Chelmsford</hi> called the attention of their
Lordships to the mode in which the Government proposed to deal with
prizes brought by the belligerent Powers of America into ports within
her Majesty's dominions, as described in the correspondence presented
to Parliament with respect to the Tuscaloosa. The noble Lord condemned
the course of procedure contemplated as most objectionable and
dangerous, and totally opposed to the comity of nations.--Earl <hi
rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> observed that the law of nations
required that prizes captured at sea should be legally condemned in
the prize courts of the captors; but the Confederates had no power to
take prizes into their own ports on account of the Federal blockade--a
circumstance which rendered the present war altogether anomalous. He
contended that the captain of a belligerent cruiser had no right to
put guns on board her and claim to have her treated as a commissioned
ship of war. If that could be done, the Confederate cruisers might
dispose of every one of their prizes in her Majesty's ports, and this
would have the effect of at once violating the Royal proclamation and
the neutrality of the country. In his opinion the Government were
bound to regard the Tuscaloosa. as an uncondemned prize; but the law
officers of the Crown felt that under all the circumstances of the
case it would have been sufficient to warn her off. He denied that the
Government had truckled to Federal menaces and threats, and asserted
that whatever demands Ministers had made upon the Federal Government
had been promptly and fairly attended to.--After a short discussion
the subject dropped.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Affairs.</hi>--Sir <hi
rend="smallcaps">G. Grey</hi>, in reply to Mr. Hopwood, said it was
not the intention of the Government to propose a conference of
European Powers on American affairs; that there was no ground for
making such a proposal, as they were certain that the United States
Government would not concur in it.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Tuscaloosa.</hi></p>
<p>On the order of the day for going into Committee of Supply,</p>
<p> Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peacock</hi> called attention to the case
of the Confederate vessel Tuscaloosa, and the instructions to seize
her contained in the despatch of the colonial officer to the Governor
of the Cape of Good Hope, dated the 4th of November last, and which he
held were a weak concession to the menaces and demands of the United
States. The hon. member argued, from the dicta of Sir W. Scott and
other learned jurists on questions of international law, that the
Tuscaloosa was sufficiently clothed with the character of a man-of-war
to exempt her from seizure under the Queen's Proclamation, and that
the commander of the Alabama, who had captured her and converted her
into a Confederate cruiser, had as much right to commission her in
that capacity as a commodore. He charged the Government with cowardice
in evading the responsibility that rested only on themselves and
endeavouring to cast it upon the shoulders of Sir P. Wodehouse. He
complained that the instructions of November remained virtually
unrepealed, and called upon the House to demand their recall; for, if
we enforced them against one Power, we were bound to enforce them
against another; if we acted upon them in the case of a weak Power, we
must likewise do so in the case of a strong Power. Supposing, then, we
applied them against a strong Power, the result must be to plunge the
country into war; and if against a weak Power, it would cover the
country with intolerable shame. It was in the interest of peace that
he invited the House to assist in obtaining a revocation of those
instructions, for as long as they stood unrepealed they were at once a
source of danger and disgrace. In conclusion, the hon. member moved
that the instructions contained in the despatch of the Duke of
Newcastle, dated the 4th of November, 1863, and which remained still
unrevoked, were at variance with the principles of international
law.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Solicitor-General</hi>, in resisting the
motion, observed that at present we were neutrals, but the day might
arrive when we should become belligerents, exercising belligerent
rights; and when we again exercised those rights it might be that
another armed neutrality would be formed against us. It behoved the
House, therefore, to think well before they furnished such an armed
neutrality with weapons forged by ourselves. The question was, whether
the Tuscaloosa, when she entered Simon's Bay, was still a prize to the
Alabama or had lost that character of a vessel of war. There was no
disputing that she was a prize, that she had not been taken into any
port of the Confederate States, for the purpose of being adjudicated
upon; and the evidence showed, moreover, that her supposed conversion
into a Confederate ship of war was a mere sham and pretence. Sir
B. Walker had no doubt about her real character from the first; but he
was overruled by the opinion of the Attorney-General of the Cape. In
his (the Solicitor-General's) opinion there was no doubt but that she
was a prize of war, and that her supposed conversion into a
Confederate cruiser was a mere plan and pretence.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Whiteside</hi> contended that we had
shamefully violated our alleged neutrality, as there could be no doubt
whatever but that the Tuscaloosa was lawfully converted into a tender
to the Alabama, that her Commander had a legal commission, and that we
had no right whatever to detain her. If the Tuscaloosa had been a
prize of the Alabama instead of her tender she ought to have been
warned off, but under no circumstance was her seizure to be
justified.</p>
<p>After a lengthened debate, which was chiefly confined to the
members of the legal profession, the House divided, when Mr. Peacock's
motion was defeated by a majority of 219 to 185.</p></div2>

more of our Special Artist's sketches in illustration of the American
war.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Unloading Cotton From
Blockade-Runners At The Port<lb/> Of Nassau.</hi></p>
<p>The first Engraving represents an operation which, though its
locality is the British port of Nassau, in the West Indies, must be
described as an incidental result of the Federal blockade. In our
Journal of April 16 we published a View of Nassau, with one of those
steamboats which frequently escape the vigilance of the Northern
cruisers off Wilmington just entering the neutral harbour in
safety. We now engrave a vessel of this description lying at the wharf
in Nassau and unshipping her valuable freight. The thousand negroes
engaged in this labour make the neighbourhood of the quay resound with
their songs as they heave and haul at the heavy bales; and some,
carried away by their excitement, leap on to the fluffy piles and
relieve themselves by a "break down." As the cotton is usually the
property of English purchasers who have ordered it beforehand in
exchange for their cargoes of English manufactured goods, this
Illustration may be regarded with particular interest by some of our
readers.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General Stuart's Winter Quarters
On The Rapidan.</hi></p>
<p>We will leave our Special Artist to describe in his own words the
second Illustration:--"Probably," he says, "no Southern General is
more frequently heard of in England than the gallant and chivalrous
Stuart, who commands the Confederate cavalry in Virginia. Almost every
mail brings to Europe some tidings of a raid executed by this dashing
leader in the Federal rear, or of the capture of a Yankee supply-train
between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers by some of his daring
horsemen. It is from the tent on the right-hand side of the Engraving
that his orders for "boot and saddle go forth;" and, when once those
orders are abroad, the Federal soldiers get but little rest. However,
as the snow now thickly covers the soil of Virginia, the General is
compelled to an ungrateful idleness, and your Correspondent takes
advantage of the moment's quiet to make the accompanying drawing."
This remark was applicable to the state of the weather in Virginia at
the time our Artist's sketch was made.</p></div2>

<p>By the Peruvian we have news from New York to the 23rd ult.</p>
<p>The transmission of news from Virginia has been stopped by the
Federal Government; and it was consequently supposed that either
General Lee or General Grant had put his army in motion. Confederate
deserters reported that General Longstreet's corps was moving down the
Shenandoah Valley, and that ten days' rations had been issued to
General Lee's army. General Grant had left Washington, for the front,
and General Burnside had gone to Fort Monroe, where large bodies of
Federal troops were arriving from the coast of South Carolina. General
Kilpatrick has been relieved from his command in the army of the
Potomac, and ordered to report to General Sherman. It is reported that
Grant will give M'Clellan an active command.</p>
<p>The Confederates had suddenly assumed the offensive in North
Carolina, and had attacked Plymouth. An attempt made by land on the
17th ult. to take Fort Gray, the work which defends that town, was
unsuccessful; but a "ram"--probably one of the iron-clad steamers
which rumour had for some time asserted that the Confederates were
building up the North Carolina rivers--sank three Federal gun-boats,
and obtained full command of the River Roanoke below Plymouth, thus
intercepting the garrison's communications. Several gun-boats had left
Fort Monroe to aid the Federals, and the garrison of Plymouth was said
to be well supplied with provisions, and to be able to hold out.</p>
<p>In Florida the Federals had abandoned Pilatka, and another of their
transports had been sunk by torpedoes in the St. John's River.</p>
<p>The greater part of the town of Hickman, in Kentucky, had been
burned by Confederate guerrillas.</p>
<p>A severe engagement occurred on the 8th ult., between the advance
of General Banks's army and the Confederates, at Pleasant Hill, beyond
Grand Ecore, Louisiana. The Federal cavalry in front were routed,
causing a demoralised retreat of the infantry in the rear. The 19th
Army Corps of 7000 then advanced, checking the Confederate
progress. The Federals estimate their loss at 2000 men and one
battery. The Confederates, however, estimate the Federal loss at 4000
men. General Banks's defeat has been confirmed, but there is a report
of a Federal victory achieved on the following day. Of this, however,
there is no confirmation in the latest news. The Confederates attacked
the Federal fleet designed to co-operate with Banks, but were repulsed
with great loss.</p>
<p>The Federals have been driven from Big Black River, with the loss
of several hundred prisoners.</p>
<p>A committee had been appointed to inquire into the truth of the
accounts of the massacre by the Confederates at Fort Pillow; and
President Lincoln had declared that if those accounts were true he
would order some retaliation to be made, though he could not yet
determine the form or extent of that retaliation. General Sherman
states, in his official report, that the place was taken after a
comparatively slight resistance, during which about 150 of the
garrison were killed and wounded, and 300 of the negro soldiers were
then murdered in cold blood.</p>
<p>The Governors of four Western States, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio,
and Indiana, had arrrived at Washington for the purpose of urging
President Lincoln to call out 200,000 volunteers for six months; and
the Governor of New York had offered the services of the militia for
the occupation of all the Federal forts in that state.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives was debating a tax bill, and Secretary
Chase had declared in a letter that it was necessary to provide by
taxation for at least one half of the Government's expenditure.</p>
<p>Congress was discussing a bill providing for the introduction of
European immigrants, who are to repay to the Federal Government out of
their wages the cost of their passage.</p>
<p>Both Houses of the New York State Legislature have passed a
resolution to pay the interest of the State debts to all creditors in
greenbacks. The Governor has urged the Legislature to reconsider its
resolution to pay the interest of the State debt in currency.</p>
<p>The Lieutenant of the Vanderbildt was being tried by a naval
court-martial at New York for the murder of the mate of the Saxon.</p>
<p>The premium on gold at New York fell on the 21st ult., to 65 per
cent, but on the following day it rose to 75 per cent "under war
rumours, and on account of the Government broker ceasing to sell
gold," and the latest quotation on the 23rd was 77 per cent.</p>
<p>The Official Naval Register for 1864 has just been issued from the
Government press. It reports the number of vessels, including those
still building, to be 617: among them seventy-two ironclads and two
rams--the Avenger and Vindicator. From Dec. 31, 1862, to March 6,
1864, the navy had lost thirty-nine vessels by capture, destruction,
snagging, wreck, &#x0026;c., including six ironclads and three
rams.</p></div2>

<p>The steamer City of Baltimore brings news from New York to the 30th
ult. At that date neither General Lee nor General Grant had made any
movement. General Lee was being strongly reinforced from all quarters,
and General Burnside was preparing to co-operate with General
Grant. General Longstreet is reported to have taken up a position on
the left of Lee's army.</p>
<p>The defeat sustained by the Red River expedition was admitted to
have been more disastrous than the first accounts represented it to
be; for it was stated that General Banks had lost 4000 prisoners,
thirty guns, a gun-boat, and 1,000 00 dols. in "greenbacks." The
Confederates were reported to be marching upon Grand Ecore, where his
troops were strongly intrenched.</p>
<p>The Confederates have achieved a success in North Carolina. On the
20th of April General Hoke assaulted Plymouth, and captured it with
1500 prisoners and thirty guns. It was said that the Confederates
repeated their Fort Pillow brutalities, and massacred 150 negro
soldiers after they had surrendered.</p>
<p>Among the miscellaneous items of news, it may be chronicled that
President Lincoln has accepted the offer of the Governors of
Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Iowa, to furnish 100,000
volunteers for a hundred days for fortification and frontier duty.</p>
<p>The import duties have been increased 50 per cent for sixty
days.</p>
<p>A "draught" of 8850 men had been ordered to take place on the 3rd
of May, in the State of New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Senate of the State of New York had refused to take into
consideration Governor Seymour's remonstrance against the resolution
that the interest of the State debt shall be paid in "greenbacks."</p>
<p>The price of gold was greatly and constantly fluctuating in New
York; but the latest quotation was 79 per cent premium.</p>
<p>After a prosperous existence of three weeks, the Great Sanitary
Fair at New York, for the benefit of the wounded soldiers and of the
widows and children of the slain, was brought to a close on the 23rd
of April. The receipts were nearly 1,100,000 dols.</p>
<p>The American papers record the death of Mr. G. T. Ticknor, the
famous Boston publisher.</p>
<p>A letter from Nassau states that between November, 1861, and March
10, 1864, 425 attempts were made from that port alone to run the
blockade, and that 363 of these adventures proved
successful.</p></div2>

off, which are worth about 4s., the hoofs fetch 8s., the tail 2s.; the

<p>....The very decided victories achieved by the Southern
Confederacy, the news of which arrives just as we are putting their
shipowners on trial as pirates; the facts that they dominate the
Mississippi, have crushed Banks, keep Grant in check, and have retaken
and hold at least six important forts, the possession of which
relieves their chief city and makes it safer than Washington itself;
these facts have brought forward Mr. W. S. Lindsay, who proposes that
now the time has arrived for an open recognition of the Southern
States as an independent nation. Why not? It is useless to conceal the
fact that their conquest is utterly hopeless. The Northern States,
taxed to their utmost, are staggering on in a fool's paradise,
believing, probably, that their debts will never be paid, that
repudiation will be easy, or that the "resources" of America are so
enormous that she will quickly recover.</p>
<p>Among the curious items which we receive from New York are two
somewhat noteworthy. The first is that Lieutenant Danenhower (not
Donovan, we are told with emphasis) has been acquitted of the murder
of Mr. Gray, of the ship Saxon. Our readers will remember that this
Federal officer had a habit of shooting people down, and that he shot
on inoffensive English mate in an English ship which the Yankees had
overhauled. No one supposed that a New York jury would have condemned
him; and yet it "yerks one," as Lord Burleigh has it, to see Murder
walk away scot-free! The other is that the Confederates amongst
Banks's baggage took one million of dollars in greenbacks. Now, a
million to English ears is a great fact. So it is--in pounds; it falls
to a fifth in dollars, and in greenbacks to nothing. A few revolutions
of the Government printing-machines and all the "treasure" will be
replaced....</p>
<p>Three queer books were hatched last week--a new edition of
Disraeli's Revolutionary Epic; a revelation of the doings of three
months in an English monastery (which, by-the-way, is far less
comfortable than an English workhouse, not to mention a prison) under
the guidance of Father Ignatius; and "Manhattan's" novel. The latter
holds such sins within its cloth covers that Mr. Mudie--a volunteer
<hi rend="italic">Expurgator Indicis</hi>--has withdrawn it from his
readers; a conscientious act, for which, however questionable the
result is he is to be honoured. Manhattan dedicates his farrago of
clotted Americanisms to James Gordon Bennett, of the <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, a person whom he has himself very
plentifully bespattered with abuse....</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 4th inst. No collision had down
to that time taken place between the hostile armies in Virginia. There
were rumours that General Grant had put his troops in motion, but it
was quite uncertain whether there was any foundation for them. The
Federals had evacuated Washington, in North Carolina; and the
Confederates were reported to have invested Newbern. General
Beauregard was said to have assumed the chief command of the
Confederate forces in North Carolina. General Banks had retreated down
the Red River as far as Alexandria, where his gun-boats and
transports, with the exception of the gun-boat Eastport, had also
arrived. Nothing was known respecting the position of General Steele's
corps, which had advanced from Arkansas in order to co-operate with
General Banks in attacking Shreveport. The Confederates had captured
and burned the Federal gun-boat Petrel two miles above Yazoo City.</p>
<p>The Washington ladies have organised a patriotic association, of
which the objects are thus summarised by the <hi rend="italic">New
York World</hi>, in its "sensation headings" to a report of the
inaugural meeting:--"No more foreign goods. Formation of a ladies
covenant. Flora M'Flimsey to be put in Coventry. Hon. Mrs. Shoddy in a
new dress. No imported jewellry, diamonds, silks, opera-cloaks, laces,
or loves of bonnets. What is asked of the men? The ladies demand that
they shall give up imported wines, liquors, and cigars. The social
revolution. Ladies to drink catnip tea and the men Jersey
lightning. French boots and Paris lapdogs to be kicked out
altogether." As stated by themselves, the object of the meeting,
composed of the wives of members of the Cabinet and of Senators and
representatives, of well-known authoresses, women of fashion, mothers
who had lost their sons, and wives who had lost their husbands, is to
"unite the women of the country in the earnest resolution to purchase
no imported articles of apparel where American can possibly be
substituted during the continuance of the war." The name of the
association was declared to be "the Ladies National Covenant," and "a
black bee, with wings enamelled according to nature," selected as the
badge of the covenant, "to be worn with a tricolour ribbon a little in
front of the left shoulder." After transacting its business, the
meeting, at the instance of a gentleman present, "delayed adjournment
till photographed."</p>
<p>Admiral Wilkes, the officer concerned in the Trent affair, has come
to professional disgrace. He has been found guilty by court-martial of
disobedience of orders, negligence in obeying orders, disrespectful
language to his superior officer, refusal of obedience to the general
orders issued by the Secretary of the Navy, and other conduct
unbecoming an officer. He was sentenced to be publicly reprimanded by
the Secretary of the Navy, and to be suspended for three years.</p>

office:--</p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center">[Per the Bremen.]</p>
<p rend="right">New York, May 7, Morning.</p>
<p>General Grant's campaign against Richmond has commenced.</p>
<p>General Meade's army crossed the Rappahannock on the 4th, meeting
with no opposition. He advanced on the 5th to Chancellorsville and
Wilderness, where, after heavy skirmishing, Lee was found in force in
the Federal front. On the night of the 5th the position of Meade's
army was parallel with, and a little in advance of, the road from
Germania Ford to Chancellorsville, both flanks resting on those
points, with the general head-quarters at Wilderness. It was
understood Meade would make a general attack on the following
morning. Heavy firing was heard on the morning of the 6th, but no
details of the result of the engagement have been received. The
co-operating column, under the command of Generals Couch and Siegel,
have marched from Winchester up the Shenandoah Valley.</p>
<p>The troops under General Butler were landed at City Point, on the
James River, on the 5th. Monitors and gun-boats co-operate in Butler's
movement against Richmond.</p>
<p>General Beauregard is at Petersburg with 30,000 men to oppose
Butler.</p>
<p>The Federals also occupy West Point, on the peninsula.</p>
<p>The following particulars of some skirmishing by General Meade, on
the morning of the 5th have been received. The Confederates having
appeared in force on the Federal right, near Chancellorsville and
Wilderness, the Federal cavalry on the Orange Court House road were
driven in with severe loss. Griffiths's division advancing on the
right was met by the Confederates under General A. P. Hill, supported
by General Ewell, and a severe action ensued, the Federals capturing
300 prisoners and losing two guns. General Hancock's corps, while
marching to the Federal right to connect with Warren, was attacked by
General Longstreet's full corps, supported by Ewell. Hancock held his
position for two hours, under a severe fire of musketry, by which he
suffered severely, but inflicted considerable damage on the
enemy. These skirmishes showing Lee's whole force to be in the Federal
front, Meade ordered his line of battle to be held till the
mornning. Previous to the advance, General Meade issued an address
cautioning the men who refused to do duty on the ground of their term
of service having expired that unless they returned to their duty they
would be shot down without trial.</p>
<p>General Sherman's army commenced moving on the 5th from Chattanooga
towards northern Alabama and Georgia.</p>
<p>The column under General Steele has returned to Little Rock,
followed and harassed by the Confederates, who were expected to attack
that place.</p>
<p>The Federals burned Washington, North Carolina, at the time of the
evacuation.</p>
<p>The Confederate rams are expected to attack the Federal fleet off
Newbern.</p>
<p>Southern despatches state that General Forrest had captured
Decatur, Tennessee, killing the whole garrison.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter has blown up the gun-boat East Port in the Red
River, and whilst returning to Alexandria the attacks by the
Confederates compelled him to destroy two transports.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that General Banks was compelled to blow up fifteen
gun-boats and transports at Alexandria and Grand Ecore. Other accounts
state that he had a successful engagement between those places.</p>
<p>A Congressional Committee of Congress has issued a report stating
that the massacre by General Forrest, after the capture of Decatur,
had been confirmed by personal investigation.</p>
<p>Gold was 72 per cent premium.</p></div2>

are recorded some recent observations of this star discovered by the
American astronomer, Mr. Alvan Clark. The Rev. W. Dawes says that on
March 24 the air was rather thick, yet the image of Sirius was
unusually still and well defined, and, although the companion was
faint, yet there could be little doubt of its being really a
star. After taking some trouble, he was enabled to estimate the
distance from the latter to the centre of Sirius to be about ten
seconds. On the 25th he was enabled to confirm the reality of the
preceding observation. Mr. Lassell gives, in the same periodical, a
few measures of the position and distance of the companion obtained by
Mr. Marth and himself.</p></div2>

<p>....There was a great House gathered then, particularly on the
Opposition side, because Mr. Thomas Baring, who is the Emperor of the
Barings, was formally to indict those favouritising speculators in
ships and guns who have enabled the Confederate States of America to
capture and destroy so many of those little comforts, including
munitions of war, which strictly neutral British merchants, of whom
the house of Baring had, however, never heard, were daily sending in
vast quantities to the Federals. In general, Mr. Thomas Baring is an
impressive speaker. He rarely addresses the House, and then only in a
few energetic, well-poised sentences, which come with effect from one
possessing a fine rich voice; but on this occasion he had undertaken
to state and to argue a case, probably, if not certainly, with some
foregone conclusions in his mind which were not calculated to render
him facile of ratiocination or ready of utterance; and so he rather
rumbled and stumbled on, and one seemed to hear nothing but the rich
voice. He laboured at his case also too long; there were half a dozen
points at which he might have left off with effect; but he did not,
and somehow there was a feeling that there was a break-down somewhere,
and the way was well cleared for the masterly and most singularly
judicious speech of the Attorney-General. In this instance Sir
Roundell Palmer exhausted all the skill of an advocate, for he managed
so as not to seem--and, indeed, not to be--an advocate at all, as he
stated each side of the case so fairly, admitted where admissions were
required so fully, and held fast so steadily to opinions which he
felt, and which he caused his audience to feel to be sound, that no
one had in reality a word to say; and practically the debate lapsed
then, for the efforts which were made to prolong it were comparatively
brief; and, though Mr. W. E. Forster's speech was one full of matter,
it could not stir up an adversary after Sir Hugh Cairns had declined
to tempt the combat with his great professional and Parliamentary
rival. It will thus be seen that the House had been got exactly into
the vein which made the count out of Morritt on the malt tax
inevitable.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....The approaching hot summer will no doubt play an important
political part. The weather, if commanded by Generals Storm, Sunshine,
Blight, or Eclipse, from that which separated the combatants at
Sardis, or that which Tacitus tells us quelled the revolted Roman
legionaries, has had a great effect upon the fighting men. In New York
even the women are coming to the rescue, and at a political meeting,
resolved to discourage luxury, to wear mere homespun, and to eat and
drink only of Northern products. If this movement be universal,
farewell the fifty per cent import duties, farewell the revenue
therefrom, and farewell, too, the traders' enthusiasm for the war. The
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> tries to ridicule this very natural
meeting of "mothers who had lost sons, widows who had lost husbands,
and literary ladies" in New York. We see, however, no footing for
ridicule. Our own men and women have done the same thing, and would do
it again in spite of Gladstone's treaty; nay, would vote in favour of
our own Coventry ribbons, Woodstock gloves, Spitalfields silks, and
British beer against all Continental importations. Moreover, this
meeting of women, who associated in huge numbers, are to wear a Bee
brooch with a tricoloured ribbon on the left breast, means something
else. It means peace. Wives who have husbands in the field, and
mothers who have sons alive, will join the un-childed and the widows
whose bitter experience have taught them the hopelessness of this
war. Woman in America is fond of classical illusions, or, rather, of
references to Drs. Goldsmith and Lempri&#x00E8;re. The armies are now
facing each other on the Rapidan and elsewhere. Could not a ready
cohort of New England matrons emulate the example of the Sabine women,
who saved their husbands, their brothers, and their fathers from
useless internecine slaughter?</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE WAR IN<lb/> AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Those</hi> political seers whose ken enables
them at a glance to comprehend the exact position of American affairs
inform us, with an air of authority,that the campaign which has just
commenced in Virginia is to be the last of the war between the Federal
and Confederate parties. The events of the first few days of the
renewal of hostilities alone would suffice to sanctify a fervent wish
on the part of all thinking men that the prediction may be
verified. If the dispute between these belligerent brethren is to be
settled by competitive slaughter, most assuredly a great deal has been
already done towards its solution. Making every allowance for a
natural, and still more for an American, tendency to exaggeration, the
numbers of slain in these last battles on the road to Richmond are
such as to lead to a belief that the exhaustion of both parties is a
question of a very precisely given time. Nothing has more struck the
general mind of Europe in the contemplation of the civil war in
America than the vastness of the hosts which have been brought
together in the shock of battle. Notwithstanding the felicitous
faculty of the Anglo-Saxon race for increase, which has been duly
developed in the United States, as compared with its extent of
territory, America is a thinly populated country. As a rule, its male
population has not been more than adequate to the requirements of its
industry; and, taking this fact also into consideration, it is really
marvellous that in this later period of a war of desolation and
extermination, armies on such gigantic scales should be brought into
collision, that one side alone confesses to a loss of 40,000 men. At
this rate, the recruiting of the whole world, if it were attainable,
would soon be insufficient to meet the insatiable demands of the
Transatlantic Bellona.<pb n="510"/> Beyond the immediate influence of
the hot passions which inflame the partakers in this direful contest
there can be but one wish, and that is, that the time is really
approaching when this awful sacrifice of human life may be stayed.</p>
<p>The mode in which the news of the events of the American war has
reached this country has always been akin to that by which the writers
of serial stories contrive to stop short in each number at a
sensational point in order to keep interest alive until the issue of
the next chapters. The mails are always dispatched at some critical
moment of the operations. The situation which was reported at the
beginning of this week, although forming no exception to this rule,
was yet such as to enable an opinion to be formed of the probabilities
of the next week or two. For the first time, the conduct of the
Federal forces has been committed to a commander who, if not exactly a
great general, is a man of resolution and of great tenacity of
purpose, who is capable of forming a plan of military movement and of
adhering to it. The crossing of the Rapidan, and the simultaneous
movement of different Federal corps upon Richmond, were the result of
a matured scheme, and, in the main, its execution was good. With his
usual strategy, which seems to be to tempt his enemy into the exact
position which suits his preconceived plans, the Confederate chief
fell back, and on his own ground awaited the shock of the attack which
Grant delivered with admirable courage and impetuosity on his
front. That Grant was repulsed in this onslaught is shown by the fact
that Lee, in the course of the first day's encounter, assumed the
aggressive, and took his adversary's line in flank, driving it back on
the centre with great loss. During the fearful pause of the following
night, although the advantage may be said to have been with Lee, that
General, having to make a relatively small army do the work of a large
one in the face of a considerable superiority in his foe, wisely
declined to fight again on the same ground, and retired to another and
a still stronger position, against which, for three successive days,
Grant hurled his battalions with persistent vigour, but in vain and
there the accounts received in the early part of this week left the
combatants.</p>
<p>Unquestionably another battle on the same terrible scale as those
of which we know was imminent; but, considering the relative positions
of the contending armies, it hardly seemed possible that it could be a
decisive one. The Confederates were scientifically posted, so that
courage and endurance could be made available almost to security. It
appeared quite possible for them to stand fast and to resist any
attacks which might be made on them, and to keep themselves for an
indefinite period between the direct advance of Grant's army on
Richmond. On the other hand, the Federal General, acting with a unity
of purpose and an independence of will which none of his predecessors
in command seemed to have possessed, in reference to the authority
with which they were invested, with all appliances and means around
him, appears to be fixed in his determination to bring the campaign to
a decisive issue. He is asserted to have said that he will fight it
out even if it take the whole summer, language which, coming from him,
may be taken to indicate a feeling that he is not yet, or not likely
just yet to be, completely victorious. Acting on this resolution, as
the latest accounts inform us, Grant, apparently with unabated vigour,
and well, indeed nobly, seconded by the troops, who feel that they
have at length got a leader who conceives a purpose and holds to it,
brought on another fierce contest. In its result it tended no further
to a decisive issue, and it only developed the continuance of an
evidently predetermined plan on the part of Lee. That General, on the
whole, standing, under great difficulties, his ground to the
termination of this last battle again executed a retiring movement,
left his position at Spottsylvania, crossed the river Po, and occupied
another and, no doubt, strong point, against which Grant will be
compelled to dash himself as he has done on the previous
occasions. That he will take that course is certain; but the tactics
of his opponent remain unimpeached. The Federals have fought their way
twenty miles into the enemy's country; and their march towards their
next battle will still further remove them from the base of their
operations and the source of their supplies, their way lying through a
desolate middle passage, in an exhausted country. Every inch that the
Federals have made in advance has been hardly gained and, as far as
the main features of the war are concerned, the strategical situation
is unchanged.</p>
<p>In the mean time, what may be called the outlying parts of Grant's
plan of an advance on Richmond do not seem to have been more
successful than his own immediate movement. The detached corps moving
on the capital of Virginia are well watched and likely to be
intercepted by sufficient Confederate forces; and anything like a
triumphal march on the destined city is not to be predicated. But
supposing that Lee should find it expedient still to fall back and
occupy Richmond itself, the war would but enter on a new and still
more dilatory phase. We have almost forgotten the way to reckon how
long Charleston has withstood a siege; and it is not easy to calculate
the period during which the Confederates could make a stand around and
within the capital of their new-born Republic.</p>
<p>In considering the chances of the campaign of this summer and its
bearings on the ultimate issue of the contention involved, it must be
remembered that the Federals almost confess to be staking their last
General. It is not necessary to repeat the long list of the men to
whom in succession the command of the chief Northern army has been
committed, and who, one by one, with more or less noise, have what the
Americans themselves would call, burst up. At length, as the Federals
believe, the "comingman" has come; and, while placing implicit trust
in General Grant to retrieve all the errors and to supply all the
incapacity of his predecessors, there is a tacit admission that after
him there is no one. Largely provided, how one can scarcely imagine,
with money, men, and material of war, the Federal hosts have hitherto
been practically without a leader; they did not have the fortune to
possess a chief who could develop their capabilities, and their
numerous battalions have proved but a cumbrous and unmanageable
machine; their ranks have been recruited in immense numbers only to
swell the lists of the slaughtered. Up to the present time Grant must
be said to have justified, to a great extent, the confidence which has
been placed in him; but, looking calmly on the events of the late
battles, there does creep over one a notion that he has exhausted his
strategical ideas in the formation of his preconceived plan for an
advance into Virginia, and that in the actual contest he is acting on
the old system of simply sending men by hundreds of thousands to an
assault upon a resolute foe calmly awaiting attack on their own
well-chosen ground. But whatever fortune may follow this last military
hope of the Federals,--if either by his success or his failure he
should be the means of bringing this fearful internecine quarrel to
such a crisis that the voice of reason and humanity may be heard in
the intervals or at the cessation of the din of battles,--and if by
any means, direct or indirect, it should be his fate to be the cause
of bringing this terrible war to a close, his name will be written
indelibly in the pages of his country's history, even though he should
be described as no more than her accidental saviour.</p></div2>

<p>The two great armies of the North and the South, led respectively
by Grant and Lee, have at last joined in conflict, and tidings of
prolonged slaughter from the seat of war in Virginia arrive by every
mail. From the hasty and necessarily imperfect accounts which have
reached us it is not easy to summarise a precise narrative of
events.</p>
<p>General Grant took the initiative. The order to cross the Rapidan
was given by him early on Tuesday, May 3, and was effected during the
afternoon of that and the whole of the following day without
molestation. Sedgwick commanded the left wing, Hancock the right,
Warren the centre, and Burnside took the reserve. Each division was
computed to be about 30,000 strong. On Thursday morning, May 5, the
whole army, with its supply-trains, which had got safely across the
river on Wednesday night, moved forward. They had hardly got into
motion when it became known that Lee's army was advancing upon
them. The right wing and centre were in line by eleven o'clock, the
left had turned from its original line of march and was ordered to
takes a cross road to complete the formation of the line of
battle. Meanwhile a detachment was pushed forward from the centre to
ascertain Lee's position and strength. They came upon the enemy after
advancing about a mile and a half, and found him in unexpected force,
and were driven hack upon the main body with severe loss. It was then
that General Lee discerned the weak point in the Federal line, and at
once attempted to cut off Hancock, who had not had time to form. To
relieve him from the peril in which he was placed, Sedgwick was
ordered forward to attack, and the completion of the line of battle
was accomplished by Hancock under a terrific fire of musketry. The
dense underground of the country prevented the employment of
artillery. The Federals lost about 1000 men that day; but Grant had
prevented Lee from crushing him before he had had time to mass his men
after the passage of the Rapidan. On the following day (Friday, May 6)
the struggle was resumed by an attack made upon the Federal right wing
by the Confederates under the command of General Ewell. It was repulsed,
and immediately the left was assailed by Longstreet. This attack was
also repulsed, after two hours' hard fight. The right was once more
assailed by more formidable numbers, but a second time Ewell was
driven back to his second line. From noon to five o'clock there was a
succession of fierce assaults, but without any permanent change in the
positions held by the combatants respectively. The day was excessively
hot, and the men were exhausted. About half-past five Longstreet, with
troops newly arrived from Orange Courthouse, and Hill's corps, made a
fierce rush upon the Federal left, forced it back, and threw Mott's
division into confusion. The left centre was compelled by this
movement to give way. There was danger of a break. but General Hancock
ordered Colonel Carroll's brigade to form at right angles with his own
line, and to sweep along the whole front of it, and so take the
assailants in flank. The movement was executed with complete success,
and the Confederates repulsed with terrible slaughter. The battle was
not yet over. After sunset the Confederates made a new and fiercer
attack. It was this time against Sedgwick. On his extreme right lay a
part of his division under General Seymour, and they were at work
intrenching themselves when the enemy fell upon them. The main line
stood firm, but this division of it gave way. Sedgwick's flank was
turned in less than ten minutes; and Seymour's brigade,
panic-stricken, fled a mile and a half through the wood to a plank
road in their rear. Sedgwick, however, retrieved the honour of his
corps and maintained his position to the close. The last blow seemed
designed only to cover Lee's retreat, which he effected, in good
order, during the night. General Grant pushed forward in pursuit and
found his antagonist strongly posted at Spottsylvania Courthouse, on
the River Po; and after heavy skirmishing on Sunday, May 8, he
attacked his enemy along his whole line on Tuesday, the 10th, the
telegrams say, with no decisive result. That Lee severely suffered
there can be no doubt. Longstreet is severely wounded, Pegram badly
so, and Jenkins is killed. On the other hand, Sedgwick and Wadsworth
are<pb n="511"/> killed. The losses of officers and men on both sides
must have been frightful if there be an approximation to the truth in
the estimate which the Federals have given of their own--namely, from
8000 to 10,000 men killed or wounded on the 10th, making an aggregate
of 40,000 soldiers, killed, wounded, or missing during the week's
campaign.</p>


By the City of Washington and the Belgian New

we have news fro York to the evening of the i 4th.

There was no fighting on the 11th inst. but at an early hour onthe

morning of Thursday, the 12±, General Hancock's corps, which had

iiirtea its position in the Federal lure during the night, vigorously attacked the right of the Confederate army, partly turned its flank, carried a line of rifle-pits, and captured 3000 or 4000 prisoners, in*luding two Generals, and twenty-five or thirty guns some of which bowever, are said to have been afterwards abandone!1 or recaptured. A furious battle ensued along the whole front, and lasted until

ightfall; but General Grant made no further impression on General

lee's line, the Confederates retaining their positions before Spoltsylvania Courthouse. During the night General Lee withdrew his forms across the River PO, leaving a line of skirmishers in front of general Grant, who, on the morning of the 13th inst., pushed forward two divisions to ascertain whether his adversary had retreated.

At the date of the latest New York advices it was supposed that

General Lee had occupied, or intended to occupy, a strong position on the North and South Anna Riven. The Federal cavalry had destroyed several miles of railway in his rear on the 9th or 10th inst. There is a report that Siegel has cut the Virginia Central Railway between Charlottesville and Lynchburg, and another report that he has been attacked and defeated by the Confederates under Brackenridge. General Grant, to whom the Federal Cabinet was sending reinforcements, was represented to be continuing his advance in pursuit of the Confederates with as much speed as was permitted by the state of the roads, which had been rendered difficult by a heavy fall of rain during the battle 'of the 12± inst. No esliniate was given of the numbers of slain and wounded during the 12th inst.; but we are told that the slaughter was awful, the men on both sides falling like grain.

 Accounts from other scenes of action are interesting, but for the

most part so incomplete, and so far dwarfed by the absorbing intorest of the central contest, as not to invite comment. General Butler had pushed forward to some extent the auxiliary operations intrusted to him on the south bank of the James River, and claimed to have gained some successes. Nothing having been. heard from him for some days, a shade of misgiving was naturally beginning to fall over the hopes of those who believed him likely to render any important aid towards the common object of taking Richmond.

The campaign on the confines of Tennessee and Georgia had been

actively recommenced, with the result, as far as it is known, of

leading to the discovery that the Confederate position at Resaca was

too strong to be attacked. Forrest, who massacred the negroes at Port Pillow, has been defeated at Bolivar, Tennessee, and driven into Mississippi.

From Louisiana the news is more and more disastrous for the Paderals. General Banks's retreat from Alexandria by the Red River was cut off by Confederate batteries, and the unfortunate Gener.l was endeavouring to reach Brashear City. A fleet of steamers, with supplies and reinforcements for him, had been sunk or captured; and Admiral Porter's gun-boats above the falls of the Red River were stranded by a diversion of the waters, and were sure to fall into the bands of the Confederates.

The Governor of Kentucky has issued a call for 10,000 troops, to serve for six mouths, to come to the rescue of the country, finish the war and save the Government.

The House of Representatives has adopted a resolution to drop

from the army-rolls all unemployed General officers, including

Generals M'Clellan and Fremont. It has also passed the bill giving

to soldiers and sailors, both white and coloured, homesteads from confiscated Confederate estates.

Major-General M'Dowell has been appointed to the command of Ihe military department of the Pacific, and was to leave for California immediately. This step was supposed to have been taken in view of the possibility of a rupture with France on the Mexican question.

The latest quotation of gold at New York on the 14th inst. was

72 per cent premium.

The Richmond Examiner of the 2nd reports the death, occasioned

by a fall, of Joseph B. Davis, aged four years, second son of the Confederate President.

But as regards the three courses which we have indicated,

it is very doubtful which the House of Commons will choose. The Lords will have a good debate or two, but can do little legialatorial work unless it please the other House to supply the material to work upon. The Commons have the matter in their own hands. Up to the present time they have shown no very strong inclination to injure their health by late hours at Westminster, though we are unaware that society, which keeps even later than Parliamentary hours, has been deprived of the advantage and ornament to be derived from the presence of an able-bodied Legislature. We perceive that a judicious excuse for the brief sittings and the frequent countsout is being insinuated with much friendly dexterity. It is stated that we all feel so disturbed by the tdrrible scenes which are enacting in America that it is impossible for the deliberative body to do its duty. Now, we own. that if the business of the journalist were only to provide ideas which the historian might, sometime later, put into graceful and didactic form, this statement would be a valuable contribution to his pages. It will be edifying to read, as our grandchildren will, read, that "towards the middle of the reign of the good Queen Victoria, a fearful civil war broke out in the United States, and that the fratricidal contest was marked by such appalling features that they spread agitation among all classes in Great Britain; and that even the legislature, usually as calm as the Roman senators when the Gauls stormed the Eternal City, was compelled to suspend its duties until such horrors should be terminated." The sentence will be effective for the general reader, and useful as an exercise in dictation at female seminaries, But we who live in the times-which are to be thus credited with sentiment; are unfortunately aware that nothing of the kind is the ease. We have seen times o war, when the Legislature and the public were alike deeply agitated, when the necessary duties of the former were performed with rapidity and with gravity, and when the public and private pleasures of the latter were discontinued, to the honour of all. These were the days when. the flower of our youth and manhood was being wasted in a glorious but ill-conducted war, and when we were hearing how a bad system was wounding us far worse than the Russian. sword could do. At that time such an excuse was indeed valid. Bat now, it would be cant to say that the public mind of London is much more impressed by the American war than the public mind of New York. We write deliberately, for
we do approach a terrible subject with becoming reree

whereas the American press appears to take a pti

en though the cannon can almost be heard in

and. the very last of the file of papers that hare read

us contains a few flippant leading paragraphs on the war, aa

in equally large type, a long and elaborate article upon the

management of the Opera-home. At least, we write aatuy t the carnage among those who are our kinsmen and who speak our language. But to say that the American war is thstuthin us, and making it impossible for the Legislature to do its day* is one of those fictions that would be pleasant if p1eamr had a right to mix itself up with such a topic.
THE CONFEDERATE ST5ArER GEORGIA.

We engrave, from a drawing by Mr. Frank Wilson, of Birkenhead, the steamer Georgia, in the naval service of the Confederate States of America, now lying in the Great Float at Birkenhead. This is the vessel which formed the subject of a debate in the Rouse of Commons on Friday, the 18th inst., when Mr. Thomas Baring contended that the British ports ought to be shut against her, because she had been originally equipped and sent forth from a British port in violation of the laws of this neutral State. It appears that the Georgia, which was formerly called the Japan, was built a year or two since at Dumbarton, on the Clyde. She was equipped by a Liverpool firm. fler crew was shipped by the same Liverpool firm for Shanghai, and sent ipund to Greenock by steamer. She was entered, on. the 81st of March, 1863, as for Point de Galle and Hong-Kong, with a crew of forty-eight men. She left her anchorage on the morning of the 2nd of April in that year, ostensibly to try her engines, but did not return. She had no armament on leaving Greenock, but a few days after her departure a small steamer called the Allar, freighted with guns, shot, and shell, and having on board a partner of the Liverpool firm who had equipped her and shipped her crew, left Newhaven and met the Georgia o the coast of France, near Ushsnt. The cargo of the Allar was successfully transferred to the Georgia on the 8th or 9th of April; her crew consisted of British subjects. The Georgia was registered as the property of a Liverpool merchant, a partner of the firm which shipped the crew, and she remained the property of this gentleman until the 23rd of June, when the register was cancelled, he notifying to the collector her sale to foreign owners. From the very first, however, the Georgia has been carrying on war against the United States, cruising in the Atlantic and burning a number of vessels. Her crew have now been paid o

in. Liverpool without any conceal

ment, and the vessel is now laid up.
A. correspondence between Lord R. Cecil and Mr. T. BarIq has been published, in consequence of the former having in a

The narrative of the slaughter of the Federal troops in Grant's last

advance has driven some leader writers into hysterics. Never was

such slaughter, they cry; we cannot match it in the battles of the old world. Indeed I can we not? In five days the Federals have, it appears, lost 40,000 men killed, wounded, and skedaddied; this is about 8000 a day, a dreadful number certainly. But at Waterloo the total loss of the allied army in killed, wounded, and missing was 22,976 in one day; at Crecy we slew 30,000 of the French private men and nearly 8000 nobles and knights in one day, and took three crowned kings prisoners; and at Blenheim Marlborough slew 27,000 allies and took 13,000 prisoners; thus in actual loss to his enemy ,equalling the fight of- five days in America. It is just as well to recall these facts, for some people are inflated even by the magnitude of their misfortunes just as a bankrupt rejoices when he breaks for forty thousand, and looks down with contempt upon. the struggling wretch who stops payment just for the want of a few hundreds.
G!N1tAL R. E. LEE, COMMANDEfl.-IN-CHIEF OF T1 i

ARMY OF THE CONPEDE11ATB SOUTHERN STATES.

THE Engraving on our front page is a faithful likeness of one of the greatest soldiers of this age. Three years' campaigns, in defence of his native State of Virginia-undertaken, doubtless, from motives of patriotism-have shown his consummate mastery of the art of war, which he had learned as an officer in the service of the formerly United States. General Lee has proved himself to possess, in high perfection, that peculiar combination of moral and intellectual qualities which fits a man for military command. Since the fighting dave of Wellington and Napoleon there has been no more signal example of ability for the direction and control of a large army, whether scat red over a wide extent of territory or massed together with a view to bear upon a single point. Even his opponents, who would not have deemed it creditable to themselves to underrate the genius which has so long held them in check on the road from Washington to Richmond, have owned his superiority to all the saccossive generals of the Federal army. The biography of this eminent man will be written when his figure shall have emerged from the bewildering conflict of the civil war. His personal and professional merits will then be justly appreciated. In the meantime, we have only to note a few of the dates in his career.

 Robert Edmund Lee was born, in 1808, of am old English family which had been settled in Virginia for many generations bsfore the American colonies separated themselves from their allegiance to Great Britain. He is a gentleman by birth, breeding, and social Bosition. Re is a large landed proprietor; being the owner of Wbitehouees, an estate formerly belonging to Washington, which is situated upon Arlington Heights, on the Virginia shore of the Potomac, overlooking the city of Washington, which takes its naino from that hero. Lee was regularly educated for the profession of arms in the United States Military Academy at West Point. Es servl with the Engineer Corps in the Mexican campaign. At the battle of Chapultepec he was severely wounded, and was twice promoted for conspicuous gallantry during that war; though it was considered that neither Lee nor Beauregard, who also ¡behavcd with great distinction in Maxico, obtaine as much notice as they deserved in the despatches of General Scott. In 1852 Major Lee was appointed Superintendent of the Military Academy; but three years after verde he was sent to Europe in company with MCClellan, then a Captain, as American military commissioners to study the proceedings of the French and English armies in the siege of Sebastopol. Oa ti-At occasion Lee was advanced to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the 2nd Regiment of Cavalry, and this was his position at the beginning of 1861, when the war of secession broke out. Re was at San Antonio, in Texas, commanding his own regiment, when he heard that the State of Virginia, which he regards as his proper country, had withdrawn from the Federal Union, and that the Northern States were going to make war upon the South, to force them to return to ther allegiance. Colonel Lee felt it was his duty, under these circumstances, to be a soldier of Virginia, said no longer a servant of the Federal Government, in which Virginia had now no part. He raised a small body of militia in his own neighbo'arhood to occupy Arlington heights, but was ordered by the Confederate Government to fall back on Fairfax Courthouse, while Beauregard was preparing to meet the first onsot of the enemy at Manaseas and Bull Run.

 President JeffersonDavis, however, soon discerned in Lee the man whom this emergency required, and called him to a higher post. He was appointed General and Commander of the Forces in Virginia; and, takinc' up the remnant of Garnett's corps, which had been shattered by lr1Clel1an at Rich Mountain, he soon cleared the north-west counties of the enemy's presence. Alter performing this service he took charge of the 'dinestry of War at Richmond, and applied himself to the immense preparations that were necessary for the

Paigil of 1862. In planning that campaign it was General

Lee's opinion, contrary to the judgment of Beaurejard, that the best lines for the defences of Richmond were-firstly, that of the Rappahannook; and, secondly, that of the Rapidan; whereas Beauregard would have drawn them farther north, at Manassas Gap and Bull Run. That General Lee was in the right has been proved by the campaigns of 1863 and 1861. The strip of country between the Rapidan and Richmond, being hilly and thickly wooded, gave him peculiar facilities for constructing those fortified positions on which his skill as a military engineer, in the intervals of active campaigning has been constantly employed. It wllbaremsinbared that General k'CleUan, his worthy antagonist in 1862, was so convinced of the impregnability of these lines, guarding the dirort road by Fredericksburg to the Confederate capital, that besought to turn them by transporting his army down (ihesaoeake Bay to the Peninsula below Richmond, and landing on the banks of the James River. But the Federal army, wasted by a series of fiercelyfought battles and by the diseases of an unhealtiy climate at midsummer, was compelled to abandon the prize which then seemed almost within its green. It was a that period, when General Joseph Johnston was disabled in the battle of Seven Pines, that Genera Lee succeeded to the supreme command
of the Confederate armies in the field. Promptly taking ad yan of the weak position of M'CIeUan who lay too loosely on both ba ~of the Chicaahoniiny, separated from M'Dowell and his o supports, Lee sallied out of Richmond and attacked him with SWA pertinacious energy that, in seven days' continuous fighting, t Federals were driven to their ships. The subsequent moremn j, the Upper Potomac and the whole campaign of 1863 were condnj on a very different principle. So long as General Lee stood on t defensive in the neighbourhood of Fredericksburg he could secure hi chosen line of the Rappahannock against all the attempts of Bti and Hooker to make their way south. But whea, having des Hooker at Ohancelloravifle, he ventured beyond the dnfen Virginia, and invaded the territory of Maryland, necessarily losing much time by a circuitous road to i'he west, General Lee was not so successful. The checks which General M'Clellan at Antietan Creek, and General Meade at Ge9aburg, administered to the (Jonfr. army had more effect, probably, than any other incidents of this war in defining the relative capabilities of the two hostile forces. It see,ej to be as difficult for the South to approach Baltimore and Washington as for the North to conquer Richmond. The remainder of last yeawas chiefly emdoyed by General Lee in controlling and suecon the army of .j.ennesSee; while taking measures, no doubt, for a. renewal of the contest in Virginia, which we have j nab seen recinenced with so much greater fury.

 The stirring news of this day will afford the best commentary upon the plans and exploits of General Lee in the service of the (Jonfp. States, of which he is the ablest and most accomplished defenderthough Stonewall Jackson, Longatreet, and Joseph Johnston ma have equalled, or even excelled, him in some particular quilitles of the soldier. General Lee is still in the prime and vigou.r of manhood. He is six feet in height, erect, well formed, and of imposing appearance, has clear, bright, benignant black eyes, dark grey hair, and a heavy grey beard. He is exceedingly plain in his dress, and yea look at his costume in vain for the insignia of rank. He wears an unassuming black felt hat, with a narrow strip of gold lace around it, and a plain Brigadier's coat with three stars on the collar, but without the usual braiding on the sleeves. He travels and sleeps in an ambe. lance when the army is in motion, and occupies a tent when it is stationary, and not the largest and best house in the neighbourhood, as is the custom of some officers. He cares but little for aDpearancea, and is content to take the same fare his soldiers receive, in characte and personal deportment he is ardent, grave, and dignified, yet modest and even distrustful of his own abilities. The descendant of a gallant officer of the elder revolution, the husband of the grand-daughter (by adoption) of General Washington, the inheritor of a large estate, and the trusted leader of a great and victorious army, he is nevertheless accessible to the humblest and most rugged soldier in the ranks, courteous to his officers, just and kind to all. During the time the array was in Maryland, an officer of high position suggested a numb of reasons to General Lee in support of a grave measure then under discussion. Among others, he remarked to him that he was trusted by his Government, had the hearts of his soldiers, and possessed the entire confidence of his country, and that they relied implicitly upon his patriotism and genius. Tears rushed to his eTes, and be exclaimed, "Do not say that-do not say that, I am sens:ble of my weakness, and such a responsibility as your remark implies would crush me to the earth." He said, in the same conversation, that there 'was nothing he so much desired as peace and independence. AU he had, and all he hoped for-all that ambition could suggest or glory give-he would freely surrender to stop the flow' of blood and secure freedom to the country. He did not doubt that these blessings would come in due season; but he wanted them now, and

would readily sacrifice every thon,ht of personal aggrandisement to.

save the life of even one soldier.

The admirable photograph from which our Engraving has been made is one taken by Messrs. Min.nis and Co well, of Richmond, which beam the stamp of its legal registration in 1863, "in the District Court of the Confederate States for the Eastern District of Virginia."
AhiRICA.

We have information from New York to the afternoon of the 21st nit. Preceding accounts informed us that on the morning of the lath General Lee had retreated from the scene of battle of the 12th as

pottaylvania, and that General Grautwas inhot pursuit. This report we were enabled to contradict in a portion of our Imprsjon laat week. Lee still holds a strong position north of the Spottaylvania Courthouse, and the two armies are confronting each other. No

ghtIng occurred for several days after the 12th, in consequence, it is sited, of heavy rains. An impression has gained ground that Grant's Issass were greater, and the condition of his array less favourable, than was previously supposed. Secretary Stanton announced on the morning of the 18th ult. that, according to General Grant's latest reports, the condition of the roads had improved, and that the Federal Commander-in-Chief, who was receiving large reinforcements, designed moving against the enemy without delay. Facts bore oat this ertion, for at daybreak on Wednesday, the 18th, Grant again assuccessfn]ly assaulted Lee's centre and left. After a desperate eotf.lct, lasting throughout the forenoon, the Federals were forced to retreat, with loss of 1200 killed and wounded. An attack by Lee is stated to have been subsequently made upon Grant's front, and repulsed. On Thursday evening, the 10th, Ewdll gained Grant's rear and attempted the capture of the Federal supply-trains. After an hcfs fighting, in which the Federals lost upwards of 1000 men, the Cunfederates returned to their intrenchments, leaving 300 prisoners in the bands of the Federals. General Lee has, it is said, been reinforced from North Carolina and Mississippi.

 Reverses have befallen the Federal corps operating against Lee's left flank and rear. Butler has been attacked at Drury's Bluff in front and rear, and compelled to retire within his lines. The Confederates Captured General Hickman, with nearly his whole brigade and eight or taxi cannon, and drove the whole Federal force to their intrenchmeats at Bermuda. The Federal loss in killed and wounded is admitted to be 2500. General Ransom commanded the Confederates. General Beauregard is in General Butler's immediate front, preparing to assault his intrenchmenta. Siegel has been defeated at Newmarket and forced to retreat across the Shenandoah with the loss of five guns and 650 men. General Sheridan's cavalry has, however, mixed round Lee's rear, and joined Butler on the Peninsula. He destroyed the railroad at Beaver Darn, Ashland, and had a sbar engagement with General Stuart. He marched between the neat and second lines of the Richmond defences, but, finding them too strong for assault, retreated across the Chickahonuny to Bottom's Bridge. Richmond papers announce that General J, B. B. Stuart has been kiUed and that Lou "street's "and is not mortal. According to Southern accounts the arnage done to Lee's bras of communication had been repaired.

The chief interest of the war still centres in Virginia. We have intelligence from Lee and Grant to the 26th nit. There has been no general engagement since our last report, but the position has shifted about twelve miles southward. This much we can perceive through telegraphic haziness, but the reasons for the movement are not so clear. According to one view, General Grant, finding hard fighting of no avail to chive back his opponent, strove to turn his flank. He pushed for ward his left, under Hancock, in a south-easterly direction to Bowlinggreen, attempting thus to pass to the right, and get in the rear of the Confederate army. In this movement, however, he was at once followed by the Confederates, under Longetreeb and Ewell; and the whole body of the Confederate army, leaving Spottsylvania, retired southward, keeping pace with the Federal advance. Another view of the movements, however, is, that General Lee, in pursuance of a settled plan of drawing the Federals on and wasting their energies, purposely and deliberately retreated from SpottsyLvania, and that Grant's advance upon Bowling-green was a consequence, not the cause, of Lee's backward movement. Dazing these changes of position thhre was continual skirmishing, and the Federals claim to have taken 1000 prisoners. Despatches from General Grant up to the morning of May 26 state "that his movement was progressing, and the result would be manifest in twenty-four hours." General Lee's position covers Sexton's Junction, his right resting on Little Swamp, and his left on Little River. The Federals have abandoned their depOt at Fredericksburg and Acquia Creek, and have established notherneaxer to General Grant. Sexton's Junction is about twenty-five miles from Richmond; and, to give a notion of the importance of the post to Lee, it is only necessary to state that a railway from the north and one from the west intersect at this point, running hence in nearly parallel lines to Richmond. It was rnniourecl in New York on the 28th-such rumours, however, are of little worth-that General Grant intended marching towards the peninsula, between the James and York rivers, to try M'Clellan's programme, or, possibly, to effect a junction with Butler. The rest of the news is soon told. Butler is besieged and. furiously assaulted in his intrenchmeuts; Banks has struggled back to New Orleans; and Sherman is advancing, but without being able to come up to his adversary in Georgia. The Confederate guerrilla leader Mosby had been enabled, in consequence of the withdrawal of the Federal outposts into Washington, to destroy all the bridges and blockhouses on the railway from Union. Mills to the Rapidan. The ironclad attack upon the forts in Charleston Harbour on the 15th nit, was without result.

The Confederate Congress had refused to consider resolutions proposing that an armistice of ninety days should be obtained, with a view to the conclusion of a peace.

The Marquis of CrANnXC&IIDE moved that an humble address be presented'

to her Majesty for copies of extracts from any despatches from her Majesty's

Minister at Washington relating to the proceedings or report of the Select

Committee of the United States Congress on immigration, or to bills upon

the subject brought into Congress; and also for copies of extracts from

despatches or reports respecting the enlistment of Irish immigrants a

Boston and Portland in the month of March last, or to the enlistment

of any of her Majesty's Canadian subjects in the United States army.

The noble Marquis said that for the last two years the Federal Government

had displayed a deliberate intention of recruiting its army from foreigners,

and especially from the subjects of her Majesty. He complained that

while we had permitted the Federals to obtain arms and the munitions of war from this country without question, we had put the Foreiga Enlistment Act in force the moment the Confederates evinced a desire to, obtain ships of war from the same source. He was thlorme.i that at the present moment there was a regular diplt in this country for the enlistment of Germans for the service of the United States. He urged that, although such proceedings were not openly carried on, they were proceedings which the Foreign Enlistment Act was intended to prevent, and he thought stops should be taken by the Government to put the provisions of that Act into operation. He- wished the Government to make vigorous remonstrances, and if those remonstranoes were not attended to, than he should like to know if that would not be a case for war if ever there was one. While protesting against the proceedings resorted to on behalf of the Federals, he expressed a hope that such an alteration would soon take place in the position of the contending parties as would enable the European Powers to interpose with a prospect of putting an end to the terrible carnage now going on.

Lord BROUGHAM seconded the motion. He said the Federal Giveromant

were now inveigling poor Irish immigrants into the commission of a breach of our neutrality, which would subject them in this country to punishment as criminals. He reminded the House that in our war with America the loudest complaints were made by the colonists of the emplo7msnt of Hessian and other German troops in subduing them. He deeply deplored that his old friends in America, in whose cause he had sustained so much abuse in bygone sears, had allowed themselves to be drawn into so sanguinary and unchristian a war, and he sincerely hoped that peace would soon be restored.

Earl R'SSELL assented to the production of the papers moved for by the noble Marquis, but said bethought it would have been better to have waited until the papers were produced, in order to ascertain if his or Lord Lyons's conduct was open to censure. Lord Lyons had repeatedly remonstrated with the Federal Government, and he (Earl Russell) had done all in his power to second the remoustrsrtces of his noble friend. With regard to the sale of arms and munitions of 'war to the Northern States, there was no law' which prevented it, but all articles thus exported were liable to capture on the part of the Confederates. The fitting out of ships of war for a belligerent Power was upon a very different footing, and was a direct breach of the Foreign Enlistment Act. He denied that the Government were at all blamable for the steps which had taken place in Ireland for I uliioln the people of that country to emigrate to America. He believed that the Irish peasantry had been led away by their own credulity, and that they had, no one
