<p>The great battle of Fredericksburg, in which the Federal armies
sustained a disastrous repulse, is described in the Supplement, page
18.</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th the army of the Potomac was withdrawn to
the north side of the Rappahannock, "because," reports General
Burnside "I felt fully convinced that the position in front could not
be carried, and it was a military necessity either to attack the enemy
or retire." This perilous movement was effected during a stormy night,
and was not discovered by the Confederates until it was too late to
interrupt it. The wounded were all saved, and the pontoon bridges
removed.</p>

<p>The Confederates have advanced their pickets in Fredericksburg to
points near to the banks of the Rappahannock, have increased their
intrenchments in the rear of the city, and thrown up rifle-pits on the
left of the city near the river.</p>

<p>Official reports of the Northern losses put their casualties at
1400 killed, and 8000 wounded, to which may be added 800 taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Confederate commander General Lee has drawn up his report of
the engagement. He acknowledges a loss of 1800 in killed and
wounded. Among the former he names Generals Cobb and Gregg.</p>

<p>The Federal Senate has ordered inquiry to be made into the facts of
the Fredericksburg disaster.</p>

<p>There have been some movements in North Carolina. The Confederate
General Evans had telegraphed that the Federal General attacked
Kingston, on the 13th, with 15,000 men and nine gun-boats. The fight
lasted ten hours and the Federals were driven back to their
gun-boats. The Northern accounts admit that they lost 500 prisoners
and eleven pieces of artillery. The Southerners were eventually
compelled to retire from the town, the Federal bombardment having
greatly injured it.</p>

<p>The Confederates have made a demonstration against Harper's Ferry, but were repulsed.</p>
<p>Five disabled vessels of Banks's expedition have put into Port Royal.</p>
<p>The Confederates have sunk the Federal gun-boat Cairo with torpedoes
off Yazoo River.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand men have deserted from the army of the Potomac, and the
number is every day increasing.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">New Orleans.</hi></p>

<p>General Butler has issued an order that no person be allowed to
land from any vessel arriving at New Orleans without taking the oath
of allegiance. General Butler had ordered a further assessment of the
cotton-brokers for the support of the poor.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>
<p>The New York journals simultaneously report that Mr. Seward has
resigned, in consequence of a vote of want of confidence in the
Cabinet passed by a caucus of Republican senators.</p>

<p>Attorney-General Bates has given an opinion in opposition to the
Dred Scott decision, and to the effect that coloured men are citizens
of the United States. The case arose from the detention at Perth
Amboy, by a revenue cutter, of a schooner commanded by a coloured man,
who, if not a citizen of the United States, would have been
incompetent to act as her captain. The Attorney-General decides that
all free persons, without distinction of race and colour, if native
born, are citizens. The question of citizenship is distinct from that
of political rights. A child or a woman is a citizen, though not
privileged to vote or take office. The opinions in the Dred Scott case
are pronounced to be of no more authority than the <hi
rend="italic">obiter dicta</hi>hi> of eminent lawyers as the question
before the Supreme Court in that case only involve1 the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court. The master of the schooner is pronounced to be
legally competent to command the vessel, and the embargo laid on her
is ordered to be quashed.</p>

<p>The popular feeling runs high in the North against General Halleck
and Secretary Stanton, to whom the late reverse of the Federal arms is
attributed.</p>

<p>Mr. Rarey, the horsetamer, has been appointed Commissioner of
Horses in the Federal States. His first official act was to go to the
army of the Potomac under Burnside. There he inquired fully into the
health of the horses, and has adopted a new system to check the
mortality among them.</p>

<p>The British Consul at Fredericksburg was arrested by the Federals
on the 11th, on suspicion of being a rebel spy, but was in a short time
released. On the 12th, at the request of General Howard, he was again
arrested, on the charge that he had secreted armed rebels in his
house and then aided them in their escape.</p>

<p>The commercial intelligence states that Congress and the leading
bankers are agreed in the condemnation of Mr. Chase's plan for the
reconstitution of the banks of the country. Gold remains nearly
stationary at about 32 per cent premium.</p></div2>

<p>Advices from Philadelphia state that the fibre of the plant
hibiscos moscheutos is occupying the attention of the merchants at
that port as a substitute for linen rags and jute. This plant is
indigenous to the Northern States, and grows in abundance in the
swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, &amp;c. At a moderate
calculation, and taking into account the probability of loss from
unforeseen causes, three tons and a half of disentegrated fibre can be
derived from one acre of ground. Two prominent paper manufacturers of
New York have estimated the fibre to be worth 100 dollars per ton, to
be used as a substitute for linen rags in the manufacture of paper.--

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> appears to contain the
best account of the great battle which took place at Fredericksburg
on the 13th of December. The account is dated Fredericksburg, 13th
of December. We give copious extracts:--</p>

<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Theatre Of
Operations.</hi></p>
<p>The theatre of operations to-day extended from Fredericksburg on
the right and down the south side of the Rappahannock for two
miles. Immediately behind the town of Fredericksburg the land forms a
plateau or smooth field, running back for about a third of a mile. It
then rises for forty or fifty yards, forming a ridge of ground which
runs along to the left for about a quarter of a mile, where it abuts
at Hazel Dell, a ravine formed by the Hazel River, which empties into
the Rappahannock west of the town. At the foot of the ridge runs the
telegraph road, flanked by a stone wall. This eminence was studded
with rebel batteries. To the right, along and up the river, the ridge
prolongs itself to opposite Falmouth, and beyond; and here, too,
batteries were placed on every advantageous position. Back of the
first ridge so another plateau and then a second terrace of wooded
hills, where a second line of fortifications was placed. Between the
rear of the town and the first ridge of hills was the theatre of
operations of the right grand division of the Army under General
Summer.</p>

<p>A word now on the scene of operations of the left grand
division. From the lower part of the town the ridge on which it is
built slopes abruptly down to a comparatively level or undulating
country, which stretches for some miles down the Rappahannock. About a
couple of miles back of the river it rises into a wooded slope. At a
point a mile and a half below Fredericksburg two pontoons had been
thrown across on Thursday morning, and on Friday the whole of the left
grand division, under the command of Major-General Franklin, had
marched over the river. Daylight on Saturday found the force drawn up
in battle array on this broad plain skirting the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>The battle-ground, though very marshy in some places, presented a
fine field for military evolutions. The turnpike leading to
Fredericksburg runs about half a mile from, and nearly parallel to,
the river. Beyond is the railroad, and, still further beyond, the
wooded range of hills in which the enemy were strongly
intrenched. About a mile and a half from Fredericksburg, nearly on the
river edge, is situated A. N. Barnord's stone mansion, after the
English style.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Disposition Of The
Troops.</hi></p>
<p>The line of battle, as it appeared in the morning, was as
follows:--The 6th Army Corps, under General Smith (Franklin's old
force), on the right, composed of three divisions. The 1st Army Corps
(General Reynolds's) extending still further to the left, drawn up in
the following order:--General Gibbons's division on the right,
connecting with General Howe's, General Meade's centre, and General
Doubleday left, fronting to the southward and resting nearly on the
river. This constituted the order in which our forces were drawn up,
there being three distinct lines of battle.</p>

<p>Opposed to our right, under General Sumner, was the rebel left,
under command of General Longstreet. Opposed to our left, under
General Franklin, was the rebel right, under General Jackson. General
Lee, Generalissimo of the Southern army, was in person in command of
the Confederate forces during the whole day.</p>

<p>The plan of General Burnside, agreed upon in council of war, was to
endeavour to pierce the rebel centre. Early on the morning of Saturday
the order was given that Sumner's left, composed of the 9th Army
Corps, under command of General Willcox, should be extended until it
reached Franklin's right--thus forming a continuous line of battle
along the river for two miles, the left resting on the river at the
point where the lower pontoons cross, and the right on
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>The left wing, comprising the whole of Franklin's command (50,000
men), should then be swung round as on a pivot, formed by Sumner's
extreme right, resting on Fredericksburg. If successful in this
man&#x0153;uvre, Franklin would divide the rebel line, taking possession of
the railroad (the line of retreat), and come in on the flank of the
rebel works back of Fredericksburg. While this movement was being
developed, a division was to be sent up from General Sumner's command
by the plank read to storm the ridge. If there should be any failure
in this, it was hoped that the co-operation of Franklin would
presently make success certain. Hooker's corps was designed to act as
a reserve.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Beginning Of The
Battle.</hi></p>

<p>The dawn of Saturday found the forces distributed as thus
indicated. It was a fine Virginia morning, mild and balmy as a
September day, though the mist and fog of a late Indian summer hung
over the field of battle.</p>

<p>It was with alarm and pain I found a general want of confidence and
gloomy foreboding among some men whose sound judgment I had learned to
trust. The plan of attacking the rebel stronghold directly in front
would, it was feared, prove a most hazardous enterprise, and one of
which there is no successful example in military history. It was
doubted that the co-operation of the right and left, according to the
programme, would admit of practical execution, and things were
generally at loose ends.</p>

<p>About half-past eleven o'clock I crossed the Rappahannock on the
upper pontoon-bridge, and passed through the town of Fredericksburg
along the main street. At this time brisk skirmishing was going on in
the outskirts of the town, the rebel sharpshooters stubbornly
contesting every inch of the ground as our skirmishers
advanced. Caroline or Maine street was occupied by General Kimball's,
General Ferrero's, and Acting-General Zook's brigade, with portions of
Hancock's division. The latter, with his artillery, lined the bank of
the river in the neighborhood of the middle crossing, which is just
below the railroad bridge. Other troops from the corps of Generals
Willcox and Couch occupied the other streets of the town nearer the
line of advance. Our batteries replied across the river, covering the
advance of our forces. In the meantime, Franklin had been for a couple
of hours briskly engaged with the enemy on the left. The force in
Fredericksburg had driven the rebels out of the suburbs of the town
and rested their column on the canal. The time had now come to attempt
an advance on the rebel position. The orders were to move rapidly,
charge up the hill, and take the batteries at the point of the
bayonet. Orders easy to give, but, ah! how hard of execution! Look at
the position to be stormed! There is a bare plateau of a third of a
mile which the storming party will have to cross. In doing so they
will be exposed to the fire, first, of the enemy's sharpshooters,
posted behind a stone wall running along the base of the ridge; of a
double row of rifle-pits on the rim of the crest, of the heavy
batteries behind strong fieldworks that stud the top of the hill, of
a powerful infantry force now lying concealed behind these, of a
plunging fire from the batteries on the lower range, of a double
enfilading fire from "cannon to right of them, cannon to left of
them." Sebastopol was not half as strong.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Central Advance.</hi></p>

<p>The line of battle was formed by Conch's corps (the 2nd), composed
of the divisions of French, Hancock, and Howard, the left of the line
abutting on Sturgis' division of Willcox's corps (the 9th). The first
advanced was French's, composed of the brigades of Kimball, Morris, and
Weber, supported by Hancock's division, consisting of the brigades of
Caldwell, Zook, and Meagher. Forming his men under cover of a small
knoll in the rear of the town, skirmishers were deployed to the left
towards Hazel Dell; Sturgis, supporting at the same time, moved up and
rested on a point on the railroad.</p>

<p>The moment they exposed themselves on the railroad forth bursts the
deadly hail. From the rifle-pits came the murderously-aimed missiles;
from the batteries, tier above tier, on the terraces, shot planes of
fire; from the enfilading cannon, distributed on the arcs of a circle
two miles in extent, came cross showers of shot and shell. Across the
plain for a while they swept under this fatal fire. They were
literally mowed down. The bursting shells made great gaps in their
ranks; but these are presently filled by the closing up of the
line. For fifteen immortal minutes at least they remain under this
fiery surge. Onward they press, though their ranks grow fearfully
thin. They have passed over a greater part of the interval, and have
almost reached the base of the hill, when brigade after brigade of
rebels rise op on the crest and pour in fresh volleys of musketry at
short range. They fell back, shattered and broken, amid shouts and
yells from the enemy.</p>
<p>General French's division went into the fight
6000 strong; but at night he told me he could count but 1500.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Federal Batteries Fire On
Their Own Men.</hi></p> 

<p>The fire of the rebel batteries was not the only thing from which
our men had to suffer. Thinking to silence the enemy's guns, our
batteries planted on the bluff on the north side of the river
embracing some 4&#x00BD; siege guns, some batteries of 20-pounder Parrotts,
and the artillery of the left and left centre, opened fire. The
intervening space is between 2700 and 3000 yards--too great a distance
to calculate on the projectiles carrying with accuracy, particularly
contractor's ammunition. If shell should short or take an oblique
direction and explode among our troops, it would be difficult to see
how a panic could be prevented. Promptly seeing this danger, General
Hunt, Chief of Artillery, instantly dispatched orders to cease
firing. It was well he did so, for immediately afterwards an
Aide-de-Camp came galloping from General Couch, from the other side of
the river, begging that our batteries should cease, as they were
actually firing into his command.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Battle Continues.</hi></p>

<p>While the broken column retires to its original position in the
outskirts of the town to reform for a new encounter, let us see what
goes on to the left. At daylight the forces comprising the left grand
division of the army appeared, drawn up in battle array on the broad
plain below Fredericksburg, and skirting the Rappahannock. No sooner
had the heavy mist cleared away than Captain Hall's battery (2nd
Maine), planted at the right of Gibbons's division, opened fire upon
the rebels. Artillery fire now became general along the whole line,
which was returned by the rebels. Heavy siege guns in our rear; the
1st Maryland, 1st Massachusetts Batteries, and Battery D, 5th
Artillery, on the right; Captain Ransom's and Captain Walker's in
front: and Cowan's New York, and Lieutenant Hahn's 3rd New York
Independent on the left, and other batteries, kept up a terrific fire
on the rebels. Orders now came to advance, and about nine o'clock
Gibbon's and Meade's divisions commenced moving slowly forward.</p>

<p>The advance resulted in almost straightening our lines, which were
before somewhat of a crescent. Considerable resistance was met with,
yet the forces continued to move forward until, at midday, the line of
battle was three quarters of a mile in advance of where it had been at
the outset. But now came the reserve fire of the enemy with terrific
force.  Shot, shell and canister were poured into our men from various
points, while the rebel infantry appearing, fired with rapidity. Still
they continued to press on. Several batteries moved forward at the
same time. As our troops saw the enemy giving way, cheer after cheer
rent the air.</p>

<p>About one o'clock General Meade ordered a charge, which was well
executed, the men pressing on the edge of the very crest, and
skillfully penetrating, by a movement on the flank, an opening which
happened to occur between the division of A. P. Hill and Early's
brigade, captured several hundred prisoners belonging to the 61st
Georgia and 31st North Carolina.</p>

<p>While the fight was progressing at this point the enemy sent four
heavy columns down on our left, near the river. They were handsomely
repulsed and driven back, however, by General Doubleday's
division. Owing to the lack of reinforcements, General Meade's command
was obliged to fall back a quarter of a mile--three-quarters of a mile
beyond the ground first occupied. Very heavy musketry-firing continued
along the line, neither side gaining any material advantage. About
half-past one o'clock the first line of battle in General Gibbons's
division was relieved by the second, when Tower's brigade, now
commanded by Colonel Root, charged over an open field beyond the
railroad and down into the edge of the woods, occupying the
breastworks which the enemy had constructed there, and capturing 200
prisoners belonging to the 36th North Carolina and a South Carolina
regiment. General Gibbons was severely wounded in the right hand. They
held their own for some time, but were eventually compelled to fall
back. It was while the fight was progressing at this point that
General Bayard was fatally wounded. About two o'clock General Birney's
division of General Hooker's grand division, which had been delayed
for some time in crossing by the enemy's shells, moved forward to the
left to the support of Meade's division. Gibbons's had become much cut
up. The musketry fight was then very heavy, and this division suffered
severely.</p>

<p>Adjoining the first corps under Reynolds were the sixth corps under
General Smith, presenting the following formation, in three lines of
battle:--General Newton at the right, General Burke at the centre, and
General Howe on the left, connecting with Reynold's corps.</p>

<p>At sunrise the skirmishers commenced moving forward, General Vinton
commanding. About eight o'clock the rebels opened a heavy cannonade
upon the men. Some of their batteries were but a short distance
away. A burning dwelling, which attracted considerable attention the
night previous, was destroyed by them in order to make better their
range. Martin's New York Battery, Frank's 1st New York, and Snow's 1st
Maryland replied to the rebel gnus with much spirit. At three o'clock
General Newton's was withdrawn from the extreme of this corps, and
took a position on the extreme right of Reynolds's command, where it
was actively employed during the remainder of the day. About four
o'clock the 4th New Jersey were ordered to charge upon a force of the
enemy near the railroad, which they did, driving them back for one
hundred yards or more. A superior force then appearing against them,
they were forced to retire. Colonel H. B. Hatch fell, wounded in the
leg. The rebels ceased their artillery fire on this position of the
army about ten o'clock in the morning. Toward evening, however, they
sent a full brigade in the direction of Martin's battery, who came on
with a yell, expecting to capture it. The warm reception which they
received from the battery and the 2nd and 4th Vermont Regiments, which
were acting as skirmishers, compelled them to fall back. At the same
time the three lines of infantry, composed of Pratt's and Vinton's
brigades, stood to arms, and advanced with fixed bayonets. Night put
an end to further operations on each side, with the exception of
occasional discharges from our heavy guns.</p>

<p>The result of the day's fighting on the left, so diversified in its
character, was to give the left possession of about five hundred yards
in extent. So far as stubbornly holding its own, and even gaining
ground, the left grand division deserves credit. It had, however,
wholly failed to perform the tactical man&#x0153;uvre assigned to
it.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Condition of the
Right.</hi></p>

<p>Returning to the right I found General Sumner seated on the front
seat of an unyoked ambulance at the Lacey House, directly opposite
Fredericksburg, at the point where the first pontoon bridge spans the
stream. The old man looked anxious and fearful. Things were not going
well with his command. For three hours his men had been fighting at
fearful odds. They were much exhausted, their loss was excessive, and
nothing had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Indeed, to the test of the ear at the point where we were located,
it seemed as though they were being badly pressed. The batteries had
been brought down and planted at the heads of the streets. The troops
were hugging the city closely to escape the fearful fire. "Where is
Franklin?" was the eager inquiry. "Everything depends on Franklin's
coming up on the flank."</p>

<p>Franklin's position was plainly observable by the line of smoke
and fire a couple of miles to our left below. He was coming no
nearer.</p>

<p>At three o'clock an Aide arrives from General Couch to say that his
(Couch's) troops are advancing finely, but that Willcox was not
keeping up. "Tell General Willcox," replies General Sumner, "tell him
he must make the 9th Army Corps keep pace with the 2nd, if he
can."</p>

<p>At half-past three o'clock, Sturgis, who had been clinging to the
valley amid showers of fire, is so hotly pressed that he hardly thinks
he can hold his own till Griffin comes up. At four o'clock French
reports that his right is held by a brigade (Mason's) which is without
ammunition.</p>

<p>Summer sends a message begging Burnside that Franklin be directed
to advance. But Franklin cannot advance. He has enough to do at
this moment to hold his own, for Jackson has just thrown in
reinforcements, and is pushing hard to turn his left. Meantime the
reserves have not been touched. Hooker's central grand division,
50,000 fresh men, have not yet been engaged; indeed, are yet mainly on
this side of the river. "Tell General Burnside that he had better, by
all means, throw some of Hooker's in." Burnside replies that he has
directly ordered Hooker to go in, and that every man on this side of
the river shall cross.</p>

<p>At four o'clock General Hooker, who had not yet been across the
river, proceeded over, and, in half an hour, prodigious volleys of
musketry announced that Hooker with the reserves is engaged.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Day is Lost.</hi></p>

<p>This last assaulting column consisted of the divisions of Humphrey,
Monk, Howard, Getty, and Sykes. They had, however, hardly got fairly
engaged before the sun went down, and night closed around the
clamorous wrath of the combatants. At this time General Burnside, who
had remained all day at the Phillips House, came down to the Lacey
House, and in the garden facing the city followed the progress of the
light. Externally calm, the leading player in this tremendous game was
agitated by such intensity of feeling as no one can conceive, and he
paced the garden gloomy as night. "That crest," he exclaimed
passionately, "must be carried to-night." The brevity of time into
which the stupendous issue of the day had to be crowded seemed to add
redoubled energy to the fury of the combatants.</p>

<p>Not "Night, or Blucher !" as Wellington exclaimed at Waterloo, but
rather Ajax's prayer for "more light," was the prompting of every
heart.</p>

<p>Creeping up on the flank by the left, Getty's troops succeeded in
gaining the stone wall which we had been unable all day to wrench from
the rebels. The other forces rushed for the crest. Our
field-batteries, which, owing to the restricted space, had been of
little use all day, were brought vigorously into play. It was the
fierce, passionate climax of the battle. From both sides, two miles of
batteries belched forth their fiery missiles athwart the dark
background of the night. Volleys of musketry were poured forth such as
we have no parallel of in our experience of the war, and which seemed
as though all the demons of earth and air were contending
together. Rushing up the crest, our troops had got within a stone's
throw of the batteries, when the hilltop swarmed forth in new
reinforcements of rebel infantry, who, rushing upon our men, drove
them back. The turn of a die decides such situations. The day was
lost. Our men retired. Immediately cannon and musketry ceased their
roar, and in a moment the silence of death succeeded the stormy fury
of ten hours' battle.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Recrossing of the Rappahannock by
the Federals. </hi></p>

<p>At daylight on Sunday, the 14th inst., heavy artillery firing took
place in front of the divisions of Generals Hooker, Sumner, and
Franklin, and continued until late in the forenoon, but no general
action occurred. The object of both parties was evidently to fool the
other.</p>

<p>During Saturday night and Sunday morning the Confederates
considerably extended their works and strengthened their
position. Large bodies of troops were to be seen on Sunday where few
were to be found on the previous day. The Federal dead which were
killed in front of the enemy's works still remained on Sunday morning
where they fell. When an attempt was made on Saturday night to remove
them, the enemy would open fire with infantry; the wounded were,
however, all removed from the field.</p>

<p>The weather on Sunday was bright and cheerful, and the fog had
entirely disappeared. It was ascertained by inspection through a
powerful glass that there were six distinct lines of works behind the
city. Whether some of these were rifled redoubts simply, or have the
double capacity of affording protection to light infantry, and having
embrasures for light field-guns, could not be discovered. The
appearance of the works, however, would lead to the latter
belief.</p></q>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> of the 15th ult. gives
the following account of the recrossing of the Rappahannock by the
Federals:--</p>
<q><p>There were 40,000 of our troops engaged in the battle of
Saturday. What force the rebels brought against them it is impossible
just now to determine, but from the desperate nature of the resistance
offered it is not improbable that they fully equalled if they did not
outnumber our forces.</p>

<p>With the exception of some heavy firing between the outposts of
both armies there was no fighting on the Rappahannock on Monday (15th
inst.) Everything was quiet, and the terrible battle of Saturday was
not renewed. The Federal troops were busy removing the wounded to the
river side, lest the enemy should shell the city. The Confederates
meanwhile were actively engaged strengthening their defences. At one
time they made a feint to attack General Franklin's forces, but did
not accomplish it. General Burnside inspected the Federal troops in
the afternoon in the town, and was greeted with loud cheers. Activity
throughout every department indicated that a battle was imminent. The
Irish brigade assembled in and around the theatre, where the ceremony
of presenting to it a set of beautiful colours, just sent from New
York, was gone through, General Meagher making an address. The enemy
kept up a regular fire from their batteries upon the upper crossing,
in order to retard the passage of the troops. The surgeons were
ordered to be in readiness to receive and care for a large number of
additional wounded, and red flags were displayed on the tops of many
of the large houses in the town which were to be used for temporary
hospitals.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the Federal forces from Fredericksburg had,
however, been determined on at a council of all the corps commanders
during the day. It was regarded as a perilous undertaking, but one
that, if successful, would rescue the army from the necessity of
risking another battle with the prospect of accomplishing little
except the destruction of valuable lives.</p>

<p>The troops had received no intimation of their having to retreat,
and had laid down to rest upon their arms for the night. The order for
them to fall in was therefore supposed by many to be for a night
assault upon the enemy's works, and they were not undeceived until
they found themselves upon the pontoon bridges actually returning
across the stream. A heavy gale of wind which blew all sound away from
the rebel lines greatly facilitated the movement. Bridges were covered
with earth to deaden the sound of the moving artillery, and a dark
night hid every object from view. General Franklin's grand division,
occupying the extreme left, began to move as soon as it was dark; and
the right and centre of Generals Sumner and Hooker took up the line of
march almost simultaneously, moving in good order but silently away
from under the very guns of the enemy. All three of the crossings were
used, making six bridges. No accident of consequence occurred. The
troops obeyed with alacrity every order, and waited with patience
their turn to cross. The artillery and infantry alternated in moving
column, very much in the order in which they went into battle. Two
brigades belong to General Butterfield's corps were left to occupy
Fredericksburg as advanced pickets. The Federal Artillery placed on
the hither bank of the river co-operated in keeping possession of the
town.</p></q>

<p>The same paper, of the 17th ult., says, in its summary of war
news:--</p>
<q><p>The retreat and evacuation of Fredericksburg, which were
rendered necessary by the disaster of Saturday, and the ascertained
strength and extent of the enemy's fortifications, was a perilous
adventure, but was conducted in safety. It may be consoling, however,
to know that, although the Union forces suffered a loss of some ten or
twelve thousand men in this fruitless attack upon the enemy's
position, General Burnside did not fall too deeply into the trap laid
for him by General Lee, but retired in time to save his army from the
chances of annihilation. It is but just, perhaps, to General Burnside
to say that the adverse movement upon Fredericksburg was not
undertaken in accordance with his own judgment, but was peremptorily
ordered by the military authorities at Washington, who, of course, are
alone responsible for the result. It is stated upon reliable authority
that the rebels sent a notification to our army on Sunday that they
intended shelling the town, and requested that our wounded should be
removed.</p></q></div2>

<p>We have before us another work which is also peculiarly suited to
the moment. It is written by Mr. D. W. Mitchell, an Englishman who has
been a resident in Richmond, Virginia, and is entitled <hi rend="italic">Ten Years in
the United States. Being an Englishman's View of Men and Things in the
North and South</hi> (Smith and Elder). The author states his object to be
to explain, if possible, the most active and powerful causes of the
great revolution which has taken place in the country in which he
lived, working for his livelihood, and, at the same time, observing
human nature as developed in Americans and American politics. The
residence of Mr. Mitchell in the States commenced in 1848, that year
of European convulsions; and he states with confidence that he has
better opportunity than common of observing and understanding the
people of whom he has written, their habits and feelings, their
private and public life, and believes himself capable of pointing out
the causes of the split between North and South, not the less because he,
with some few others, had marked their rise and progress, and
reflected upon the tendency of the life, political and social, of the
United States. The author declares that, in considering and explaining
the facts which he has here collected, he had to abandon many
preconceived ideas and theories of his own, formed before he went to
the States; and he admits that it is more than probable that some of
the statements he has put forth will conflict with the prejudices and
principles of many of his readers; but he protests that he has written
carefully and conscientiously, with a desire to arrive at the truth as
to the right and wrong of the momentous struggle now going on, sinking
for the time sectarian and party prepossessions. The conclusion to
which he arrives is that the separation of the North and South are not
only natural but desirable; that it therefore inevitably follows, as a
matter of course, he does not hesitate to add, that true liberty and
real progress will suffer no drawback from such a change. There will
probably be those who, in learning these premonitory confessions of a
writer on this vexed question, who has been almost a citizen of the
Southern capital too, will at once conclude that he is a writer in the
Confederate interest purely. Well, perhaps he is so, but to a great
extent unconsciously, if not unavoidably; and if his work is taken up
with just so much qualification as is implied in these two
circumstances of avowal of opinion on the broad question and local
tendencies, we think, on the whole, that it will be found to have
dealt with the case as nearly fairly and impartially as
possible. Apart from the political disquisitions which the volume
contains, there is a good deal of characteristic local colouring. The
plan of the book is founded on the notion of endeavouring, as far as
possible, to let the people of the United States describe themselves,
and to let the parties and factions state their own views; and we are
informed that many remarks and reflections which are not printed as
quotations may be taken to be the deliberate opinions of enlightened
Americans, expressed in conversations and discussions at times when
hackneyed professions of party were for the hour forgotten. It should
be observed that the work contains sketches of life and manners,
social and political, at Richmond, at Washington, and at New York
mainly, and some chapters are devoted to somewhat remote--for
America--history, from which deductions are drawn and brought to bear
on modern and immediate circumstances. Even if it had no other merit,
the earlier chapters, which do something for raising the close veil
which now envelopes the South, its inhabitants, and their ways, would
make this book acceptable; but we venture to think that, as a whole,
it is a contribution of some value to the knowledge of the United
States of America, which most of us are glad to come across at this
particular juncture.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICAN MAPS.</p>

<p>Series of American Maps, published by Bacon and Co.,
Paternoster-row, 1862:--1. "Army Map of the Seat of War in Virginia,
showing the Battle-fields, Fortifications, &amp;c., on and near the
Potomac river."--This map gives with the greatest clearness all the
physical features and military positions between the Shenandoah River
on the west and Eastern Maryland on the east. Northwards it extends as
far as the Confederates reached in their recent foray into Maryland,
and southward as far as the Rapidan and Fredericksburg. Within these
limits this map leaves nothing to be desired in the minuteness, and at
the same time lucidity, of its topographical details. It is brought
down to Sept. 1, and gives the site of the battle in which General
Kearney was killed. The successive chains of mountains, the rivers,
railroads, and common roads stand out with great distinctness. Of all
military maps of Eastern Virginia which we have seen we prefer this
for reference.--2. "Bacon's New War Map."--This covers a larger field
than No. 1. It includes a portion of Southern Pennsylvania, all
Maryland, Delaware, all Eastern and a part of Western Virginia, and
terminates at the northern boundary of North Carolina. A pink dash
under the names of notorious places materially assists the
investigator in his hunt after localities.--3. "Bacon's Military Map
of America."--This map is a handy map of the United States, British
America, and adjoining portions of Mexico. It extends from ocean to
ocean. Although entitled "military" by virtue of its showing the forts
and fortifications, it is mainly civil in its character. The loyal
Slave States and parts of States and territories are coloured yellow,
interposed between the Free-labour States in green, and the
Confederate States and parts of States in pink.--4. "Bacon's
Steel-plate Map of the American States, showing the railways, forts,
and fortifications." This map terminates about 100 miles west of the
Mississippi. It includes the adjacent part of Canada, and retains this
threefold division as to colour which characterises No. 3.</p>

<p>American Maps, published by W. and A. K. Johnston, Edinburg,
1862:--1. "Map of the Battle-fields of America, including portions of
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania." This neat map extends south of
Richmond, James River. A blue line under the names of noted places
aids the eye. Appended to this map is a smaller one of the United and
Confederate States, British America, and part of Mexico. The
Free-labour, Border, and Seceded States are distinguished from each
other by separate colours.--2. "Johnson's map of the United
States."--This map is a converse of the previous one. It consists of
two parts. The larger part gives the United States to 100 miles west
of the Mississippi: the smaller section map is a lucid map of the seat
of war in Eastern Virginia, from Harrisburg and Philadelphia in the
North to below Richmond and Norfolk in the South. The maps of this
series are made to fold conveniently in bookform, or they may be
extended sheetwise.</p>

<p>Colton's Series of Maps. Gun and Co., Craven-street.--"2500 Miles
Around Washington."--At the distance of each 100 miles from the centre
a circle is drawn to enable the inquirer to measure the distance at a
glance. The principal places are indicated by a large dot adjoining
their names. The population of the United States, as they were
according to the three last censuses, is given in tabular form.--"500
Miles Round Cairo, showing the Seat of War in the West."--The same
division by circles is adopted here. Both the maps of this series give
every county and county town in clear type.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent at the
head-quarters of the Confederate army of Northern Virginia has
forwarded to us some Illustrations, which we have been fortunate
enough to receive. This, it seems, is far from being the case
generally, many of his sketches and letters being intercepted. For
example, writing on the 15th of November last, our Artist states that
he had just heard of the capture of a vessel which had some of his
despatches on board, and also of the arrest of a messenger carrying
letters and sketches from him across the Potomac into
Maryland. Indeed, our Special Artist on one occasion recently ran a
great risk of being taken prisoner, having galloped past a cross-road
only a few minutes before a Federal scouting-party dashed through. Two
of our Artist's Illustrations are presented on the preceding page.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Advance of the Federals Towards
Lee Town, Jefferson</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">County, Virginia.</hi></p>

<p>Respecting this Illustration our Correspondent writes as
follows:--</p>
<p>"While visiting General Stuart at his head-quarters the Federals
crossed the Potomac at Shepherdstown and advanced in large force to
within a mile and a half of our camp. Gradually our pickets had to
retire, making a good fight as they fell back, step by step, on their
supports. The night we passed was a most anxious one, as at any moment
the Federal cavalry, had they possessed anything like the dash of the
two or three regiments opposed to them, might have forced our lines
and probably taken most of us prisoners. In the morning, Oct. 16, the
General was in the saddle at dawn, and, taking with him Pelham's
flying artillery, brought one of the pieces into a commanding
position, on a hill, and opened it with great effect on a brigade
advancing on Lee Town, driving back the skirmishers thrown forward
against his own pickets. The Illustration shows the gun coming into
action under the fire of the Yankee skirmishers, surrounded and
followed by the mounted gunners, one of whom is falling, wounded, from
his horse. The cavalry reserves are moving up in the rear.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Retreat Of The Federals From
Jefferson County.</hi></p>

<p>"This Engraving (says our Special Artist) gives a new feature to
the triumphal advance of the 'Young Napoleon' on Winchester, so
boastfully published to the world in the Northern papers. The 'onward
movement' has now become a retreat. In the distance the Federal
artillery has taken up a covering position in the road at the entrance
of the woods, and their cavalry is seen flying across the fields on
each side, seeking the shelter of the timber from the shells which
Pelham is liberally sending after them. General Stuart is on a rise in
the centre of the picture, giving orders and making dispositions for
his troopers to charge, the reserve cavalry having come up. By night
not a Federal remained on the Virginia side of the Potomac of those
who formed part of this triumphal expedition."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Confederate Flag.</hi></p>

<p>Our Special Artist inclosed in one of his despatches a flag which
he had begged for us as a trophy, and of which we herewith give an
Engraving. This is its history, as supplied by him:--"When Banks,
commanding the Federals, was attacked by Jackson last spring, and
driven pell-mell through the streets of Winchester, Miss Laura Lee, of
that city, boldly stood forward in the street amidst the flying
bullets and waved this little flag of her own make, cheering on the
Confederate soldiers as they charged through the flying ranks of those
who had covered her and her fellow-citizens with abuse for
months. More than one Confederate fell at her feet as they swept
triumphantly past, and, still waving her little flag in one hand, with
the other assisted the wounded men. This lady is a fair type of all
her Southern sisters--womanly, but brave in her country's cause, and
now praying by the dying beds of those brave men who have fallen
victim to their patriotism."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Claiming Exemption from the
Draught in New York.</hi></p>

<p>Though the draught is postponed in New York it has not been
formally abandoned by the Government. The consequence is that there
has been a great rush to the offices appointed by the Judge
Advocate-General to examine claims of exemption. The claims allowed
are firstly, age under eighteen or over forty-five; secondly, physical
incapacity; thirdly, colour (no negroes or mulattoes being accepted);
fourthly, alien birth and non-naturalisation; fifthly, membership of
the scholastic and clerical professions. A popular caricature recently
represented one of the unwilling conscripts as saying, in answer to
the commissioner's question why he claimed exemption, "I am sixty
years of age; I am an Irishman; my mother was a nigger; I have a
humpback and a clubfoot; I am a confirmed drunkard; and I am a
preacher of the gospel." "You may go, Sir," replied the
commissioner. "Your case is but too complete." The most numerous
claims of exemption have been made by Irishmen and other foreigners,
armed with their passports and consular papers to prove their
nationality. At least fifty thousand such claims are said to have been
allowed. Another numerous class is that of which the members could
only plead their physical disability--such as deafness, short-sight,
malformation of the hand or foot, and, in some instances, inveterate
and incurable dipsomania, proved on the oath of the wives of the
unfortunate delinquents. Another large class is said--but perhaps it is
a libel--to have been composed of men who before the draught was
threatened represented themselves to be from thirty-five to forty
years of age, but who suddenly discovered, after perusal of
Mr. Lincoln's demand for 300,000 conscripts, that they were certainly
forty-six. In all these cases the commissioners insisted upon the
certificate of birth. Our Engraving represents the interior of the
Office of Exemption in the fifteenth ward of the city during the time
when the draught was considered imminent and had been positively fixed
to take place at the end of November.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">The West Indies, Free Labour, and</p>
<p rend="center">Cotton.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Ever</hi> since the commencement of the cotton
dearth, and, indeed, on more than one occasion anterior to it, certain
gentlemen whose names we need not specify, but the authenticity and
adequacy of whose information on the matter we propose submitting to
the notice of our readers cannot be reasonably doubted, have done
their utmost to direct the attention of the British public to the
capabilities of the West Indian islands and mainland, and more
particularly of Jamaica, for the culture and preparation of cotton for
the European market.  According to their testimony, it would be
difficult to select within cotton-growing latitudes any other area of
equal extent possessed of so many recommendations for the cultivation
of the precious staple.  It has been proved by actual experiment that
the plant grown in the West Indies may, with ordinary care, be so
reared as to exhibit all the superior qualities, and to command at
Liverpool the best prices, of Sea Island cotton.  It is notorious that
in Jamaica and Guiana immense tracts of suitable land lie waste,
partly in consequence of the ingrossing care devoted to the production
of sugar, but chiefly to a lack of a sufficient number of labouring
population. It is obvious that the position of the Antilles in
relation to Europe is but little less favourable for the transport of
merchandise than that of the Slave States of America.  It is asserted that
even now the labour requisite for cotton plantations can be secured at
a rate of wages which would leave to all parties engaged in the
culture and carriage of the article ample remuneration; but it is
admitted that a large accession of hands would be required to enable
the West Indies to develop, to anything like the extent of which it is
capable and which the wants of Europe demand, a new cotton-growing
interest which shall fully compensate for the loss of the old one.</p>

<p>Now, it happens that, to the powerful arguments urged in favour of
any well-considered scheme for realising the above-named advantages,
the course of events having its course in the American civil conflict
furnishes a series of nearly equal cogency. It was well known that the
fortune of war has placed in the hands of the Federal Government above
200,000 "contrabands,"--i.e., slaves who have either been captured by
the invading troops or who have escaped from their Southern masters to
the Federal camps. These coloured people have become a burden upon the
hands of Mr. Lincoln, and a cause of serious perplexity to his
Cabinet. What is to be done with them? There seem to be strong
objections, physical as well as social, to using them as soldiers. To
transport the whole of them to Liberia would require a respectable
navy, and would entail upon the North an enormous expense.  The
jealousy of the Free States against allowing negro labour to come into
competition with the labour of whites is too strong and active to
admit of a gradual absorption of the African element into the
industrial population.  Meanwhile, they have to be fed and sheltered
at the public expense.  During the continuance of the war, it is true,
a large number of "contrabands" may be employed in the construction of
military works and in performing the duties of the more menial camp
offices.  But their number is constantly on the increase and what
shall be done with them when the present struggle has ceased is a
problem which the lapse of every month renders at the same time more
pressing and more difficult of solution.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have two conditions which, whenever they can be
united, will realise a consummation equally advantageous to us, to our
West Indian colonies, to the Federal<pb n="34"/> Government and people of America,
to the captured and liberated negroes, and to the cause of
humanity. There is a soil waiting for labourers, and there are
labourers waiting for a soil. They are not far distant from each
other. The negroes themselves appear willing enough to go, for the
great success of the black emigrants to the Northern States of Hayti
has proved that in this instance deportation has no necessary
connection with misery. The authorities and planters of the West
Indian Islands are not only willing but eager to receive them, and to
give such reasonable security as may be demanded for respecting their
personal freedom and giving them profitable employment. The Government
at Washington, on such securities being entered into, will not only
let the coloured labourers depart, but will themselves convey, or be
at the expense of conveying, them to their new home. Mr. Adams, the
American Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, has broached the
question to Earl Russell, her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, and has intimated the readiness of the Federal Government to
enter into a convention with that of the United Kingdom for the
removal, to any of the West India colonies, of the blacks in America
to whom the present war has given or may give liberty.</p>

<p>Where, then, is the obstacle, and of what kind is it, that a
proposal which meets the wishes of so many parties is not forthwith
carried into effect? From the tenour of a despatch forwarded by the
Duke of Newcastle to the Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica it appears
that the British Government are not prepared to enter into such a
convention as that suggested by Mr. Adams; and, from the published
diplomatic correspondence of the American Ambassador, it seems that
our Cabinet, after discussing the subject with fitting seriousness,
came to the conclusion that, "on the whole, it might be the means of
entangling them in some way or other with the difficulties in the
United States, by possible reclamations of fugitives, or in some other
way--a danger which they were most desirous to avoid." However much the
decision is to be regretted, the evident anxiety of the British
Government to avoid furnishing a pretext of quarrel to either of the
belligerents in America will command the approval of the English
public. How far this excessive caution should be carried is a question
not very easy to be determined; and perhaps it is better that those
who are responsible for the maintenance of international amity, should
err on the side of apprehension rather than of recklessness. But,
supposing the reason assigned by Earl Russell for declining the offer
of Mr. Seward to be the only one that exists, it is a fair question
for consideration whether our Government are not abnegating national
rights, or, at any rate, abstaining from the exercise of them, beyond
the limits imposed by the exigences of the situation; and whether, on
the ground of what we now refuse to do, demands may not be made upon
us hereafter which we shall certainly resist, even at the cost of
war.</p>

<p>It is matter of notoriety, besides being in strict accordance with
international law, that, as opportunity occurs, we make valid
contracts, whether of purchase or of sale, with both the parties to
the civil war. The tobacco, the rice, or the cotton which reach us,
though in but small quantities, through the North, are just as likely
to have been the property of Confederate planters, and to have changed
hands by other than commercial means during the war, as are the
fugitive negroes. On the Constitutional principles of the Southern
States these now homeless "contrabands" are in precisely the same
position with regard to the outer world as any other article of
property would be which the chances of war had transferred from its
former owner to its present possessor. No nation can pretend, at the
close of a contest with some other nation, that it has a right to
reclaim from those who were neutrals all commodities and "chattels" of
which its citizens may have been deprived by military force, and which
have thereby found their way into the hands of a third party. Besides,
we do not in this country recognise the right of property in
man. Should any one of the African labourers whom our Government
declines to receive in the West Indies, with the double consent of the
Federal Cabinet and of the wretched captives themselves, have found
his way to any part of her Majesty's dominions, even before the period
of the Secession, he would thereupon have become a free man, and we
should have refused the rendition of him to any Power on earth, and at
any risk of consequences. We did so but recently in the case of John
Anderson, who had taken refuge in Canada; and, unquestionably, we
shall do so again and again whenever and by whomsoever reclamation is
made upon us for fugitive slaves. We trust her Majesty's Government
have not, in the excess of their caution, laid ground for the urging
of some such demand upon us when the war shall have ceased. We should
be sorry that an inference could he justly drawn from any decision of
theirs to the effect that the British Government recognise the
doctrine that slaves are property which may be reclaimed, as such, by
one Power from another. That we should surrender or even seem to
ignore an iota of our own national creed in this matter for the sake
of showing our delicate impartiality, does not strike us as dictated
by a far-seeing wisdom. And if, on any question affecting
international relations, no decision can be wholly free from risk, it
does appear to us that a convention with the Federal authorities for
the effectuation of an object so desirable to all parties and in all
senses as the one proposed should not have been refused, lest at some
time hereafter we may be asked by an irritated nation to do what we
never have done and never shall do.</p>

<p>The question will be sure to come up in other shapes before long,
and will probably be determined by Parliamentary authority. The last
advices from Jamaica inform us that notice of motion had been given in
the Assembly of that island for the appointment of a committee to
consider the best means of promoting the immigration of the coloured
and black people of the States. Our own Legislature can hardly evade,
or wish to evade, so important a question. The operatives of
Lancashire who are now subsisting, not without a bitter pang, on
public charity, magnanimously scorned to lessen their own distress by
giving their sanction to the continuance of negro slavery. If, then,
their prospects can be brightened, and the staple of their manufacture
largely increased, by a process which, so far as it goes, will convert
slaves into free man, we cannot but think that they have a genuine
claim upon the consideration of their countrymen. Are we entitled to
shut them out from the most promising advantages which have hitherto
been offered them, lest, by acting upon right principles, we may
hereafter be called to account by a Government founded upon wrong
principles? Of course, we take for granted that, should Parliament
show a disposition to assume the responsibility of accepting
Mr. Seward's offer, the Ministers can urge no further objection to
it. To the arrangement itself, whereby the negroes captured by
Northern arms may, with their own consent, he sent across to the West
Indies, they can offer no opposition but that which arises out of
apprehension for the future; but if the country is resolved to face
the risk of war with the yet unrecognised Confederacy, on grounds
which it can fully justify and be proud of, the Government, we cannot
doubt, will cordially concur in its decision.</p></div2>

<p>The army of the Potomac, though for the moment inactive, will not,
it is said, under its present commander, be suffered to go into winter
quarters.</p>
<p>General Burnside has published a further report in which he
accepts the whole responsibility of the reverse at Fredericksburg and
exonerates the President, General Halleck, and Secretary Stanton from
all blame. He attributes the defeat to the fog and the delay in
building the bridges across the Rappahannock, which gave the
Confederates twenty-four hours more to concentrate their forces in
their strong positions.</p>

<p>The number of wounded on the side of the Federals is finally given,
on the authority of the medical director, to be 7000 instead of 9000,
as previously reported.</p>

<p>The committee appointed by the Senate to inquire into the disaster
at Fredericksburg have presented their report. They examined
Generals Burnside, Hooker, and Franklin, and have presented the
evidence without comment. The Generals agreed that the delay in the
arrival of the pontoon train was fatal, yet it has been impossible to
discover the guilty party, as General Halleck considers his
responsibility terminated with giving the order for their despatch
immediately after the receipt of the request. General Burnside denied
that the troops were demoralised; but General Sumner thought his were,
and that the army required rest.</p>

<p>The report that General Foster had been defeated in North Carolina
was inaccurate. The General pushed on from Kingston and captured
Goldsborough, where he tore up the line of railroad connecting
Wilmington with Richmond, and then retired to Newbern. He fought four
successful engagements, with a loss of about 500 men. En revanche he
captured 500 prisoners and eleven pieces of artillery, with a large
number of small arms.</p>

<p>General Banks's expedition has been sighted on the Gulf of
Mexico. It is confirmed that he will supersede General Butler in the
command of the south-west department.</p>
<p>The Confederates have recaptured Holly Springs, Mississippi. The
Federals lost in this affair 200 killed and wounded and 150 prisoners,
also 500,000 dols. worth of stores.</p>
<p>President Davis has issued a proclamation retaliatory upon
Butler. He and all his officers are to be hung if taken, but their
soldiers are to be paroled. Negroes taken in arms and their officers
are also to be hung.</p>

<p>A large steamer, bringing a heavy stock of shoes, blankets, and
cloth for the Confederate Government, got safely into Charleston
Harbour recently.</p>

<p>General Bonham has been appointed Confederate Governor South
Carolina, in place of General Gregg, killed.</p>

<p>A full account of the interview between the President and the
caucus of Republican senators, who passed a veto of want of confidence
in a part of the President's Cabinet, has been published. The
President heard what the senators had to say, and then respectfully
declined to accede to their request, on the ground that what the
country needed was military success and that his Cabinet Ministers,
"even were they angels," could not guarantee that. The resolution was
principally levelled at Mr. Seward, on account of his conservation in
home politics and his irritating attitude in the management of foreign
affairs. The latter ground was urged by Senator Sumner, the chairman
of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs. In consequence of the
refusal of the President to accept the resignations of Messrs. Seward
and Chase, those gentleman continue to hold office. This is the first
attempt in the course of American Constitutional history to make the
personnel of the Administration dependent on Congress. It has failed
in the present instance.</p>

<p>The President hesitates to sign the bill admitting Western Virginia
as a separate State.</p>
<p>The efforts of the representatives of the Border State men to
induce the President to cancel his proclamation of the 22nd of
September have been futile, but he thinks favourably of their petition
that Tennessee and portions of Eastern Virginia, where manifestations
of loyalty have been made, be excepted from its operation.</p>

<p>Congress, by a vote of 77 against 33 has given leave to report a
bill appropriating 20,000,000 dols. to Missouri to aid her in
emancipating her slaves.</p>

<p>A bill embodying Secretary Chase's proposals for raising
300,000,000 dols. for the service of the current year, and 600,000,
000 dols. for the service of the next fiscal year, has been introduced
into the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe has published in the current number of
the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> a reply to the appeal made to the women of
America by the women of Britain on the subject of slavery ten years
ago. She says that those who felt the weight of that appeal have had
hitherto no leisure to reply to it:--</p>

<p><q>All their time and energies were already absorbed in direct
efforts to remove the great evil concerning which the minds of their
English sisters had been newly aroused, and their only answer was the
silent continuance of these efforts. The time has come, however, when
such an astonishing page has been turned in the anti-slavery history
of America that the women of our country, feeling that the great
anti-slavery work to which their English sisters exhorted them is
almost done, may properly and naturally feel moved to reply to their
appeal, and lay before them the history of what has occurred since the
receipt of their affectionate and Christian address.</q> After giving
her version of the anti-slavery contest in the United States during
the past ten years, and charging English public opinion with a leaning
in favour of the establishment of a slaveholding Confederacy, she
apostrophises the women of England thus:--</p>

<p><q>And now, sisters of England, think it not strange, if we bring
back the words of your letter, not in bitterness but in deepest
sadness, and lay them at your door. We say to you,--Sisters, you have
spoken well; we have heard you; we have heeded; we have striven in the
cause, even unto death. We have sealed our devotion by desolate hearth
and darkened homestead--by the blood of sons, husbands, and
brothers. In many of our dwellings the very light of our lives has
gone out, and yet we accept the life-long darkness as our own part in
this great and awful expiation, by which the bonds of wickedness shall
be loosed, and abiding peace established on the foundation of
righteousness. Sisters, what have you done, and what do you mean to
do? In view of the decline of the noble anti-slavery fire in
England--in view of all the facts and admissions recited from your own
papers--we beg leave, in solemn sadness, to return to you your own
words.</q> The reply is signed by Mrs. Stowe "in behalf of many
thousands of American women."</p><pb n="35"/>

<p>Orders for the supply of the French army in Mexico continue to be
executed in New York. The Mexican Minister has protested, but
Mr. Seward declines to interfere.</p>

<p>Thirty-nine out of the 300 Sioux Indians imprisoned at Dakoa,
Minnesota, were to be hung on the 27th for their complicity with the
massacre of the whites, and fears are entertained that the whites will
"lynch" the rest. The colonel commanding the post has invoked the aid
of the law-abiding portion of the citizens.</p>

<p>The British steamer Scotland has arrived at San Francisco from
Hong-Kong, Shanghai, and Kanagawa. The Scotland is the pioneer of a
new British line of steamers which are to make a monthly trip between
San Francisco, Japan, and China. The charge for freight is 12 dols. a
ton, and for passengers 250 dols. each. The Scotland brought 700 tons
of freight from China, and 300 tons from Japan, principally
teas.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> attitude of the Federals up to the
time of sending away the last mail resembles that of the crew of a
vessel which has just sustained a most terrific shock from a monster
wave. The fierce blow has been delivered, the ship has reeled, and
there ensues a moment of paralysed wonder. By this time, no doubt the
public mind has recovered its elasticity, and is engaged with the
fearful details of the Fredericksburg disaster; but we have only
evidence how the people have been, for once, stunned by a defeat. And
no wonder. A nation that did not feel deeply wounded and humiliated by
such a blow would, indeed, be unworthy. It is not the mere fact that a
fine army has been crushed and its remnant sent in disgrace across the
little river that had been absurdly called its Granicus--heavy reverses
have been sustained ere this, and the beaten side has lost nothing
save the day and many men, and has rallied and retrieved its laurels;
it is that the Fredericksburg disaster is a blow driven home to the
very heart of the American system--a blow which has demonstrated to the
world that the institutions under which such an event is possible can
no longer be relied upon as State mechanism. It is not that an
accident has happened to machinery; it is that the machine has proved
a failure.</p>

<p>General Burnside has had the courage, or tact, or reckless<pb n="39"/>ness to
declare himself solely responsible for the movements which ended in
the carnage of Fredericksburg. But the people are not to be deceived
by any such transparent advice. It may be perfectly true that the
final arrangements for the attack were the General's own; they could
hardly be otherwise; but it is notorious that the advance itself was a
political as much as a military movement, and was a necessity of
party. This is the fatal truth; and in the fact that, in order to
meet the exigencies of party, as understood in America, it is
permitted to slaughter 10,000 men, is or should be the death-sentence
of the present system. It was well known that the attack could be
successful only by a miracle, and M'Clellan had preferred to sacrifice
his own position as head of the army rather than hurl it upon almost
certain destruction. But the party found a General who owned himself
no great master of war, and who did not hesitate to rush upon the
Confederate intrenchments in a way that proved that he had not
under-estimated his own professional ignorance. He was not even
supplied with the means of making his mad attack in the best way; his
pontoons were "forgotten;" and the whole chapter, from the beginning
to the end, was one of misfortune. Still, and here is the most
lamentable thing of all, the politicians of the North do not appear to
consider that anything discreditable has been done. They are staggered
by the magnitude of the slaughter which a party move has caused, but
they are unable to see that such a step was one of guilt, or that the
conduct of a campaign should be dictated by military considerations
and not by the momentary need of a faction. It is difficult for
English readers to realise this state of things. Perhaps they may form
a very rough idea of it by supposing that we are at war with France;
that a French army lies in a very strong position near Boulogne; that
the Government, say Lord Palmerston's, is very unpopular, and public
credit not good; and that Mr. Disraeli's friends have been winning a
great many elections, and threaten a crisis. At this moment, and
desirous to please the people by a sign of vigour, Lord Palmerston and
the War Secretary intimate to Lord Clyde that at all hazards he must
attack the French. Lord Clyde obeys, and leads the army into a
semicircle of fire, where, throughout a whole day, our men are mowed
down by artillery against which he can do nothing. At night he
retreats, leaving ten thousand soldiers on the field; but Lord
Palmerston has asserted his reputation for being in earnest, and
Mr. Disraeli does not give notice of a vote of want of
confidence. That is not a parallel case, but it is sufficiently like
what has occurred to make an English reader indignant that such a
state of things can be held compatible with Christian
civilisation.</p>

<p>This fourth defeat of the North is no doubt very important, but it
is not one which adds much to the glory of the South. The day could
not have gone otherwise than as it did, and Lee and Jackson must have
been astounded at the madness which delivered over the troops of the
North to such inevitable destruction. The Confederates had really
little to do but to serve their guns, and this they did
admirably. Such part of the affair as partook of the nature of a
battle did no discredit to either side, and Jackson himself was either
forced back, or chose to retreat for a considerable distance. We do
not believe the majority of the stories that impute bad fighting to
the Northerners. If they fought badly at all it was because they were
badly led; and the murderous system--there is no other word for it--of
intrusting important movements to officers who have never been
educated and have been chosen by election, is responsible for anything
like disgrace that may have attached to any of the regiments. The
individual American fights excellently while he can depend upon
himself; but the moment he is asked for the soldier's faith in his
officer he is helpless, for he is in the habit of thinking, and his
reason tells him that the officer will probably lead him to be knocked
on the head to no good purpose. Then, very likely, the American walks
away or runs away; but it is sheer insolence to call this
cowardice. Give him officers, and teach him to obey them
unhesitatingly, and the chronicle of this war will tell another
story.</p>

<p>But it is the system that is ruining the fortunes of the Republic,
in the field and out of it. There is no such thing as political
conscience; and the soldiers are as much made the counters in the game
as they ever were in the old monarchical wars of Europe, against which
so many well-deserved taunts used to be launched by popular
writers. Only, upon the old kingly vices the Republicans have
engrafted new ones of their own. The Kings sent their men to the
battle, but it was at least under commanders who knew their business,
and who did not throw away life unnecessarily except under
circumstances of a very peculiar description. Generals were sometimes
accused of not utterly defeating an enemy because it was highly
desirable that he should be left strong enough to ensure another
year's campaign; but when they fought him they did so in a rational
manner, had an object in view, and either gained it or retired in
fitting time if the object were unattainable. But the American system
sends men into the field under the leadership of officers who are
chosen because they have political influence, or can make loud
speeches, or are very liberal with their liquor at the tavern bar; or
even because they have kept a tavern bar, and have not been over harsh
in insisting on the payment of scores. With such machinery of war the
enlightened people of America are content, or have been content, to
fight the greatest contest which the present generation has seen. It
is hardly conceivable that they will not one of these days make short
work with a system which makes a battle a mere savage scramble, to
which (again thanks to the system) men are hounded on to satisfy the
exigencies of faction.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent in
America, having, in common with the correspondents of other European
journals, been curtly refused permission to accompany the Federal
forces, has pitched his tent in the opposite camp, whence, as
opportunity serves, he forwards to us his Illustrations of the
War. Thus it happens, without any intention of the kind on our part or
on that of our Artist, that his Sketches illustrate the varying
aspects of the war from the Confederate instead of from the Federal
point of view, and have possibly, in consequence, a colouring somewhat
different from that which would have marked sketches taken by the same
hand in the camp of the army of the Potomac. However that may be, his
Illustrations cannot fail to be of interest, giving, as they do,
glimpses into what is wellnigh a sealed book--the doings in the
Confederate camp. Our present<pb n="43"/> Number contains three
illustrations by our Special Artist, respecting which he writes as
fellows:--</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Night Amusements in the
Confederate Camp.</hi></p>

<p>"Every evening, when we cluster around our pine-log fires, the
'darkies' press in amongst us and listen to the yarns their masters
spin.  In our camp we are fortunate enough to possess the most famous
banjo-player in the Southern States, and when Sweeny strikes up one of
his quaint old Virginian breakdowns, some nigger is sure to 'wade' in
and put his legs through a series of marvelous gyrations, to the delight
of the sympathetic lookers-on, who beat time for him.  Although the
enemy is within cannon-shot, no one experiences the least uneasiness,
and the universal refrain is, 'We'll sing to-night and fight
to-morrow--bullyboys, oh!'"</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General Longstreet's Corps
Crossing the Blue Ridge, Virginia.</hi></p>

<p>"Of the entire Confederate army encamped near Winchester Jackson's
corps alone remains, and that, I presume, will soon follow the main
body into Loudon County, where Burnside menaces with an immense army
the line of the Rappahannock in this, the third, advance of the
Federals on Richmond.  The subject of the Engraving is one of the
picturesque passes through on its way to Culpepper to hold in check
the Northern forces.  The scenery of these Virginian mountains
reminds me forcibly of the Apennines, and recalls many scenes which I
have witnessed with Garibaldi's forces in Southern Italy."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Position Of The Federal And The

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Fredericksburg On
Dec. 4.</hi></p>

<p>"The Rappahannock at Fredericksburg (writes our Artist on the day
he took the above Sketch) is scarcely more than a hundred yards in
width, and this is the distance that divides the Confederates from the
Federals.  The pickets of each army are within earshot and in full
view of each other, and they frequently indulge in remarks that might
be taken exception to in polite society.  While making the
accompanying Sketch a sentinel who was leaning on his musket, looking over me,
suddenly called out to a blue-coated German on the other side, 'How
many men have you got over thar, Yank?'  'Doo or dree dousand,' grunted
the Teuton.  'Oh, bring them along; that's nothing.  We reckoned you
had an army!'  It is whispered at head-quarters to-day that an attempt
will be made by the enemy to cross the river at three different points
during the night.  Everything is ready for them when they come, and
the battle that will possibly take place within the next few days must
determine, as far as the Federals are concerned, whether the war is to
continue or not: it will be by far the largest and most important of
the whole campaign.  Probably not less than 250,000 men will be
engaged.  I am lying out in the pine-woods at the advance, ready to
wield my pencil when the struggle begins.  Every shot we hear as we
lie with our feet to the fire during the long cold nights starts us on
our legs, for we know the enemy has his pontoons ready to cross in the
darkness.  What a bursting of shells over my bed there will be when
the ball opens!"</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Fredericksburg.</hi></p>

<p>The little town of Fredericksburg, which has been rendered famous
by the great battle fought near it on the 13th ult., had previously
suffered rough usage, having been alternately in the hands of
Confederates and Federals two or three times.  It is the chief town of
Spottsylvania county, Virginia, and is situated on the right bank of
the Rappahannock River at the head of tidewater.  It is between fifty
and sixty miles from Richmond by railroad, and sixty-five miles by the
turnpike, in a northerly direction.  The town is pleasantly situated
in a fertile valley, and has advantages for commerce and
manufactures. The railroad from Washington, vi&#x00E0; Acquia Creek,
passes through it, and as the through-trams generally stop at
Fredericksburg Station for about an hour on each trip, a not
inconsiderable chance trade was cause thereby in the immediate
locality of the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t. A good canal has bee constructed
from the town to a point on the Rappahannock River about forty miles
above, by which large quantities of wheat, flour, and tobacco were
formerly received for exportation. The river affords extensive water
power, which, however, has not been much used.  The hills in the
neighborhood, varying from forty to one hundred feet high, abound in
fine granite and freestone.</p>

<p>About thirty years since the prospect of Fredericksburg being a
rapidly-rising town was very great; but it suddenly stopped in its
prosperity, and after, as it were, standing still for about twenty
years, gradually retrograded in importance.  In 1840 its population
numbered 4000 souls, and in 1850, ten years after, it had only
increased eighty-eight persons--less than nine each year, and being
about two per cent in the decade--a remarkably small increase.  Before
the war it contained five churches, one orphan asylum, two
seminaries, four newspaper-offices and two banks.  Such <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
Fredericksburg.  The correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reports:--"It
is 'living' Fredericksburg no more.  A city, soulless, rent by the
wrack of war, and shooting up in flames athwart night's sky is the pretty
little antique spot by the Rappahannock, erewhile the peculiar scene
of dignified ease and retirement."</p>

<p>The Rappahannock River rises in the Blue Ridge, but a few miles
from the fork of the Shenandoah, and pursues an easterly course to
Fredericksburg, some sixty miles south-south-west of Washington city,
where it is within ten miles of the Potomac.  It has here become a
broad navigable stream, though its extreme sources are hardly eighty
miles distant.  From Fredericksburg it has a general south-east course
till it is lost in Chesapeake Bay, some twenty-five miles below the
mouth of the Potomac.  For the present its course below Fredericksburg
is commanded by the Union gun-boats, but above that city it becomes
disputable, and has for months in good part divided the Union from the
Confederate forces.  It naturally forks towards its source into
innumerable streams and rivulets, but at first, some ten miles above
Fredericksburg, into two main branches, whereof that coming from the
north-west retains the name of Rappahannock, while that from the
south-west is known as the Rapidan.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CAREER OF THE ALABAMA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Mr. S. M. Underhill</hi>, writing from St. Thomas, West Indies,
furnishes the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> with a short history of the career of the
Confederate war-steamer Alabama, obtained from the late boatswain of
the "290":--</p>

<q><p>The "290" was built by Mr. Laird, the eminent shipbuilder at
Birkenhead, under contract with a Mr. Butcher. She was regularly
contracted and paid for; and as nothing transpired during her
construction to warrant the supposition that she was destined to hoist
the ensign of the Southern Confederacy, no laws of neutrality were
infringed. Indeed, it was hinted that the vessel was intended for the
service of the Emperor of China. Her keel was laid in the beginning of
this year (1862), and she was launched in April thereafter, though she
was not ready for sea for the succeeding three months. The "290" is
simply a large wooden screw gun-boat, such a vessel as is in European
navies styled a corvette. She is very strongly built of the best
materials, and is constructed to carry ten guns--viz., one rifled
100-pounder, one 68-pounder, and eight 32-pounders--i.e., four
32-pounders on each broadside, throwing collectively 128lb. solid shot
at each discharge, and two pivot guns. She is barque-rigged, and is
fitted with a pair of very powerful engines, by Penn, of London. She
left Birkenhead towards the end of July, ostensibly on a trial-trip,
having on board a large party of ladies and gentleman. On getting out
of the Mersey, this party was sent back in a tug-boat, and the "290,"
as had been previously arranged, neglected to return to Birkenhead,
but steamed direct for the island in the Atlantic where she was to
take in her guns, ammunition, &amp;c. On leaving England, the "290" had a
crew of ninety-three men, for the most part belonging to the English
Naval Reserve, all being trained gunners, and the majority old
men-of-war's men. She was temporarily commanded by Captain Bullock,
who had under him the proper complement of commissioned and petty
officers. Captain Bullock, having learned that the Tuscarora lay in
wait for him in St. George's Channel, took his departure by what is
known as the North Channel, thus eluding his Federal enemy; though
even had he been intercepted the Northener would have found himself in
a dilemma, as the "290" had a set of English papers, and other
presumptive proofs of her neutrality, in the face of which it might
have been difficult for her captor to have acted. The "290" at this
time carried no guns or other warlike stores, but consisted merely of
the hull, spars, and engines, except, of coarse, coal and other
requisites to enable her to reach her destination, which was Tarissa,
one of the Azores or Western Islands, belonging to Portugal. This
destination the "290" duly reached, after a fine run of eight days,
and came to an anchor in Tarissa Roads, nothing of any moment having
occurred to break the usual monotony of a sea voyage.</p>

<p>Some time before the departure of the "290" from the Mersey a large
barque left the Thames (cleared for Demerara, West Indies) to meet the
"290" at Tarissa, and there transfer to the latter vessel the guns and
stores destined for her, and which formed the cargo of the
barque. Some reason required to be assigned to the Portuguese
authorities for the " 290" having anchored in their bay, and
accordingly the excuse furnished to them was that her engines had
broken down. This plea was accepted as a valid one, and during the
week that intervened betwixt the arrival at Tarissa of the "290" and
the barque the crew of the former vessel were engaged ostensibly in
repairing her engines, but really in preparing her to receive her
guns, &amp;c. About the lapse of a week from the arrival of the "290" the
barque above mentioned sailed in and anchored, her captain alleging as
a reason to the Portuguese officials that his vessel had sprung a
leak, which would require to be repaired ere she could resume her
voyage; and on this understanding the Portuguese at once placed her in
quarantine(which in the Azores lasts three days). On the day after the
barque's arrival, Captain Bullock, of the "290," being anxious to get
his guns on board, hauled alongside of the barque, and erected a pair
of large shears to effect the transfer of her cargo from the barque's
hold to the "290's" deck. This brought off the Portuguese in a fury
that their rules should have been broken by the "290" having dared to
communicate with a vessel which had still two days' quarantine to run,
and they angrily demanded to know the reason why their regulations had
been infringed.  They were told that the barque was in a sinking
state, and the erection of the shears was accounted for by urging the
necessity for an immediate temporary transfer of her cargo, that the
leak might be reached and stopped; and Captain Bullock finally
succeeded in bearing down all opposition by feigning to get in
passion, saying he was doing no more for the barque than any
Englishman would do for a countryman in distress. The Portuguese left
the vessel, and the transhipment proceeded without farther hindrance
from these on shore.</p>

<p>About the afternoon of the second day, and when the transfer was
nearly complete, the British screw-steamer Bahama came in, having on
board Captain Semmes and the other late officers of the Sumter, besides
the remainder of the "290's" armament, and an addition of twenty odd
men to her crew. On the Bahama's arrival and anchorage on a somewhat
similar pretext to those given to her two predecessors, the Portuguese
fairly lost all patience, and peremptorily insisted on the instant
departure of all three vessels. The Bahama at once communicated with
the "290," and, having handed over to the latter vessel everything
destined for her, got up steam and left, followed by the "290," towing
the now empty barque. All three went, not to sea, as they had been
ordered to do, but to Angra Bay (a bay in the same island, and only a
few leagues distant from Tarissa Roads). Here they remained unmolested
until noon the following day (a Sunday), when, for the second time,
all three vessels were ordered out of the Portuguese waters. All the
"290'," guns being now mounted, and the vessel otherwise ready for a
cruise, the order was obeyed, and all took their departure, the
barque, as before, in tow of the "290," which, having convoyed her
well out to sea, cast her off, and with a favouring breeze she steered
for Cardiff, to bring out a further supply of coal for the "290's"
future use. The "290" and the Bahama now steamed round the island, and
Captain Semmes, coming out of his cabin, ordered his First Lieutenant
to muster the crew aft. This having been done, and all the officers
assembled on the poop in their full uniform (i.e., Confederate grey
frock-coat and trousers), Captain Semmes, enjoined silence, and read
his commission as Post Captain in the Confederate Navy. It was a
document duly attested at Richmond, and bore the signature of
"Jeff. Davis, President Confederate States of America." He then opened
and read his sealed orders from the President, directing him to assume
command of the Confederate sloop of war Alabama, hitherto known as the
"290," in which (having been duly commissioned) he was to hoist the
Confederate ensign and pennant, and "sink, burn, and destroy
everything which flew the ensign of the so-called United States of
America." Captain Semmes then ordered the First Lieutenant to fire a
gun and run up the Confederate flag and pennant. The gun was fired by
the Second Lieutenant (Armstrong, a relation of the famous inventor),
and ere its smoke had cleared away the stars and bars of the young
Confederacy were floating on the breeze, and the ceremony was
complete--Captain Semmes declaring the vessel henceforth to be known as
the Alabama to have been duly commissioned. The next step was formally
to engage the crew to serve and fight under the Southern flag, which
having been done, the men were addressed by their captain in an
eloquent and stirring speech, in the course of which he said there
were only four vessels in the United States' Navy that were more than
a match for the Alabama; but he said that in an English-built heart of
oak as she was, and surrounded as he then saw himself by British
hearts of oak, he wouldn't strike his newly-hoisted flag for any one
of the four. Of course this elicited a hearty burst of cheering for
President, States, and Captain, and, when it had subsided, Captain
Semmes said the Bahama was on the point of leaving for England, and
intimiated that if any of his crew repented of the step they had
taken, they were free to return in her. This alternative none would
accept; and Captain Bullock and a few of the other officers who had
taken the "290" from England to the Azores, finding their occupation
gone, through the arrival of those who had held similar appointments
in the Sumter, having gone on board the Bahama, that vessel and the
Alabama, amidst hearty cheering from the crews at both, parted
company, the former pursuing her course back to England, the latter in
chase of a Yankee whaler, which she captured and burned. This was her
first prize, and her subsequent career is now so famous as to render a
single remark thereon superfluous. The Alabama's crew receive from the
Confederate Government half the value of every American ship and cargo
they destroy, and each of her crew is now worth several hundred
pounds. All obligations to them have hitherto been faithfully
discharged in gold. The Alabama is supplied with coal from Wales by
three sailing-vessels thus constantly employed.</p></q></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the steamers Etna and Bohemian we have New York
journals of the 3rd inst., and telegrams to the afternoon of that
day. The most important item of intelligence is the issue of</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Emancipation
Proclamation.</hi></p>

<p>After reciting the previous conditional proclamation of
Sept. 22, the President proceeds to declare as follows:--</p>

<q><p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of
the Army and Navy of the United States, in time of actual armed
rebellion against the authority and Government of the United States,
and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion,
do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose to do
so, publicly proclaim for the full period of one hundred days from the
day of the first above-mentioned order, and designate as the States
and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively are this
day in rebellion against the United States, the following, to
wit:--</p>

<p>Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana--except the parishes of St. Bernard,
Placquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension,
Assumption, Terra Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans,
including the city of New Orleans--Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia--except the
forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the
counties of Berkley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York,
Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and
Portsmouth, and which excepted parts are for the present left
precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.</p>

<p>And, by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do
aver and declare that all persons held as slaves within said
designated States and parts of States are and henceforward shall be
free, and that the Executive Government of the United States,
including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognise
and maintain the freedom of said persons.</p>

<p>And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to
abstain from all violence unless in necessary self-defense, and I
recommend to them that in all cases, when allowed, they labour
faithfully for reasonable wages.</p>

<p>And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable
condition will be received into the armed service of the United
States, to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and
to man vessels of all sorts in said service.</p>

<p>And, upon this--sincerely believed to be an act of justice,
warranted by the constitution, upon military necessity--I invoke the
considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favour of Almighty
God.</p></q>

<p>The proclamation is countersigned by Mr. Seward. Of the Virginian
counties mentioned by name therein, only one, Berkeley, is on the
Potomac. The others are on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, or at
the mouth of the James River. The State of Tennessee, although a
seceded State, is not touched by this proclamation.</p><pb n="59"/>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Its Reception.</hi></p>

<p>The Federal Generals in the South seem to interpret the
proclamation each according to his own bias. Thus, General Saxton, the
Military Governor, at Port Royal, South Carolina, has issued a
proclamation to the negroes in his department stating that it is their
duty to carry the news of their freedom to their brethren still in
slavery. On the other hand, General Banks, who has superseded General
Butler at New Orleans, has addressed the people of Louisiana,
informing them "that the changes suggested therein" do not take effect
on the 1st of January, nor at any precise period.  No public
demonstration will be allowed, and the slaves are advised to remain on
their plantations "until their privileges shall have been definitively
established." No man will be allowed to take the law into his own
hands. Coloured soldiers are to be put under surveillance, and neither
allowed to make nor receive visits. No fugitives are to be returned to
their masters, but no encouragement is to be given to the slaves to
leave their masters.</p>

<p>General Burnside's army has already received a number of fugitives,
and in Norfolk the freed men have celebrated the great event. They met
together on the last day of the old year and formed a procession of at
least 4000 persons. Headed by a band of music, they paraded through
the principal streets of the city. They carried several Union flags,
and cheered loudly for emancipation.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The army of the Potomac is still inactive.</p>
<p>On the last day of the old year a battle commenced between General
Rosencranz's army and that commanded by Generals Joseph Johnston and
Bragg. The battle took place near Murfreesboro', in Tennessee. It
lasted two days, and at the close the Confederates still held their
intrenched positions within which they had been driven on the first
day's fight. The losses on both sides are heavy. Three Federal
Generals were wounded, and the Confederate Generals Cheatham and Rains
were killed. It is supposed that the attack will be renewed. We have
none but Federal reports of this battle.</p>

<p>The Richmond papers say that the Federals attacked Vicksburg on the
27th, 28th, and 29th ult., and were repulsed each time.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>The Richmond <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> contains a violent article upon England for
refusing to co-operate with Napoleon's mediation project. It says,
"England could have made fast friends with the South, but that time
has now gone by for ever."</p>

<p>General Banks has superseded General Butler at New Orleans. The
latter has been recalled to Washington at the instance of the French
Government. General Butler publishes an address to the people of New
Orleans defending his proceedings by reference to severities practised
by British and French Generals in the last three centuries.  He
alludes to Great Britain and France "as the most polished and the most
hypocritical nations of Europe," and boasts that, though he may be
cursed in the salon, he will be blessed in the cottage.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>The President has signed the bill admitting Western Virginia as a
separate State.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith of Indiana, Secretary of the Interior, and
member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has resigned his office, presumably
because of his disapproval of the emancipation policy.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions to the
effect that the war made upon American commerce by the Alabama is not
rebuked by the British press, nor the fitting out of vessels stopped
by the British Government, and that American merchants in the rise of
freights are subject, to a certain extent, to the evils which would
attend a state of war with England, while England enjoys the
advantages of a neutral.  A committee was appointed to report what
action the Chamber shall take in the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Horatio Seymour has been inaugurated Governor of New York. He
made a speech declaring that he would uphold the State Constitution
and see to it that the laws were respected; that his position gave him
little control over national events, but he hoped the Union would be
one and indivisible before his term of service expired. His first act
was to order the trial of the New York Police Commissioners and
Superintendent Kennedy, for permitting the use of the New York Police
Station for the illegal detention of citizens.</p>

<p>The Governor of Missouri, in his annual message, has recommended
the passage of an act providing for the gradual abolition of slavery
in that State, with the pecuniary aid of the Federal Government. The
State Legislature is strongly in favour of carrying out the same
policy, the only difference being whether the Governor's plan is
sufficiently speedy in its operation.</p>

<p>Captain Wynn, of the British Army, had been arrested in Baltimore,
on his arrival from Richmond, on the charge of acting as an emissary
of the Confederates. His companion, another British officer, was not
interfered with.</p>

<p>The Great Eastern was to have left New York for England on the 3rd,
but, in consequence of a heavy fog, the pilot advised that she should
be delayed until the weather cleared up.</p>

<p>A dispatch from St. Paul, Minnesota, states that thirty-eight
Indians, condemned for taking part in the massacre, were hung, at
Mankato, on the morning after Christmas Day, and that the gallows was
so constructed that all fell at once.</p></div2>

<p>The Alabama had played a bold trick. On the 7th of December she
intercepted the New York and Aspinwall steamer Ariel, off the east end
of Cuba, and took from her 9000 dols. The Ariel was then allowed to
proceed on bonds for 228,000 being given, payable thirty days after
the recognition of the Southern Confederacy. The result of this
proceeding was that on the return voyage the Ariel did not bring the
specie from Aspinwall, and the Federal Government had sent a
war-steamer to fetch it. The West India mail brings us further
intelligence of the doings of the Alabama. Captain Semmes had captured
an American barque, laden with provisions, and after having taken on
board his own ship so much of her cargo as he deemed necessary, he set
fire to the vessel. He had also seized a Federal schooner, but as her
cargo was the property of British subjects she was allowed to proceed
upon the Captain signing a bond to pay a certain sum of money to the
Confederate Government at the close of the war.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The Career of the Alabama.</hi>--(To the
Editor.)--Will you grant me space to correct a few of the many errors
contained in Mr. S. M. Underhill's communication to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>
referring to the Confederate steamer Alabama, a copy of which appeared
in your columns on Saturday last? 1. She was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> built under contract
with a Mr. Butcher. 2. Her engines are not by Penn, of London, but by
Laird, of Birkenhead. 3. She did not, after leaving Birkenhead, steam
directly to the island to the Atlantic, &amp;c., but passed a day and two
nights in Moelfra Bay, on the coast of Wales, taking in there a
portion of her crew, bonded stores, &amp;c. 4. Her destination was not
"Tarissa," wherever that may be, but Terceria, one of the
Azores. 5. She was never commanded by a Captain Bullock. The gentleman
who took charge of her from the time she left the stocks till she was
delivered into the hands of Captain Semmes, of the Confederate navy,
was Captain M. J. Butcher, R.N.R.  6. The Alabama had no English papers
to prove her neutrality; in fact, she carried no papers
whatever. 7. She was not visited daily by large parties of the
inhabitants of "Tarissa," or Terceria. Once only (on the 22nd of
August) a a party of about seventy persons, chiefly officials, paid
the vessel a visit.--A.B., Hull, Jan. 12, 1863.</p></div2>

<p>Had the proclamation with which the President of the Northern
States of America has inaugurated the New Year been issued under other
circumstances than those which unhappily attend it, there is not a
journal in the United Kingdom but would have given that document the
place of honour, and have introduced it with the warmest words of
congratulation, the most honest utterances of rejoicing, which it is
permitted to the pen to express. The President has proclaimed instant
freedom to the American slaves would have been an announcement to set
all hearts beating joyfully, and to call out a long exulting shout
from British freemen. We should have set our bells ringing, and have
kindled our fires.</p>
<q><p rend="center">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to
Milford Bay.</p></q>

<p>For, let a few calumniators write as they will, the people of
England have ever been of one mind upon the slavery question. They are
as stanch and resolved in their hatred of the domestic institution as
when we abolished the accursed slave traffic; as when, at a vast
sacrifice, both of money and of colonial prosperity, we struck the
last fetter from the last English slave; as when the women of England,
half a million strong, sent out a generous if not a wise remonstrance
to the women of America. We detest the system, and every attempt to
palliate its wickedness or to defend those who are its friends by any
argument based on principle is offensive to the right-thinking people
of this country. We repeat that, had this proclamation been issued in
time of peace and as the deliberate resolve of the Government of the
United States, the day on which we write, or some day that would have
been instantly and gleefully fixed, would have been kept as high
holiday in England, and the next mail would have gone out heavily
laden with our sincerest congratulations to our American brethren upon
their having given the deathblow to a cruel and blasphemous
system. Our churches would have<pb n="63"/> resounded with thanksgivings of a
still higher kind, and we should have rendered grateful homage to
Providence for having strengthened a kindred nation to wipe away a
stain upon humanity.</p>

<p>Even as it is, and in spite of the fact that for all practical
purposes the proclamation is a sham, the words cannot be read without
emotion. The President decrees freedom to the slaves in ten
States. But the more we should have rejoiced had the measure been one
of peaceful civilisation the more bitter is the feeling that the
document was prompted only for the embarrassment of an enemy, and that
it will be in most instances a <hi rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi>, while perhaps in others
it may bring on melancholy results. It is not the Government of
America that issues this proclamation, but the chief of certain States
that are seeking empire over others. The document is no noble State
paper, the crowning of a deliberate and generous policy, but an
experiment designed to help on a disastrous and unjustifiable war. It
is simply an attempt to explode a mine under the feet of those upon
whom cannon have thundered in vain. The President of the North, if he
believes that his proclamation will take effect, is in the position of
a soldier who employs some new and barbarous method of exterminating
his antagonists. Could the notification really effect what some of the
Abolitionists profess to desire, the savages who poison wells, the
miscreants who leave poisoned stores behind them, are humane and
civilised enemies in comparison to these who sign and publish this
document. But we will not believe that the Abolitionist doctrine is
that of Mr. Lincoln, who has always been accounted a kindly, if coarse
and shortsighted, man. He does not think that his notice that the
slaves are free will set four millions of revengeful Africans firing,
plundering, and slaying; but he probably does hope that he will
embarrass the Confederate Generals; and, moreover, he has obeyed the
dictates of the powerful faction that has hitherto made him its tool,
to the eternal detriment of the once mighty Republic which he was
elected to govern.</p>

<p>Yet it is impossible not to feel a great and a new anxiety while we
await information as to the results of this step. The President, true
to his feeble character, hesitated to the last, and did not issue the
proclamation until the second of the month. That the Confederates knew
that it had been finally resolved upon may be assumed as certain, and
it is equally so that they will have taken the most determined means
to meet it. Indeed, the counter-proclamation of President Davis,
though ostensibly and mainly directed against a man who had been
recalled before the Southern document was issued, is intended as a
repressive agency. Mr. Lincoln tells the slave that he is free, and
that he may take arms for what is curiously called his country;
Mr. Davis tells him that if he is taken in arms the officers under
whom he serves shall be liable to suffer death, and that he himself
shall be handed over to the tender mercies of the State to which he
belongs; and the slave knows what that means, and would, if captured,
gladly compound for the more merciful doom decreed to his white
officer. All this is truly horrible, and even if none of the fearful
revenge thus menaced shall be taken, America will be glad hereafter to
tear from her history the pages in which such documents are
preserved--to destroy such evidences that the boasted advance of
education and civilisation had done so little for her nations that
they had recourse in war time to menaces of indiscriminate
massacre. But we doubt not that the President of the Southern States
has done more than issue this proclamation. He has caused it to be
understood wherever there is a negro who can carry arms. The Lincoln
proclamation will have been kept out of the Slave States as much as
possible, but Mr. Davis will not rely upon any such precaution. He
knows that the Abolitionists are active and skilful, that they have a
complex "underground" agency in the South, and that they will use
every effort to make the negroes aware of the Washington manifesto. It
will he impossible to prevent its coming to the knowledge of thousands
of slaves. But we mistake the stern character of the Confederate
authorities if they have not made preparations for dealing in the most
terrible manner with the first Africans who may take advantage of
Mr. Lincoln's verbal enfranchisement of the race. The Abolitionist may
have cause to shudder at the example that will be made of those whom
they have excited into an attempt to defy soldiers flushed, with four
great victories over the North.</p>

<p>But, on consideration, we are inclined to retain our conviction
which is, in all probability, Mr. Lincoln's (we hope so)--that if the
slaves were to be moved by his documents they would have been moved
much sooner. They showed no signs of insurrection, so far as we know,
when their masters were weak; they now know that their masters are
strong and victorious, and it is improbable that the black man's
inclination to rise will be increased by the news which he has been
receiving for the last year. Still, there may be some slaves who may
believe that their hour has come; and if there are, whether they are
victors or vanquished, such things will be done as will make even the
Abolitionists shudder. Regarded, therefore, at the very best--that is,
as a mere sacrifice to the petulance of a faction--this proclamation is
contemptible; but if we look at it in another light, and believe that
it is intended to do what the sword failed to accomplish, we dare
hardly trust ourselves with expressions that would fittingly signify
our sense of the wickedness.</p></div2>

George Washington, with the numeral "5," on either side, and the
initials "U.S." beneath. Within an elaborately-executed border, the
following inscription appeared:--"Postage currency.  Furnished only by
the assistant-treasurers and designated depositories of the United

"wild-cat" notes emitted in the various American crises, and our own
tradesman's tokens, one-pound notes.  Likewise did a certain Russian
rouble note present itself to our memory--a note given us in change by
an hotel-keeper, and so greasy, or rotten, and so tattered that it was
ensconced in a pasteboard frame for safety.  After all, we thought,
"money is money;" and so long as the Federal Government forbears to
apply the sponge to its obligations a pocketbook full of these little

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">To</hi> the account of this great battle, from
a Federal point of view, already given in this Journal, we add a
description of it taken from a Confederate standpoint.  The Southern
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> sends from General Lee's head-quarters the
following particulars of the Battle of Fredericksburg:--</p>

<q><p>The morning of the 13th of December--a memorable day to the
historian of the Decline and Fall of the American Republic--broke
still and warm, while, as on the preceding day, a thick haze enveloped
the town of Fredericksburg and the circumjacent valley, and delayed
the opening of the fire by the antagonistic batteries until the sun
had been up for some three hours.  It was strange to contrast
Saturday, the 13th of September, with Saturday, the 6th, and to
compare the intense cold of the earlier Saturday with the spring-like
warmth and calmness of the later.  The day which I am describing was
one of those outbursts of that Indian summer which lingers long and
fondly in beautiful Virginia; the morning haze which shrouded heath,
and plain, and forest, was the ordinary prelude to the warmth and glow
of the sun at noonday.  As the fog lifted about ten in the morning,
and the sun burst through the clouds, the long lines of the Federal
Army, which had passed the whole preceding day in deploying and
preparing for the attack, were distinctly visible in the plain, and
gave awful indications of the amount of the Federal host which had
crossed the river.  The Confederate army, wholly undaunted by the
extravagant stories about the strength of their foe, waited calmly,
drawn up for the most part within the fringe of the woods, confident
in their position and in the valour which has never failed them.  And
here it may be as well finally to dispel those illusions under which
it is the custom of the Northern press to veil the disgrace of defeat,
when the fact itself admits of no denial.  The whole number of
Confederates in the field this day did not exceed from 80,000 to
90,000 men.  Of these, some 25,000 men, taking the very highest
estimate, took part in the fight.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the positions of each of the
numerous Confederate batteries which stretched along the length of
their six-mile line of battle.  It will suffice if I indicate the
batteries which were most hotly engaged, and bore the brunt of the
action.  By far the most important position was occupied by the
Washington Artillery, commanded by Colonel Walton, of New Orleans, and
posted on the heights in the immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg
not more than 400 yards from the town.  These heights, which are
precisely of that altitude which is most favourable for the play of
artillery, are surmounted by a brick house, now riddled by round
shot, belongings to Mr. Marye, and are commonly called Marye's
Heights.  At their base a road winds, protected on one side by the
hills and on the other by a solid stone wall, about four feet in
height, over which a brigade of Confederates, themselves perfectly
sheltered, poured the deadliest and most effective of fires.  A little
further back, to the south-east of Marye's Heights, stands another and
higher hill, from which the most commanding view of the entire fields
is obtainable, and which, as it is the usual station of the
Commander-in-Chief, is now known as General Lee's hill. From this
hill during a large portion of Saturday a 30-pounder Parrott gun, cast
at the Tredegar Works, in Richmond, poured a destructive fire into the
Federals.  Suddenly, about three in the afternoon, on its
thirty-seventh discharge, this gun burst with a dreadful explosion,
but happily did no injury to any of the bystanders.  At the moment of
its explosion Captain Phillips, of the Grenadier Guards (favourably
remarked this day for his behaviour under fire), Major Venables, of
General Lee's Staff, and Major Haskell were conversing within a few
feet of the gun.  Their escape without injury was a little less than
miraculous.  As the Confederate line trends away to the right, the
batteries of General Hood's division were actively engaged against the
advancing columns of the Pennsylvanians; but next to the batteries on
Marye's Heights and General Lee's hill  I should say that the
artillery commanded by Colonel Walker took the most effective part in
the action, as it poured a flanking fire into the enemy's left.  One
other battery deserved a favourable mention, which it obtained in the
short and modest report of the battle which emanates from the pen of
General Lee.  On the extreme right of the Confederates, in front of the
position occupied by General Stuart's cavalry, a few batteries of
Stuart's Horse Artillery were thrown forward, to flank the Federals,
between Walker's Artillery and the river.  General Stuart ordered
Major John Pelham, his Chief of Artillery, to advance one gun
considerably towards the enemy, and to open upon him.  Major Pelham
obeyed, and opened the fire of a 12-pound Napoleon gun with great
precision and deadly effect into the Federal flank.  The galling
discharges of this gun quickly drew upon it the fire of the three
Federal field batteries, while from across the river, two other heavy
batteries joined in the strife and made Major Pelham and his gun their
target.  For hours not less than thirty Federal cannon strove to
silence Major Pelham's popgun, and strove in vain.  The unyielding and
undemonstrative courage of Major Pelham, his composure under the
deadliest fire, have long made him conspicuous, but never were his
noble qualities subject of more glowing eulogy than upon this
occasion.  General Lee exclaimed , "It is inspiriting to see such
glorious courage in one so young."  (Major Pelham is not more than
twenty-two); General Jackson remarked, "With a Pelham upon either
flank I could vanquish the world."</p>

<p>At half-past eight a.m. General Lee, accompanied by his full Staff,
rode slowly along the front of the Confederate lines from the left to
right, and took up his station for a time beyond Hamilton's Crossing,
and in the rear of the batteries on the extreme Confederate right.  It
would be presumptuous in me to say one word in commendation of the
serenity, or, if I may so express it, the unconscious dignity of
General Lee's courage when he is under fire.  No one who sees and
knows his demeanour in ordinary life would expect anything else from
one so calm, so undemonstrative, and unassuming.  But the description
applied after the battle of Alma to Lord Raglan by Marshal
St. Arnaud, and in which, noticing Lord Raglan's unconsciousness
under fire, he speaks of his "antique heroism," seems to me so
applicable to General Lee that I cannot forbear recalling it here.  At
a subsequent period of the day General Lee assumed his station on the
hill which takes its name from him, and thence, in company with
General Longstreet, calmly watched the repulse of the repeated Federal
efforts against the heights on which he stood.  Occasionally General
Jackson rode up to the spot and mingled in conversation with the
other two leading Generals.  Once General Longstreet exclained to him,
"Are you not scared by that file of Yankees you have before you down
there?" to which General Jackson replied, "Wait till they come a
little nearer, and they shall either scare me or I'll scare them."</p>

<p>The battle opened when the sun had let in enough light through the
mist to disclose the near proximity of the Federal lines and field
batteries.  The first shot was fired shortly before ten a.m. from the
batteries in the Federal centre, and was directed against General
Hood's division.  The Pennsylvanian Reserves advanced boldly under a
heavy fire against the Confederates, who occupied one of the copsewood
spurs, and were for a time permitted to hold it, but presently the
Confederate batteries opened on them, and a determined charge of the
Texans drove the Yankees out of the wood in a confusion from which
nothing could subsequently rally them.  Simultaneously a heavy fire
issued from the batteries of General A. P. Hill's and General Early's
divisions, which was vigorously replied to by the Federal field
batteries.  The only advantage momentarily gained by the Federals in
this quarter, and which is noticed in General Lee's report, was on the
occasion of the collapse of a regiment of North Carolina conscripts,
who broke and ran, but whose place was rapidly taken by more intrepid
successors.  The cannonading now became general along the entire line.
Such a scene, at once terrific and sublime, mortal eye never rested on
before, unless the bombardment of Sebastopol by the combined batteries
of France and England revealed a more fearful manifestation of the
hate and fury of man.  The thundering, bellowing roar of hundreds of
pieces of artillery, the bright jets of issuing flame--the screaming,
hissing, whistling, shrieking projectiles--<pb n="81"/>the wreaths of smoke, as
shell after shell burst into the still air, the savage cash of
roundshot among the trees of the shattered forest, formed a scene
likely to sink for ever into the memory of all who witnessed it, but
utterly defying verbal delineation. A direct and enfilading fire swept
each battery upon either side as it was unmasked, volley replied to
volley, crash succeeded crash, until the eye lost all power of
distinguishing the lines of combatants, and the whole plain seemed a
lake of fire, a seething mass of molten lava, coursed over by
incarnate fiends drunk with fury and revenge.</p>

<p>Twice the Federals, gallantly led and encouraged by their officers,
dashed against the forces of General A. P. Hill and General Early, and
twice they recoiled, broken and discomfited, and incapable of being
again rallied to the fray. The eager Confederates drove them with
horrid carnage a mile across the plain, and only desisted from the
pursuit when they came under the fire of the Federal batteries across
the river. Upon the extreme Confederate right General Stuart's Horse
Artillery pressed hotly upon the fugitives, and kept up a fire,
subsequently understood to have been very effective, until after
dark. Upon the Confederate right, where the antagonists fought upon
more level terms, the equality of loss upon both sides was greater
than on the Confederate left; but even here the Federal loss in
officers and men far outnumbered that of their opponents. General
Bayard, the best cavalry officer in the Federal service, fell dead
almost on the eve of the day which was to have witnessed his
nuptials. General Jackson, of Pennsylvania, shared his fate. Many
other general officers were carried to the Federal rear grievously
wounded; whereas of the Confederates only one officer of rank--General
Gregg--fell upon the right, and only one--General Cobb--upon the
left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the battle which had dashed furiously against the lines
of Generals Hood, A. P. Hill, and Early, was little more than child's
play as compared with the onslaught directed by the Federals in the
immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg. The impression that the
Confederate batteries would not fire heavily upon the Federals
advancing in this quarter, for fear of injuring the town of
Fredericksburg, is believed to have prevailed among the Northern
Generals. How bitterly they deceived themselves subsequent events
served to show. To the Irish division, commanded by General Meagher,
was principally committed the desperate task of bursting out of the
town of Fredericksburg and forming, under the withering fire of the
Confederate batteries, to attack Marye's Heights, lowering immediately
in their front. Never at Fontenoy, at Albuera, or at Waterloo was more
undoubted courage displayed by the sons of Erin than during these six
frantic dashes which they directed against the almost impregnable
position of their foe.</p>

<p>That any mortal men could have carried the position before which
they were wantonly sacrificed, defended as it was, it seems to me idle
for a moment to believe; but the bodies which lie in dense masses
within forty yards of the muzzles of Colonel Walton's guns are the
best evidence what manner of men they were who pressed on to death
with the dauntlessness of a race which has gained glory on a thousand
battlefields, and never more richly deserved it than at the foot of
Marye's Heights on the 13th day of December, 1862.</p>

<p>An opportunity of sending this letter, with an encouraging
prospect of its reaching England, compels me to defer a further
account of the gallant defence on the Confederate left of the town, of
Fredericksburg and of the battlefield until a subsequent letter.</p></q></div2>

<p>The struggle before Murfreesboro', in Tennessee, ended--after a
five days' struggle and severe slaughter on both sides--in the retreat
of<pb n="87"/> the Confederates, during the night of the 3rd inst., to
Sullahoma, thirty miles distant, on the line of the Nashville and
Chattanooga Railway. The Federal General Rosencranz has occupied
Murfreesboro', but was not able to pursue General Bragg's army, which
retired in good order. The Federals acknowledge a loss of 1000 killed
and 5500 wounded--of several thousand prisoners and 23 pieces of
artillery. Generals Willich and Fry are among the prisoners. The
Confederate loss is estimated at 4500 killed and wounded and 1000
prisoners. Twenty negro teamsters, surprised in the rear of the Federal
array by the Confederate cavalry, were immediately shot by their
captors.</p>

<p>Five thousand Federal cavalry have made a raid from Kentucky into
East Tennessee, and destroyed nine miles of the East Tennessee and
Virginia Railroad, near Knoxville, thus preventing reinforcements from
Richmond reaching General Bragg.</p>

<p>Despatches from General Grant to General Halleck report that
General Sullivan defeated the Confederates under General Forrest, at
Lexington, Tennessee, on the 1st inst., capturing six cannons and many
prisoners. The Confederate loss in killed and wounded is put down at
1400 men, and that of the Federals at 800.</p>

<p>General Sherman invested Vicksburg, in the Lower Mississippi, with
40,000 men, Commodore Farragut's gun-boats co-operating. The fighting
lasted five days, with varying success. The Federals fought their way
to within two miles of the city, capturing three lines of works, when
they were assailed by fresh forces under General Joe Johnston. After a
hand-to-hand fight, the Federals were driven back to their first line
of defence, with the loss of General Morgan and 3000 men. The
Confederates have concentrated their forces from Jackson and Grenada
at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The celebrated iron-clad Monitor, the first-born of Mr. Ericsson's
military genius, sprang a leak, while off Cape Hatteras, on the 31st.,
and sank. The Monitor was being towed by the steamer Rhode Island,
which succeeded in saving a portion of the officers and crew. Five
officers and nineteen men belonging to the two vessels were lost. One
theory of her loss is that the sea rushed down her turret.</p>

<p>At New Orleans General Banks had released 112 State prisoners
sentenced by General Butler. He had also issued an order permitting
the clergy of New Orleans to resume their functions under certain
restrictions.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the officers of the Kentucky regiments had
sent in their resignations in consequence of the issue of
Mr. Lincoln's latest proclamation. The volunteers from this State
share the sentiments of their officers.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>General Halleck has rescinded the order of General Grant excluding
all Jews from his department.</p>

<p>General Butler had arrived at Washington, and dined with
Mr. Seward. He was also the object of a popular manifestation in his
favour at the National Hotel.</p>

<p>The large hall of the Cooper Institute, New York, was crowded on
the 5th inst. to its fullest capacity by an audience of white and
coloured people of both sexes to celebrate the Emancipation
Proclamation. Representatives of the European, African, and mulatto
races occupied the platform. Speeches were made by the
Rev. Dr. Cheever, Lewis Tappan, and the Rev. Mr. Denison of the white
race; and by the Rev. H. H. Garnet, the Rev. J.S. Raymond, Professor
W. J. Brown, the Rev. Mr. Kane, and other speakers of the African or
mixed races.</p>

<p>The returns of the annual immigration at the port of New York show
that the number of immigrants was 76,000, or 15,000 more than in
1861. The German immigration exceeded the Irish in 1862. That from
England follows third.</p>

<p>Owing chiefly to the astonishing and sudden development of the
American grain trade with Europe, 1862 was a peculiarly favourable
year to the interests of American railroads and canals. The New York
canals, which only earned 900,000 dols. surplus revenues in 1858, paid
over to the State which owns them 4,000 000 dols. in 1862. The
principal lines of railroad have paid higher dividends than during the
former years of peace. Some of them, as the New York and Erie, and
Illinois Central railroads, which either never paid, or long since
ceased to pay, dividends, commenced to pay them in 1862.</p>

<p>Gold has risen to 36 per cent premium.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Governor Seymour's
Message.</hi></p>

<p>The message of the newly-elected Democratic Governor of the State
of New York was delivered to the Legislature on the 7th. He says, when
commenting on national affairs:--</p>
<q><p>The truths of the financial and military situation must not be
kept back.  There must be no attempt to put down free expression of
public opinion. Affrighted at the ruin they have wrought, the authors
of our calamities, North and South, insist that it was caused by an
unavoidable contest about slavery. This has been the subject, not the
cause, of the controversy. We are to look for the causes of the war in
the pervading disregard of obligations of laws and constitutions, in
disrespect for constituted authority; above all, in the local
prejudices which have grown up in the two portions of the Atlantic
States at the two extremes of our country. There is no honest
statement of our difficulties which does not teach that our people
must reform themselves as well as the conduct of the Government and
the policy of our rulers. It is not too late to save the country if we
will enter upon our sacred duty in a right spirit and in the right
way. When we do, the effect will be soon felt throughout the land and
by the civilised world. We shall then strengthen the Government,
weaken the rebellion, and unite our people; and the world will
recognise our capacity for self-government when we show that we are
capable of self reform.</p></q>
<p>The Governor condemns the exercise of martial power as destructive
of the rights of States and of the judicial and legislative powers of
the general Government. He declares the President's proclamation to
be</p>

<q><p>Impolitic, unjust, and unconstitutional; calculated to raise
many barriers to the restoration of the Union; likely to be
misconstrued by the world as an abandonment of the hope of restoring
it--a result to which New York is nobly opposed, and which will be
effectually resisted. The Union will be restored by the Central and
Western States, both free and slave, who are exempt from the violent
passions which bear control at the extremes. Those central Slave
States which rejected the ordinance of secession, which sought to
remain in the Union, and which were driven away by a contemptuous and
uncompromising policy, must be brought back. The National
Constitution must be held inviolate, and the rights of States must be
respected as not less sacred. A consolidated Government would destroy
the home rights and liberties of the people. The suppression of
journals and the imprisonment of persons have been glaringly
partisan.</p></q>

<p>The Governor contends that though the seceded States may have
forfeited their right to appeal to the Constitution, not a single
right of the people of the loyal States can be suspended. He denies
that the civil war in the South takes away from the people of the
loyal North the benefits of one principle of civil liberty. He
promises support to the armies in the field, and obedience to all the
constitutional demands of the general Government. Under no
circumstances can the division of the Union be conceded.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Whatever</hi> may be the strategic value of the
recent operations in America, there can be no doubt that they will
have moral weight, and we could almost wish that the success of the
Federals had been more marked, inasmuch as there might then be more
hope of their being brought to relinquish a useless and hopeless
war. It might be too much to expect that a high spirited people,
accustomed to vaunt its superiority over Creation generally, would be
inclined to listen to any terms for pacification while four
unmistakable defeats were unbalanced by any proof that the North could
fight well. Though we believe that nearly all except professional
politicians and others, whose profits lie in the continuance of the
struggle, have ceased to speak of the reconstruction of the Union as
one of the objects of the war, we have no right to blame the dogged
obstinacy with which the Federals insist on going on with it until
they can find opportunity for a decorous "rest in the accounts."
Nobody likes to be completely defeated, and many a man who has
privately made up his mind that he is so will cling to his adversary,
and struggle, and wrangle, rather than accept the situation. A small
success will often serve him as an excuse for retiring, flushed and
angry, and declaring that he should have gained the day but for a
chain of accidents which took the strife out of the lists of fair
play. We have no right to expect the Americans to rise superior to
human nature; nobody but themselves ever supposed them at such a moral
altitude, and Englishmen have been ready to make every allowance for
exacerbated and discomfited men. But this Murfreesboro' business,
although we lack accurate details of it, has shown that the Federals,
if decently led, can fight as well as their antagonists, and can
almost gain a victory. The battle was protracted and sanguinary; but,
let the Confederates make the very best of it, they had to abandon the
field. The affair must count on the Federal side; and we repeat that
we are inclined to hope that this will be placed beyond dispute by the
despatches, because mediation might then address itself to the victors
with a good chance of being listened to with something<pb n="91"/> more than
tolerance. We should like to be able to say to the North that it had
at length vindicated its military character, and might now be expected
to show that it was governed by reason, and was prepared to abandon an
attempt at impossible coercion.</p>

<p>We do not for a moment contend that the time has come for England
to say this. Our Government may or may not be more inclined than
heretofore to reconsider the situation, but it is impossible to say,
just now, what our Government thinks. Mr. Gladstone has said his say
upon the American question, and believes that the South is a nation;
while his colleague, Mr. Milner Gibson, assures his constituents that
the North is winning, because it occupies more territory than it did
in the earlier stage of secession. We may hear a third voice, of more
potency, in the course of the next three weeks; but, on the whole, it
would seem that the Premier does not believe that the time has come
for any general European demonstration against the continuance of the
war.</p>

<p>But we must call attention to another phase of the question. It is
one which the journalist has watched for some time, and it is
creditable to the reticence and discretion of the British press that
no irritating use has been made of the facts. There can, however, be
no object now in disguising the truth, which is, that France has
become an object of both dislike and apprehension on the part of the
Federals. It is not many months since such a state of things would
have seemed impossible. It had ever been the habit with the Americans
to speak of the French as the most advanced nation of the Old World,
to heap adulation upon the wisdom of the Emperor Napoleon, and to
profess a sort of belief that one day France and the Republic might,
in union, direct the destinies of the world. It is not now worth
inquiring how far these sentiments were dictated by what Sir Philip
Francis calls the only excuse for flattery--namely, the <hi rend="italic">odium
tertii</hi>. Whether England was the third party who was so hateful that it
was pleasant to flatter her supposed enemy, is now beside the
question. The case was so, and the Emperor had a right to believe that
his influence was very powerful in the North. It is gone, and the
Emperor knows that it is gone, and does not trouble himself to
disguise that knowledge. The journals of the North have for some time
been full of taunts and sneers at the Tuileries, and these expressions
of feeling have lately deepened into downright abuse, and even
menace. The Emperor is told that he is "found out," and is warned that
it is not for a despot (the discovery of whose despotism is curiously
coincident with the establishment of another) to interfere with the
will of a great and free nation. He is told that his attempt at
drawing England into a joint mediation was an "insolence," and England
herself is actually praised for having been too "deep" for the Sphinx
of Paris. He is further assured that, shou1d he presume to interfere
further, and especially should he give the slightest sign of using
other than moral force, he will be suddenly confronted by a tremendous
coalition. As the constituents of this coalition might not be easily
guessed, we had better say that it is to consist of Russia, England,
Spain, and the Federals, and that it is to replace upon the throne of
France the house whose Princes fought so nobly for Republican
institutions. We are simply reproducing the languages of various
Northern papers, and those who are unfortunately obliged to peruse
such publications will testify to the accuracy of our statements.</p>

<p>The Emperor of the French does not appear to be very much terrified
by this fearful programme, or, if he is, he continues to practise the
art of veiling his alarms. He continues to treat mediation as a thing
to be attempted again as soon as opportunity shall serve; but, without
insisting too much upon this, he orders the publication of a document
in which he distinctly enunciates his intention of opposing the force
of France to what is not very properly called the Monroe doctrine. The
despatch to General Forey is about as significant a document as need
be, and it lays down as part of the Imperial policy a resolve to
repress American ascendency in America.  And, as Sir Walter Scott says
of another Louis of France, "he is just the man to give a lively
colour to his avowal by following it up by an execution." The Mexican
expedition, largely reinforced, is going to work in thorough earnest;
the capital is to be seized at all cost; and perhaps the occupation of
Rome may be paralleled by an occupation of Mexico that will "protect"
the throne of the Incas against all comers, especially such as come
from any part of the American Continent. The gauntlet is fairly flung
to all who cry "America for the Americans;" and it may be an
additional reason against an attempt to reconstitute the Union that
the first step of the new State must in honour be an armed protest
against French action, or the swagger of twenty years is even more
vain than it was believed to be.</p>

<p>In noting the history of the war, therefore, we may observe that it
has called into existence a new element of opposition to the extension
of American "Empire;" and, although at the present moment this may not
seem so important a fact as it is, the fact will be a very grave one
when the time comes, as come it must, for settling by treaty the
principle of the Partition of America. Into how many portions the vast
continent will be divided it is now impossible to say, but it is quite
clear that France proposes to erect barriers against the unity of the
continent.</p></div2>

<p>And so the far-famed Monitor has gone to the bad! But a few months
have passed since the <hi rend="smallcap">Illustrated London News</hi>
contained an Engraving of the momentous fight in Hampton Roads,
depicting both the Merrimac and the Monitor--the ironclad that
destroyed a fleet, and the ironclad that saved one. And now, of the
two monsters of the deep--the Federal and Confederate Kilkenny
cats--not so much as a tail, by way of vestige, remains. The Merrimac,
indeed, committed suicide; but the Monitor was the victim of sudden
death. An aqueous apoplexy overtook her off Cape Hatteras; she sprang
a leak; pumps were in vain; she became waterlogged, and went down like
a stone. We are reminded of the warrior clad in Milan steel, who, as
Guicciardini tells us, in one of the Italian civil wars of the middle
ages, was ingulfed, horse, iron panoply and all, by mere force of
gravitation, in a morass, and was the only man killed in the
particular battle in question. There was an English Earl of Sandwich,
too, Admiral and General at Sea, who, venturing in a small boat during
a naval engagement, was drowned by the weight of his armour.</p>
 
<p>Old tars of the Benbow school, nay, old landsmen, amateurs of Dibdin's songs,
and believers in the sole efficacy of wooden walls, will doubtless rub
their hands and chuckle at the catastrophes which have overtaken the
two model ironclads of America. The "floating flat-irons," the "hogs
in armour," have certainly come to signal grief. Ay, but they were not
constructed on the lines of the Warrior or the Gloire; and if the
American wise men of Gotham will go to sea in a bowl covered with
railway iron, they must expect dangerous squalls. Once upon a time, we
saw the late Mr. Tom Barry, clown at Astley's, floating on the bosom
of the Thames in a washing-tub drawn by two geese; but the pantomimic
navigator would scarcely have ventured upon a trip to the Bay of
Biscay in his eccentric craft. After all, the science of naval
construction in metal is in its infancy, and will be liable to error
and mishap for some time to came. A gentleman calling upon Beau
Brummell one morning met his valet coming down stairs with an armful
of crumpled white neckclothes. "These are our failures, Sir," the
gentleman's gentleman explained, when interrogated. The Beau had only
spoilt a couple of dozen cravats before he found one to suit him. In
like manner armour-plating in naval architecture must, we suppose,
have its "failures" before the golden mean, or the iron one, is
found.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer City of Washington we have telegrams
from New York to the 17th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>There has been no movement on the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>The Federal Colonel Cheseret reports that he had posted the
emancipation proclamation on the walls of Winchester, Virginia, and
scattered it among the farms. The proclamation was depopulating the
region between the Rappahannock and the Potomac of the slaves owned
there.</p>

<p>General Hunter, formerly superseded for his Abolitionism, has been
appointed to the command of the Department of the South.</p>

<p>General Bragg has been superseded in the command of the Confederate
force in Tennessee by General Longstreet. The Confederates estimate
their loss at Murfreesboro' at 9000.</p>

<p>On their retreat, after the unsuccessful attack on Vicksburg, the
Federal gun-boats proceeded up the Arkansas River. On the 11th they
assailed Arkansas post, 100 miles up the stream. The post was defended
by 7000 men who, being attacked in front and rear, surrendered
unconditionally, after a short and sharp struggle and a loss of 550
killed and wounded. The Federal loss is reported at 200 killed and
wounded. General Sherman had been superseded by General M'Clernand,
who was about to proceed up the White River.</p>

<p>Despatches from Springfield, Missouri, state that the Confederates
were repulsed in their attack upon the town, and retired, leaving a
portion of their killed and wounded on the field.</p>

<p>Reports have been received of further depredations by the Alabama
in the West Indies. She captured two vessels in Mona Passage, one of
them, the Parker, of Boston, was destroyed; the other, the Union, from
Baltimore, was released. The cargo was not touched, being owned by
British subjects.</p>

<p>Galveston, the chief port of Texas, has been retaken by the
Confederate. On the 1st inst. five Confederate steamers, armed with
guns, protected by cotton bales, with troops on board, attacked the
Federal gun-boats and captured the gun-boat Harriet Lane. Her officers
and nearly all her crew had been killed by musketry. Two Federal
gun-boats escaped. The Federals blew up their flagship, Commodore
Renshaw accidentally perishing on board. The remainder of the Federal
fleet and troops returned to New Orleans. The Harriet Lane was
strongly armed, and will be a valuable acquisition to the nearly
extinct Confederate navy. The Confederates were commanded by General
Magruder. He claims to have taken about 600 prisoners, and valuable
stores, arms, &amp;c. Six Federal vessels have left New Orleans to
recapture the Harriet Lane and to destroy the Confederate gun-boats at
Bayou Buffalo, in Galveston Bay.</p>

<p>The Confederates are said to have executed ten Federal officers in
Arkansas, in retaliation for the acts of General M'Neil.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi> states that the Federal
officers captured at Murfreesboro' will be confined until General
Butler be given up to the Confederate Government.</p>

<p>The Louisiana State Capitol at B&#x00E2;ton Rouge has been burnt, with all
its contents. The perpetrators of this act of vandalism are
unknown.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>Twenty-six Republican members of the Senate, forming a clear
majority of that body, have presented a memorial to the President
expressing a want of confidence in the Administration. They assert
that the President is not aided by a Cabinet agreeing with him in
political principles and general policy, and urge him to such changes
as will secure a unity of purpose and action. They also admonish him
that it is unwise and unsafe to intrust any important military
operation to any officer who is not a cordial supporter of the
Government.</p><pb n="111"/>

<p>A bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives for the
enlistment of 150,000 negro troops. The resolution to lay the bill
upon the table was defeated by 83 to 53.</p>

<p>Mr. Spaulding, the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means in
the House of Representatives, has explained the financial situation of
the Government. He said that the Government needed immediately
150,000,000 dols. All the gold and silver in the banks of the loyal
States was 87,000,000 dols. Bonds could not be sold. 1,117,000,000
dols. were required, in addition to the receipts from the customs and
taxes, to carry on the Government until July, 1854. It is necessary to
borrow, in some form, 1,900,000 dols. every day, Sundays included,
between this time and the 1st of next July. Mr. Spaulding declared
that the only hope of success in financial schemes depended upon
military success. Congress has passed a bill for the issue of 100,000
000 dols. in legal-tender notes. The Missouri Emancipation Aid Bill,
which proposed an appropriation of 10,000,000 dols., has been reported
back by the Judiciary Committee, with a recommendation that it be
increased to 20,000,000 dols.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Mr. Davis's Message.</hi></p>

<p>President Davis's Message has been sent in to the Confederate
Congress. He complains that the European Powers declared neutrality
without acknowledging the sovereignty of the seceded States; thus
injuring the South, and prolonging the war by admitting the doctrine
that the Federal Government had a right to coerce the seceded
States. If these States were independent, the refusal to entertain the
same international intercourse with them as with the North was unjust,
no matter what may have been the motive prompting it. He does not
complain of any treaty being concluded between the United States and
Europe for the abolishment of privateering, although the prohibition
to either belligerent to dispose of its prize in European ports
operated with intense severity against the South, by depriving her of
the only means of maintaining, with some approach to equality, a
struggle on the ocean.</p>

<p>He declares the anxiety at the South for peace, but says that its
determination against submission is unalterable. He denounces the
conduct of the Union armies as atrocious and cruel. Referring to
Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, he says he may well leave it
to the instincts of the common humanity of men of all countries to
pass judgment upon a measure by which millions of human beings of
inferior race, peaceful and contented labourers in their sphere, are
doomed to extermination, while they are encouraged to commit
assassination by an insidious recommendation to abstain from violence
unless in self-defence. Commissioned Federal officers attempting to
execute the proclamation will, if captured, be delivered to the State
authorities laws for the to be dealt with according to the State laws
for the punishment of criminals exciting insurrection.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>General Butler has received a cordial reception in Boston, and
expounded his plan there for making France and England pay the
interest on the United States' national debt by means of an export
duty on cotton.</p>

<p>In several counties of Eastern Maryland the slaves, though not
affected by Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, refuse to work without
wages.</p>

<p>A Democratic United States' senator has been elected by the
Pennsylvanian Legislature by a majority of two votes over Mr. Cameron,
the ex-Secretary of War and Minister to Russia. In New Jersey the
Democratic Legislature have sent to the Federal Senate Colonel
J.W. Wall, who was sent to Fort Lafayette by Mr. Simon Cameron a few
months ago.</p>

<p>On the 10th inst. Dr. Lyman Beecher died in Brooklyn, at the
advanced age of eighty-seven years and three months. He left thirteen
children surviving him, of whom Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Dr. Edward Beecher, and Miss Catherine
Beecher are best known to fame. Forty years ago he took a prominent
part in combating the advance of Unitarianism in Massachusetts, and
was one of the ablest opponents of the late Dr. Channing.</p>

<p>Mr. George Francis Train has narrowly escaped being lynched at
Jonesville, Wisconsin. The telegram does not state the reason for this
manifestation of popular displeasure, but it probably arose from
Mr. Train's denunciation of the emancipation proclamation and the
negro race.</p>

<p>The premium on gold reached 50 on the 15th. On the 16th it had fallen to 47 &#x00BE;.</p>

honour of the occasion, which drew together a large concourse of
spectators from all parts of the State. The day was kept as a holiday
in Sacramento.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 31,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi> have to record another diplomatic
incident in the history of the American War. The Emperor of the French
has caused a despatch of importance to be sent by his Foreign Minister
to M. Mercier, who repesents France at Washington. It has been called
"officious" by the French journals, and it remains to be seen in which
of the two senses attaching to the word the Americans will interpret
the interference--"officious" implying, according to their own Noah
Webster, "kind and obliging," and also "intermeddling in affairs with
which one has no concern." Certainly, so far as externals go, there is
nothing in the despatch of M. Drouyn de Lhuys to offend the most
sensitive nation in the world. The Emperor does not offer mediation,
he does not even offer to interfere; but he dwells upon his friendship
for the United States--upon the pain he feels in witnessing the raging
war; declares that he takes all susceptibilities into account, and
merely makes suggestions for a negotiation. He does not ask that the
war may be discontinued while such negotiation is in progress. On the
contrary, he reminds the North that soldiers may go on fighting while
civilians are debating, and that the cessation of strife may be
contemporaneous with the adjustment of terms. But he urges that
conferences might be advantageously held between the belligerents,
who, instead of mutually accusing one another, might discuss the
questions which separate them. This, he represents, would involve no
humiliation, would exclude the idea of alien pressure of any hind, and
would simply be a practical investigation into reciprocal
grievances.</p>

<p>If the Emperor had to do anything, it is difficult to say that he
could have done less or put his points more graciously. There has not
been time to hear how the despatch (a copy of which was to be left
with Mr. Seward, if desired, according to usage) has been received in
America, and it is very hard to speculate upon the course which the
strangely-constituted mass called the American people will take upon
any given subject. The American organs here are uninstructed, and are
of course fumbling in the dark while compelled to say something; but,
not knowing what to say that may not be repudiated by the next mail,
their trumpets give a very uncertain sound, for they themselves know
not whether to blow the signal for battle. But, on the whole, it
appears to be thought that the proposal of the Emperor will be
declined, partly on a ground to which his Majesty himself adverts, and
partly on a plea which, obstinate and pedantic as it is, represents an
idea that is not altogether to be treated with disrespect. The ground
alluded to by the Emperor is the hope and belief of the North that it
is conquering the South, or will be able to do so. His Majesty is too
courteous to point out the futility of this notion, or to represent
that the North, having been beaten in nearly every important
engagement, and its armies at this moment recoiling from two
disastrous attempts upon the principal strongholds of the South, the
signs of the war cannot be read favourably for the Federals, even by
the most resolute of their prophets. He passes this by, and he also
abstains from dwelling upon the second difficulty. The North declares
the Confederates to be "rebels," and is enraged at Europe's
recognising them as belligerents; and as the doing this must be the
first step towards a pacific conference it does not seem very probable
that Mr. Lincoln or his Cabinet (two distinct agencies, as the
President is unceremoniously told by some of his subjects) will
venture upon a measure much more rational than popular. So that
although, as we have said, anything like prediction as to the course
of the American people would be very hazardous, there does not seem to
be any great likelihood of the olive-branch appearing in a French
hand.</p>

<p>We have also to hear what the South has to say. President Davis has
been again addressing his people, and his tone is, as usual, temperate
but resolute. He complains that the European Powers have refused to
recognise privateering, and thereby have prevented the Confederates
from availing themselves of the results of their naval prowess, and he
affects to regard this step as a sort of declaration against the
South. But he points with justifiable exultation to the successes of
the Confederates, and adds that their enemies are now feeling the
pressure and hardship which the Slave States have borne so
bravely. His note is naturally one of continued defiance. Supposing
that Washington should be moved by the representations of the
Emperor--and we may here observe that some of the Northern journals
think that it would not disgrace the Federals to be the first to
suggest proposals--it is perfectly certain that in the present temper
of the South the very first demand upon the subject of slavery would
be one that would set the still powerful Abolitionist party in a red
flame. The slaves of the States in revolt are as free as a piece of
paper can make them, and it is said that a great number of Virginian
slaves have actually availed themselves of the notification of
New-Year's Day. At all events, some three millions and a half of
slaves have been proclaimed free men. The very first article to be
submitted to Conference by the South must run in this way:--"The
proclamation to be rescinded, the negroes to be formally restored to
slavery, and all blacks who may have availed themselves of the decree
to be given up to the authorities of their respective States." Will
the Abolitionists bear that? For assuredly nothing less will satisfy
the victorious Confederates; and, unless the Washington
plenipotentiaries--if such persons can exist--enter the
Conference-room unprepared to assent to this article they had better
stay at home. It may be that the South would concede a good deal in
return for this article, and for a second which should reaffirm the
desirability of slavery and re-enact it for the Confederate States;
for it would be absurd to suppose that the "Chivalry" are not as tired
of the fratricidal war as the "Yankees;" but is it possible for the
Abolition party to concede this stultification of themselves, this
retractation of all that they have been so clamorously saying for the
last eleven months?</p>

<p>Finally, we may observe that, with recent successes and even in the
face of the disaster at Murfreesboro', the tone of the South has
become firmer and firmer, and it is even more emphatic than ever in
its exultation at the prospect of being freed from the yoke of what it
calls the greedy, hard, usurious Yankee. In a word, the South is bent
upon the experiment of standing alone, and it is impossible to refuse
to it the right of trying that experiment. If the Conference can act
upon the principle of separation, it is, of course, the natural method
of terminating a hideous strife; but, if not, we fear that the
Imperial suggestions are not worth the paper on which they are
written; unless, as is not impossible, they may be intended for
rejection, and this rejection may be intended to be regarded as a
vindication of another step of a different nature.</p></div2>

<p>This act of the Federals which took place on the 11th of December
last, began the late hostilities on the Rappahannock which continued
for five days and ended, as our readers are aware, in a decisive
victory for the Confederates. At the time chosen by our Special Artist
for making the accompanying Illustration (on page 116) the Federals
had over 150 guns directed on the town from the heights on the
opposite side of the river; and it was under cover of this tremendous
cannonade that their troops commenced crossing by three
pontoons. Their dense masses can be seen in the distance winding down
to the river. The town is on fire in various places from the shelling,
but 300 Mississippians still hold their ground as sharpshooters on the
Confederate bank, annoying the heads of the columns as they appear on
the bridges. General Lee's plan, however, as is now well known, was to
let the enemy cross and attack him in the strong position in which he
had ensconced his forces. The infantry moving along the road in the
foreground are proceeding to rifle-pits in front of the battery seen
on the hill on the left, which was the first of the Confederate
defences and held by Colonel Walter's Washington artillery--of which
position more anon.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Incident in the Battle of
Fredericksburg.--The Attack on</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Marye's Hill.</hi></p>

<p>The attempt of the Federals to carry the first of the Confederate
positions on their right--the battery of the Washington Battery, on
Marye's Hill, commanded by Colonel Walton--was, as our readers are
aware, totally unsuccessful, and most disastrous to them. Immense
masses were hurled at intervals on the hill and works, shown in our
Illustration; but at each attack they were driven back with immense
loss. "From the point where I stood, with General Lee and Longstreet,"
says our Special Artist, writing from the Confederate camp, "I could
see the grape, shell, and canister from the guns of the Washington
artillery mow great avenues in the masses of Federal troops rushing to
the assault, while the infantry, posted behind a breastwork just under
the battery, decimated the nearest columns of the enemy. In the
distance, Franklin's corps is seen deploying into line of battle on
the Federal left. They have some field-batteries thrown forwards
shelling the Confederate positions on the wooded range of hills. A
portion of Fredericksburg is seen in the rear of the attacking forces,
and beyond is the range of heights on the opposite aide of the river
from which the Northerners have heavy guns playing on Marye's Hill to
cover the advance of their men. Numbers of their shell are bursting
over the Confederate soldiers in the breastwork. It was here General
Cobb was killed, and it is his brigade acting as sharpshooters. At the
back of this hill a South Carolinian had a portion of his head carried
away within four yards of myself by a shell from the heights alluded
to above. After the battle, I counted 660 dead lying on a small plot
of ground, scarcely four acres in extent, at the foot of the hill
shown in the Illustration; and, altogether 1493 were buried between
the hill and the town. Eight hundred were buried on that part of the
field occupied by Franklin. These were all Federals. This makes the
Northern dead on the right and left amount to 2293. The Federals,
besides this, buried many within their own lines on the night of the
battle."</p>

<p>The Southern correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in
his letter from Richmond, written shortly after the battle of
Fredericksburg, has some remarks on the important post at Marye's
Hill, and of the dreadful slaughter of the assaulting troops, to whose
bravery he bears no niggard testimony. He says:--"By far the most
important position was occupied by the Washington artillery, commanded
by Colonel Walton, of New Orleans, and posted on the heights in the
immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg, not more than 400 yards
from the town. These heights, which are precisely of that altitude
which is most favourable for the play of artillery, are surmounted by
a brick house, now riddled by round shot, belonging to Mr. Marye, and
are commonly called Marye's Heights, At their base a road winds,
protected on one side by the hills and on the other by a solid stone
wall, about four feet in height, over which a brigade of Confederates,
themselves perfectly sheltered, poured the deadliest and most
effective of fires . . . . The battle which had dashed furiously
against the lines of Generals Hood, A. P. Hill, and Early, was little
more than child's play as compared with the onslaught directed by the
Federals in the immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg. The
impression that the Confederate batteries would not fire heavily upon
the Federals advancing in this quarter, for fear of injuring the town
of Fredericksburg, is believed to have prevailed among the Northern
Generals. How bitterly they deceived themselves subsequent events
served to show. To the Irish division, commanded by General Meagher,
was principally committed the desperate task of bursting out of the
town of Fredericksburg and forming under the withering fire of the
Confederate batteries, to attack Marye's Heights, lowering immediately
in their front. Never at Fontenoy, at Albuera, or at Waterloo was more
undoubted courage displayed by the sons of Erin than during those six
frantic dashes which they directed against the almost impregnable
position of their foe. That any mortal men could have carried the
position before which they were wantonly sacrificed, defended as it
was, it seems to me idle for a moment to believe; but the bodies which
lie in dense masses within forty yards of the muzzles of Colonel
Walton's guns are the best evidence what manner of men they were who
pressed on to death with the dauntlessness of a race which lies gamed
glory on a thousand battle-fields, and never more richly deserved it
than at the foot of Marye's Heights on the 13th day of December,
1862."</p>

<p>The same correspondent, in a subsequent letter written on Dec. 20,
thus returns to the subject of the loss of life resulting from the
attack on Marye's Hill:--"A glance at the long slope between the town
of Fredericksburg and the foot of Marye's Heights gave the best idea
of the magnitude of the toll which had been exacted for the Federals'
passage of the Rappahannock. A ride along the whole length of the
lines told also a sad tale of slaughter; but when the eye had once
rested upon the fatal slope above mentioned the memory became fixed
upon the spot, not for fifty-years to come will that scene ever fade
from the memory of those who saw it. There, in every attitude of
death, lying so close to each other that you might step from body to
body, lay acres of the Federal dead. It seemed that most of the faces
which lay nearest to Colonel Walton's artillery were of the well-known
Milesian type. In one small garden, not more than half an acre in
size, there were 151 corpses. I doubt whether in any battle-field of
modern times the dead have ever lain so thick and close. By universal
consent of those who have seen all the great battles of this war
nothing like it has ever been seen before."</p></div2>

<p>General Burnside, on the 20th ult., issued the following address to
his army, preparatory to another assault on the heights beyond
Fredericksburg:--</p>
<q><p>The commanding General announces to the Army of the Potomac that
they are about to meet the enemy once more.</p>
<p>The late brilliant actions in North Carolina, Tennessee, and
Arkansas divided and weakened the enemy on the Rappahannock; and the
auspicious moment seems to have arrived to strike a great and mortal
blow at the rebellion, and to gain that decisive victory which is due
to the country.</p>
<p>Let the gallant officers of so many brilliant battle-fields
accomplish this achievement, and a fame the most glorious awaits
them. The commanding General calls for a firm and united action of
officers and men; and, under the providence of God, the army of the
Potomac will have taken the great step towards restoring peace to the
country and the Government to its rightful authority.</p></q>

<p>A furious storm of rain impeded the promised advance of the army,
but a statement received from the South announces that General Hooker
had crossed the Rappahannock. The state of the Federal army, which is
reported to amount to 135,000 men, inclusive of the reserves under
General Siegel, is unsatisfactory. The men lack their old enthusiasm
and self-confidence, are dissatisfied at not receiving their pay, and
openly express their want of confidence in General Burnside.</p>

<p>On the 18th a small fleet left New York for some point South. It
contained two new ironclads, built by Mr. Ericsson. These vessels, the
Nahant and Weehawken, arrived safely in the Chesapeake after a
boisterous sea passage.</p>

<p>The Confederate authorities have ordered that Federal officers
captured after Jan. 12 shall be delivered up to the Governors of the
States where captured. General Halleck has ordered that no more
Confederate officers shall be released on parole.</p>

<p>The Federal steamer Columbia ran ashore at Masonborough Inlet,
North Carolina, and her commander and crew surrendered to the
Confederates.</p>

<p>In the West the Federal hospital authorities report that their
total loss at Murfreesboro' was 10,287 in killed, wounded, and
missing.</p>

<p>The Federal gun-boats continue their career of success in
Arkansas. They have penetrated 300 miles up the White River, and have
captured four more posts thereon.</p>

<p>On the 16th ult. a body of Confederates attacked the Federal relief
and store ships proceeding up the Cumberland River in Tennessee, and
succeeded in capturing five steam-boats laden with valuable commissary
stores and the gun-boat Slidell. The negro crews were stripped of
their clothing, tied to trees, cowhided, and left to starve on
shore.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has rejected all that portion of
Mr. Chase's financial project which relates to the substitution of a
uniform Federal currency for the present local bank circulation.</p>

<p>The President, after signing the bill for the emission of
100,000,000 dols. in Treasury notes for the payment of the army and
navy, sent a message to Congress begging it to pass Mr. Chase's
financial schemes into law. The message was resented by the Senate as
an attempt at dictation.</p>

<p>A series of resolutions have been introduced in the Senate by a
California senator denouncing the French occupation of Mexico as a
violation of international law and of the London Treaty of October
1861, and requesting President Lincoln to negotiate a treaty with
Mexico, in order to give more effect to the views expressed in these
resolutions. The New York papers, while approving of the spirit of
these resolutions, concur in considering them ill-timed and
impracticable.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the Mexican Minister at Washington and
Mr. Seward has been published. The former complains of the unchecked
shipment of waggons and mules from New York on French
account. Mr. Seward's defence is that, as there has been no
declaration of war between France and Mexico, the duties of neutrals
do not attach to such a state of things. The Mexican Minister next
complains that his side is not allowed to export arms from New
York. Mr. Seward explains that this embargo results from a municipal
law which forbids the export of arms from the United States at this
crisis. The Mexican Minister charges the American Government with
cringing to France.</p>

<p>The Washington <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>
publishes eight columns of intercepted Confederate despatches, being
letters of instruction to Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and other
Confederate agents in Europe. The most important part of the
correspondence relates to a movement on the part of the French Consuls
at Galveston and Richmond to induce Texas to secede from the Southern
Confederacy and establish an independent Government. The result of
this discovery was an  order to General Magruder to send the Consul at
Galveston to Mexico as soon as possible, and the Richmond Consul to
leave forthwith. The order, however, with regard to the latter was
rescinded. It further appears that Mr. Mason was offended by the
uncivil deportment of Earl Russell. The Confederate Secretary of State
complains of the arrogance of many British statesmen as one cause why
England is so little loved, and contrasts the unpoliteness of Earl
Russell with the courtesy of M. Thouvenel.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The inaugural address of the Governor of Delaware expresses strong
Union and Emancipation sentiments, and favours a vigorous prosecution
of the war. The message of the Governor of New Jersey is still more
hostile to the Administration and Emancipation than was the message of
Governor Seymour, of New York.</p>

<p>The tone of the Northern mind is more nervous and desponding than
at any time since the commencement of the war. The Democratic
hostility to the emancipation policy is daily making itself more
troublesome. The tendency to mob violence is increasing. The New York
Legislature has been unable to organise. The candidate of the
Republican party for the office of Speaker has been threatened with
assassination on the floor of the House by members of the Democratic
party. A mob of "rowdies" from New York city have been present in the
galleries and on the floor of the House. The Senate has requested
Governor Seymour to call out the militia to protect the Assembly from
the terrorism of the mob; but the Governor refuses to act against the
most active spirits of his party. Similar scenes have taken place at
Trenton and Harrisburg, the capitals of New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The message of the President of the Republic of Liberia
(Mr. S. A. Benson), received by the last African mail, gives a
satisfactory account of the progress and prospects of that
country. The President details the circumstances of his recent visit
to England, and speaks in grateful terms of the reception accorded to
him, and of the disposition officially manifested to promote a
satisfactory adjustment of boundary and all other questions in which
England, from her position on the African coast, is relatively
interested with Liberia. Great vigilance continues to be exercised by
the Liberian Government to frustrate the slave trade in the
neighbouring territories, and often with considerable success. The
people are paying increased attention to the profitable cultivation of
the soil, and the production of cotton, sugar, and other articles is
likely to increase. Within the last twelve months the sugar-mills have
been imported.  Iron and coal deposits exist, which it is hoped may
soon be turned to account. A conviction is expressed that the war in
the United States will cause an immense voluntary efflux of the
coloured poplulation of that country to Liberia, and this view is
urged as a stimulus to all Liberians, to set such an example of
industry as shall render the Republic increasingly beneficial as a
place of refuge. The notice obtained by the contribution of Liberia to
the International Exhibition is likewise alluded to with
gratification.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p>Whatever light may be thrown upon the foreign relations of America
by the debates which have recommenced at Westminster, it is certain
that the state of the war and the domestic politics of the so-called
Union are involved in a haze which at once obscures and distorts the
objects it envelops. At this moment the American journals which are
supposed to have the best means of procuring information can tell us
neither what is being done nor what is wished. It is true that each of
the leading papers--<hi rend="italic">c&#x00E6;ci
c&#x00E6;cos</hi>--is in a manner wedded to a party. When such is the
case in England, and when such used to be the case in France, the
utterances of party organs were at least frank and intelligible, let
them be worth what they might as exponents of truth. But even the
party organs in Federalia seem afraid of the crisis, of one another,
and of themselves, and anything more helplessly self-contradictory
than the united evidence of the American press upon the present
condition of affairs can hardly be conceived. There seems only one
point upon which they are agreed, although they express their
conviction, of course, with more or less reticence, and that is, that
the President of the North is a mistake. A certain amount of credit is
given to him for being a well-meaning man, but such saving clauses are
always followed by an array of proof that all his well-meanings lead
to bad ends. The Democrats are naturally the most unsparing in their
strictures on Mr. Lincoln. They do not actually invite him to lay down
his authority and subside into the country attorney, but they
endeavour to impress upon the public that, unless he does pretty much
the same thing--namely, abandons all his plans and all his
Cabinet--the nation will be ruined. The Abolitionists are bound to
praise his proclamation; but they regard it as a <hi
rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi> until the war shall be carried on in
a way which they evidently consider him unable to point out, or even
superintend; and, indeed, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> seems
inclined to give up the game, and proposes that the North shall "bow
to malignant fate" if another three months' sharp fighting (again
ninety days) shall not have suppressed the Confederates.</p>

<p>We do not yet hear how the Imperial Message recommending a
conference has been received. But his Majesty's declaration that he
proposes to stop the undue extension of Anglo-Saxon dominion in
America has given great offence, although circumstances will scarcely
permit the Federals to display the anger they feel. We do not attach
much weight to a demonstration which has been made on the subject in
Congress. It is not to be expected that the North will fly in the face
of their former idol and compel him to a recognition for which they
believe him to be only too ready. The celebrated Mexican despatch does
not come formally under the notice of Mr. Seward, and he will hardly
volunteer to take it up; and he may urge that it concerns the South
even more than the North. We shall be surprised if this despatch,
which in other days would have been answered by a riotous
demonstration of defiance, will prevent Mr. Seward from returning a
very polite answer to the conference proposal. We may also risk the
expression of our belief that unless that answer be a direct
acceptance of the scheme--an event hardly within probability--it will
not very much disturb the present plan of the Emperor of the
French.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the army of the Potomac, under
Burnside, is once more to be launched against the Confederates. We
have heard of marchings and counter-marchings, but we finally read an
almost piteous appeal from the Commander-in-Chief urging his soldiery
to do something for the honour of the Union. It is scarcely fair to
put the matter in this way, and, unless we are misinformed, the army
itself sees the unfairness, as well as something else, which it does
not hesitate to talk about. The Federals have gone to the slaughter
with a courage that makes it shocking to see hew badly they are
handled by their leaders. Such men under a Wellington or a Clyde would
have had another story to tell than one of incessant disaster and
defeat. And the courage of the poor foolish hirelings, especially the
Irish, who dashed themselves almost upon the guns that blew them away,
is undeniable. But the army can have no confidence in such leadership
as it has hitherto had, and without confidence in its chiefs an army
is a mob. If it be true that the soldiers of the Potomac are once more
to be brought up to the defences of the Confederates, instead of being
led in a way that offers reasonable hope of success, we see not how
such wanton waste of life is to be justified in the face of
civilisation.</p>

<p>Meantime we are told that the North is really advancing to victory,
for, though defeated in every pitched battle save one, the result of
which was only less disastrous than defeat, it is forcing its way in
upon the Confederate territory at various points other than in
Virginia, and that its attacks are telling upon the resources of the
enemy. It is easy to say this, and it may be consolatory to those who
are prompt to accept such assurances. But where is the proof?
Doubtless New Orleans is in the hands of the Federals (who have done
some good there, by-the-way, in compensation for much evil); but the
possession of the Crescent City has rather relieved the South of a
troublesome and dangerous post than injured the cause of the
Confederates. And we know not what else there is to point at as a
triumph. On the river the Federals have notoriously failed, and it is
thought that the latest failure is still being kept back from the
knowledge of the public. But were twenty "points" made, the sole use
of such occupation is to serve as a basis for operations, and it is
mere child's play to talk of gain when such gain amounts to nothing
but the holding an isolated spot, whence no practical movement can he
made. We in England have had, unhappily, too much acquaintance with
the real meaning of war to be deceived by the nonsense which passes
muster among those who are profoundly ignorant of the true objects and
nature of warfare, though they are singularly prompt at picking up its
technicalities. We judge dispassionately, and we are unable to
perceive that the war is really making any progress at all, or that
the vaunted successes are more than a series of tentatives, more
resembling exploration than military achievement. Furthermore, at the
risk of offence, we must say that we believe the American public to be
hopelessly in the dark as to the campaign; and that, if it were
possible for their vanity to study the strife through the English
newspapers, there would soon be a demonstration of a very different
kind from that of any which has yet been reported. Yes, we say it
frankly--but without the least intention of wounding sensitive
Americans--the fact is, that the boasted press of the North has proved
hollow and rotten in the hour of trial, and when the English press
best vindicates its claims to the respect and confidence of the
people. The Americans have been content with "smart" journals, and the
end of all is that the Union is left at the mercy of ignorance and of
dishonesty. May a better state of things arise out of the present
dismal chaos.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p rend="center">THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi></p>
<p>Her majesty has abstained from taking any step with a view to
induce a cessation of the conflict between the contending parties in
the North American States; because it has not yet seemed to her
Majesty that any such overtures could be attended with any probability of
success.</p>

<p>Her Majesty has viewed with the deepest concern the desolating
warfare which still rages in these regions; and she has witnessed with
heartfelt grief the severe distress and suffering which that war has
inflicted upon a large class of her Majesty's subjects, but which have
been borne by them with noble fortitude and with exemplary
resignation. It is some consolation to her Majesty to be led to hope
that this suffering and this distress are rather diminishing than
increasing, and that some revival of employment is beginning to take
place in the manufacturing districts.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Address.</hi></p>
<p>the Royal Speech having been read by the Lord Chancellor, and
again by the clerk at the table,</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcap">Dudley</hi>rose to move an address in
reply which as usual was a mere echo of the speech itself.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcap">Granard</hi>,in a brief speech,
seconded the oddress.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcap">Derby</hi> contrasted the
circumstances under which the House now assembled with those which
marked the opening of Parliament last year....he was anxious to say
that he had no objection to raise the course which her Majesty's
Government had taken with regard to the desolating war now raging in
the United States. He regretted that the Government had not felt
themselves justified in joining in the attempt, however hopeless, in
which they were invited by the Sovereign of France, not to intervene
for the purpose of putting an end to the war, but to obtain by their
good offices, if possible, such an armistice and cessation of
hostilities as would lead the two parties themselves to reflect on the
miseries and hopelessness of the war in which they were engaged. But,
before he censured the course taken by the Government, it was but fair
that be should say that they were in possession of much better
information than he was as to whether any interference on their part
would have been a judicious step. He differed from the opinion which
had been expressed by many of his political friends that the time had
arrived for recognising the Southern States. There were only two cases
in which a recognition on the part of a neutral Power could be
justified--namely, where there was no further struggle going on, as
was the case when the South American States which had revolted from
Spain were recognised, or when it was desirable in the interest of
humanity that the great Powers should interfere in order to prevent
the longer continuance of a desolating warfare. But in that case
recognition was always followed by something further. It meant the
support by force of arms of the claims of the country whose rights
were recognise, such as was the case in the separation of Belgium from
Holland and of Greece from Turkey. His conviction was that, come what
may, the reconstruction of the United States as they formerly stood
was absolutely impossible; and, on the whole, he approved of the course
which her Majesty's Government had taken. There was another aspect in
which the war in America had a serious bearing upon industry,
happiness, and prosperity of this country--namely, in the cotton
famine which had been produced.</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcap">Russell</hi>, in reply to the remarks of
the noble Lord, justified the policy of non-intervention which the
Government had pursued in reference to the American War. The
circumstances were very different from those which existed when
Belgium was separated from Holland and Greece from Turkey and,
taking all matters into consideration,hbe thought her Majesty's
Government had taken the wisest course in their power to pursue. At
the same time he expressed a strong opinion that it would be
impossible for the union of the Northern and Southern States to be again
established.</p>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcap">Malmesbury</hi> expressed great
regret that her Majesty's Government had not joined with France in an
attempt to mediate between the two contending parties in America, so
that that deplorable struggle might be brought to a satisfactory
termination.</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcap">Grey</hi> differed from Lord Malmesbury in
believing that the Government had neglected their duty in declining to
join with France in the offer of their good offices in the dispute
between the Northern and Southern States of America.  If the good
offices of her Majesty's Government in conjunction with France would
have contributed to produce the termination of the war it would have
been unpardonable if they had refused to exercise them; but, looking at the state
of feeling in America with regard to this country at that time, he
thought the interference of the Government would have produced more
harm than good.</p>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The Address In Answer To The Queen's
Speech.</hi></p>
<p>The Speaker having read from the chair her Majesty'e gracious
Speech,</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Calthorpe</hi> rose to move the address in
reply, and, reviewing the principal topics of the Queen's Speech,
briefly but warmly eulogised the proceedings and policy of the
Government. He warmly acknowledged the subscriptions from America
for the distress in Lancashire; which, sent in the midst of the
pettish and hostile attacks of the press, showed that the respectable
classes were well disposed toward England. He deeply deplored the
course of the war, and the extremes to which the more violent parties
were ready to go in the Northern States, at the same time expressing a
hearty admiration of the gallantry and fortitude of the
Confederates.</p>
<p>The address having been read from the chair,</p>
<p>Mr.<hi rend="smallcap">Disraeli</hi> said the House would deeply
sympathise with the feelings of her Majesty on so interesting an event
as the marriage of the heir apparent....</p>
<p>The House would also deeply sympathise with the Sovereign in
deploring the vicissitudes to which a large and important portion of
her subjects had been subjected, and in her admiration of the
fortitude with which they had been sustained. He trusted that these
vicissitudes would, however, have a tendency towards promoting a
sounder and more permanent prosperity; and, whilst, they might rather
be regarded us a misfortune than a calamity, they would teach all
classes that they had an interest in one great commmonwealth. They
might on such occasions expect to learn how long this state of things
was likely to last; but, for his own part, he could not but regard
what was passing in America as a revolution. He briefly sketched the
rise of the Union, and expressed an opinion that the ultimate results
of the war would be an America very different to that known to our
fathers and even to this generation. There would be an America of
farmers, an America of diplomacy, and an America of turbulence and
wars. He believed that the course originally marked out by the
Government was one honorable to the country and beneficial to all its
interests. He was, therefore, greatly mortified in the autumn when an
important member of the Government, apparently with the sanction of
his colleagues, made a declaration which could only be regarded as an
intention to recognise the Confederate Republic. He felt that this was
a great vacillation and inconsistency. The Foreign Secretary said that
the North was fighting for empire and the South for independence; but
the President of the Board of Trade the other day alleged that the
cause of the war was slavery. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was
warmly in favour of the South; but he was followed by the Secretary at
War, who avowed opinions diametrically opposite; and, lastly, the
Chief Secretary of Ireland declared that it was his conviction that
the Lord of Hosts was fighting for the Confederates.</p></div2>

<p>The friends of the negro held a "monster" meeting at Exeter Hall
last week--so crowded a one that it overflowed the limits of the large
hall and filled an oratorical cistern in the basement, and an al
fresco tank in Exeter-street. The proceedings were of a most
enthusiastic character, and the cause of the North, in connection with
that of the abolition of slavery--for which last consummation all good
men and true must fervently pray--was energetically advocated. The
literary element was represented by Mr. Thomas Hughes, author of "Tom
Brown's Schooldays" and "Tom Brown at Oxford," and by
Mr. J. M. Ludlow.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">NEGRO EMANCIPATION: THE MEETING IN</p>
<p rend="center">EXETER HALL.</p>

<p>As there are currents in the deep sea (well known to the careful
mariner) which have no necessary connection with the course of the
waves on the surface, and are often diametrically opposed to them,
even when these latter appear to be triumphantly sweeping along
towards a given destination, so it seems public opinion may at the
most critical moments display similar phenomena; and startle the
political mariner by the discovery that all his art in trimming his
sails to the wind, all his steadiness in directing the helm, do not
enable him to baffle or escape from the unseen "ground-swell" below,
which is carrying him he hardly knows whither, but certainly not in
the way that he wanted to go.</p>

<p>No event in recent times has so strongly helped to remind us of
this well-known, but half-forgotten, truth as the meeting of Thursday
week in Exeter Hall. Here have we been for many months past pretty
well all of one mind as to the American question, that is to say,
convinced the North is fighting for "empires" and the South for
"independence;" convinced that if the latter did not exactly behave
well in the outbreak of the war, it has fought so splendidly since
that it cannot be subjugated, and must therefore, in the end succeed ;
convinced, finally, that it would be best on the whole to leave slavery
at present where it is, in the hands of the masters, and trust to the
progress of humanity, of knowledge, of economical laws, and of the
absence of irritation through abolition attacks, to do away
ultimately with so great an evil. That, we believe, is a fair
statement of the opinions predominant generally through society, in
accordance with the ceaseless teaching of nine-tenths of the whole
English press.</p>

<p>But of late a new element has begun to be dimly visible. As the
Northern Legislation and Administration have become of a more
decidedly anti-slavery cast we have heard of small local meetings
rising like bubbles to the surface of public opinion, and evaporating
with a feeble breath in favour of the North. Then it undoubtedly
excited surprise that the Lancashire operatives were so quiet under
all their sufferings as to render it impossible to rouse them into an
active agitation for blockade-breaking; and somehow it began to be
whispered about that the explanation of their conduct was that they
didn't feel quite satisfied about slavery not being at the bottom of
the whole business of Southern revolt. But when Mr. Lincoln's
proclamation of September last, offering emancipation with
compensation up to Jan. 1, and threatening emancipation without
compensation on and after that day if his offer were not
accepted--when this broke like a thunder-clap upon the world, we
entered upon a new and difficult, and anxious period. For, while on
the one hand there were but few persons who did not still loudly
denounce slavery, there were still fewer who did not see that
Mr. Lincoln's Government had taken that tremendous step not because it
was advisable or right in itself, but because he found the North
could not beat the South without doing so. Of course, in saying this
we do not say or suggest that Mr. Lincoln was a hypocrite, or that he
acted in opposition to his known character, antecedents, or wishes. We
only say, as a matter of fact which cannot be disputed, that while
the previous anti-slavery measures, such as (among others) the
abolition of slavery in Columbia, the anti-slave trade treaty with
England, the permanent exclusion of slavery from the territories, and
the offer of Congress to assist the work of abolition by compensation,
all obviously sprang from a genuine anti-slavery sentiment, this
particular proclamation, the last of the series, as obviously did not,
but from the military failures of the North. No wonder, then, that
the general current and opinion (having previously been such as we have
described it) still remained on the whole friendly to the South and
unfriendly to the North, or that it began to be generally believed
that Mr. Lincoln's "military measure" would prove in its working a
very inhuman measure, as leading to a servile war.</p>

<p>But now there also began to be heard rumours of the formation of
some new society--an Emancipation Society--originating, like the old
anti-slavery body, in the religious, and mainly in the dissenting,
world. Names of supporters began to be handed about, some of them
enjoying universal respect, some of them of world-wide
reputation. More local meetings were heard of--especially in the
metropolis. Then suddenly Manchester burst out with an assemblage
several thousand strong in the Free Trade Hall. Liverpool merchants
and others assembled to prepare for the renewal in their town of the
former anti-slavery agitation, and decided, by an "overwhelming
majority," to do so, in spite of Mr. Spence, who was present, and made
an eloquent, gallant, but unavailing effort to keep out of the
resolutions an expression of sympathy with the North. Then, too, the
journals condescended to notice the society in leaders, though the
notices were not more complimentary than the conversation between the
Prince and the beggarboy, of which the boy was so proud, and which
consisted simply in the Prince's telling him to get out of the
way.</p>

<p>But whether the Emancipation Society esteemed the honour of being
thus noticed more than it felt the sting of the contemptuous words in
which the notices were couched, or whether it grew bolder through
these preliminary meetings, it certainly ventured at last to issue its
challenge to universal London, and "respectfully" to invite "all
parties" to the great room of Exeter Hall on the night of Thursday,
the 29th of January, 1863. We ore careful to record the date; for, if
we do not misread the signs then and there presented this meeting will
prove the turning-point of new and serious political issues. Thither
we ask the reader mentally to accompany us, promising him he need be
under no apprehension that we are about to try to influence his
sympathies or guide his judgment; we assume only the humbler task of
recording honestly that which we have heard and seen; and which he,
as an Englishman, knowing how the greatness of our country is
nurtured by the free expression of all honest opinion, and how
dependent the true statesman must be upon the accurate knowledge of
all such opinion, will, we are sure, be glad to have faithfully
related.</p>

<p>Having tickets for reserved seats we do not present ourselves till
about ten minutes before the time specified on them--seven o'clock;
but as we ascend the steps of the portico, we are warned by the
streams of people that we are, perhaps, taking the matter too
leisurely. And so we find it when we get our first glimpse of the
hall, and hurriedly ask for the seats that were to have been
reserved. "Where can we go?"  we ask despairingly, moved out of our
previous equanimity. The doorkeeper points to the far-distant gallery,
high up and says he thinks there may yet be a chance there. But even
if he be right, 'hich looks doubtful, it is certain that scores--nay,
hundreds--of other persons will be discovering the vacancies long
before we can possibly get there. We rush down stairs, speak to an
official, use the open sesame of "the press," and are hopefully
dismissed in quite another direction. But now, progress of any kind,
even through the corridors and passages, becomes difficult, at times
impossible, through the surging crowd who toss helplessly about,
seeking rest for the soles of their feet and finding none. There are
backward eddies to break through, as well as forward ones to force a
place among. Presently we are stopped by a barrier across a flight of
stairs descending into a lobby, where we pant and strive. "No one can
pass; the place is more than full." We glide round the side of the
stairs, climb up and up, get over the banister, and find we have,
unnoticed, turned the enemy's stronghold. Still in vain,
however. Everywhere we find dense masses of people; and we are about
to make the Englishman's last confession and acknowledge ourselves
beaten, when, happily, we come across one of the speakers of the night
floundering in the same difficult strait, but who obviously <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get
in. That fact gives us new hope. We appeal to him. He gallantly
takes us in tow, shouts "Reporter!" when advance is otherwise
impossible, and so we get at last into a sort of little black hole of
Calcutta, where we grow at once hopeless of further progress and
certain of being stifled if we stay where we are. Here, however, to
our immense relief, a door opens; some half dozen of us are shot
suddenly forwards and luckily do not fall; another instant, and we are
running up the stairs of the little box or covered way that admits
us to the platform, and there find breathing space and full
opportunity to drink in, in one wondering, awe-stricken glance, the
sublime spectacle of a vast sea of upturned faces, looking up towards
another sea scarcely less large that, in defiance of all the laws of
gravity, has ascended and overflowed every nook and corner of the
upraised expanse of the orchestra, leaving only the organ in the
centre towering calmly above the excited and sloping tide of life.</p>

<p>But scarcely has this seething mass of humanity begun to grow quiet
and satisfied in the pleasant and soothing sense of successful
conquest and possession, and to address itself to the business of the
night, before we hear distant but mighty shouts below, rumbling like
thunder among the valleys to an observer seated high on the hills; and
presently it is whispered about that the mere overflow of this hall
has filled another hall below, and that these shouts are from that
second exulting army on taking possession. But even that hall, we
soon hear, is equally incapable of dealing with the inflowing streams
of people, so, presently, the adjoining street (Exeter-street ) is
ringing with the tumultuous cheers of a third meeting, held in the
open air! Under these circumstances, and with the frequently-occurring incident that when we, who were above, were
trying to be quiet and listen, those distant reverberations would come
up to the ear with a most dramatic and exciting effect from below. It
is no wonder that the proper business of the evening went on under a
kind of high-pressure system, mentally and morally, and made it
difficult for the calmest heads to preserve their equilibrium.</p>

<p>Yet is it especially worthy of note (whatever the use made of the
fact) that none of the ordinary attractions helped to bring together
this wonderful gathering. It is quite true what has been said, that no
eminent statesmen or politicians were here; that few or none of the
old and famous anti-slavery families were represented; that none of
the speakers were men of genius; that commerce sent none of its
merchant princes; the aristocracy and gentry none of their
conspicuous members. But for that very reason we are driven to
confess how great must have been the "ground-swell" of public opinion
before it could thus burst upon our astonished eyes with all the
suddenness and glory of the maelstrom and the waterspout, unless,
indeed, we accept the solution since offered--that Federal money was
the mainspring!</p>

<p>The speakers of the evening were the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel;
Mr. Hughes, the well-known author of "Tom Brown;" the Rev. Mr. Newman
Hall; Mr. Taylor, the member for Leicester; and Mr. Ludlow, a
well-known contributer to <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's
Magazine</hi>. Among the faces of supporters on the platform one could
also distinguish Mr. Beales, Mr. Lucas; Mr. Victor Sch&#x0153;lcher, the
French exile; Mr. Morse, the American Consul-General, and himself
distinguished as a man of practical science; Mr. Chamerovzow, the
secretary of the old Anti-Slavery Society, whose presence served to
unite the parent body with this, its vigorous successor; many
clergymen, including Mr. Landells, Dawson Burns, T. C. Solly, and
Rylance; and a number of other gentlemen with whom the general public
is more or less familiarly acquainted.</p>

<p>We should observe that Mr. Baptist Noel modestly acknowledged the
farce of the sarcasms that have been launched as to the
insignificance of the promoters, but added, "they were only the
pickets of the great army of emancipation in this country;" and the
felicity of the retort was enhanced by the fact that the first
business of the meeting was to read letters of sympathy which had
been received from such persons as James Stuart Mill, the first of
living political economists; from General Thompson, illustrious in
the old days of anti-slavery and free-trade agitation (and who
characteristically inclosed &#x00A3;10 to the society as the best way of
helping the Lancashire operatives); from Mr. James Stansfeld, and
Mr. W. E. Forster, the two most promising of all the independent
Liberals recently elected to Parliament; from Professors Cairne,
Newman, and Goldwin Smith; from Mr. E. Miall, Mr. George Thompson,
and several gentlemen of local standing in our chief cities. The
emancipation army, therefore, will not apparently be without its
Parliamentiary, generals, or its scholarly guides, whenever it begins
to march.</p>

<p>If it had been possible, after watching the reception given to the
first sentences from the chairman, the Rev. Mr. Evans, to doubt the
tone and temper of the assembled multitude, it was clearly impossible
to do so when he referred in a perfectly dispassionate manner to those
who wished to see America divided into two confederacies. He was
interrupted by a single voice that cried out "Emancipation and union!"
and then, as if that phrase had been a kind of electric shock that
went to every heart, there broke forth the most tremendous outburst of
popular enthusiasm it has ever been our fortune to witness. It could
not stop, but went on and on, the whole audience having leaped to
their feet with hats and handkerchiefs waving, having apparently only
waited for some such signal to relieve themselves from the almost painful
because suspended enthusiasm with which they overflowed. This
incident told all that any one could have needed to know as to the
feelings and views of the meeting. But the facts were to receive a
still more remarkable illustration. When the chairman, a little later,
happened to use the words, "Mr. Lincoln's election," again the same
tremendous cheers arose, and if the President could only have heard
them he must have begun to doubt his own identity with the
"best-abused" man alive, as he is generally esteemed to be.</p>

<p>Another incident of the meeting was interesting. Mr. Noel, towards
the close of his impassioned speech (which, however, was not distinctly
heard), stopped to announce that the men of Bradford (4000 strong)
were at that moment holding a similar meeting; and he proposed, to the
great satisfaction of his auditory, to dispatch a telegram saying, "We
are for emancipation and the Union; what are you?" Exactly the same
kind of thing occurred at a later hour with regard to Stroud, where,
also, an emancipation meeting was being held. These interruptions,
with those arising from the constant re-echoing of the cheers from the
two other meetings below and outside, gave quite a tone to the
evening.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to describe the speeches, We desire only to
note those passages in them which helped to bring out into strong
relief the state of opinion that prevailed in the meeting. Mr. Noel's
speech was studded with such points. His narrative of recent
proceedings in the South with regard to the cruel punishment of the
slaves; his assertion, founded on the testimony of Mr. Jay, that at
least one negro had been burned annually for twenty years for rising
against their masters; his characterization of the Southern leaders as
men of powerful intellect and energy; his demand to know the meaning
of Mr. Davis's statement that the proclamation has doomed millions of
beings of an inferior race to extermination--all these were caught up
so rapturously as to convey the impression that the speaker must have
expressed the views of his auditory even more perfectly than his
own.</p>

<p>Still it must not be supposed that all the audience were of one
mind. From each side of the platform, from the back of the platform,
from the middle of the great gallery, from the middle and sides of the
vast hall, rose from time to time cries of dissent and sarcasm; but
when an amendment was moved, and the mover, after fruitless efforts
to be heard, aided by a chivalrous but useless appeal from Mr. Newman
Hall, had it read by the latter and put to the vote, the opposition
dwindled away into some say two, some a dozen pair of hands, and so
put the seal to his signal discomfiture, A similar but later attempt
was equally ludicrous in its failure.</p>

<p>Decidedly the crowning speech of the evening was Mr. Newman
Hall's. His voice alone of all the speakers' voices filled easily and
perfectly the enormous space. His slight physique, earnest face, and
self-possessed yet impressive manner, must have given to many, as it
did to us, an idea of the strength of the Puritan element yet existing
among us, but not allied, as so often it was of old, to fanaticism or
to spiritual blindness towards everything grand or beautiful that is
not directly and obviously religious. He it was who frankly said they
were not there to justify the Northern dealing with the negro; not
there as advocates of the Union (which be still does advocate), but
of emancipation. And as his was perhaps the most highly finished and
certainly the most successful oratorical display of the evening, we
quote the peroration of his speech, with its magnificent invective
against slavery, where he asserts:--</p>

<q><p>That "God has made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the
face of all the earth" (cheers); that there is no right so sacred as
that which a man has to himself, no wrong so flagrant as that of
robbing a man of himself (cheers); that it is an abomination to steal
a man and to sell him (loud cheers); that it is no less an abomination
to breed a man and to sell him (Hear, hear) than for a man to barter
away his own offspring for gold (loud cheers); that it is an
abomination to expose men and women on the auction-block and feel
their muscles and hand them over to the highest bidder as you would
cattle (Shame!); that it is an abomination to deny to a woman the
rights of chastity and maternity (Hear); that it is an abomination to
declare that a coloured man has no rights which a white man need
respect (Hear, hear); that it is an abomination to flog a naked woman,
whether she be a Hungarian Countess or an African slave (Hear, hear);
that it is an abomination to fine, imprison, flog, and, on a
repetition of the act, hang a man far teaching another man to read the
Bible (Hear, hear); that it is hideous blasphemy to cite that Bible of
a God of love in defence of such abominations (Hear, hear); that a
confederacy of men fighting in order to commit these abominations
should be regarded as engaged in a portentous piracy rather than in
legitimate warfare (cheers); that the conscience and heart of free
England can never wish to recognise an empire avowing as its
corner-stone the right to maintain and extend those abominations
(cheers); and, lastly, as the recognition of an empire involves
reception of its Ambassador, that the loyalty of Great Britain
loathes the very idea of such an indignity being offered to the Royal
Lady we delight to venerate as that her pure, matronly, and widowed
hand, which wields only the sceptre of love over the free, should ever
be contaminated by the kiss of any representative of so foul a conspiracy against
civilisation, humanity, and God!</p></q>

<p>We should despair of any attempt to give our readers on adequate
notion of the feeling called forth towards our Queen or against
slavery by the last sentence.</p>

<p>Our narrowing space will not allow us to dwell on Mr. Taylor's
powerful speech, in which he called John Brown "the Garibaldi of
America," and so evoked a new manifestation in honour of the memory of
the man whose soul is said to be ever marching on to the conquest of
slavery; or to Mr. Ludlow's, which was too late in the evening to be
done justice to. There is an end to everything, even to the enthusiasm
of such a meeting as this; so, after he had again roused to something
like light and glow the temper of the meeting in relation to
Mr. Beresford Hope's attacks on Mr. Lincoln's infamy as exceeding
even the infamy of Belshazzar, the proceedings were rapidly brought
to a close.</p>

<p>And then, on once more reaching the open air, we heard that a
second meeting had been held in Exeter-street larger than the first one,
in order to draw off the crowds from some unhappy Southern
sympathisers who had been too freely expressing their sentiments. No
less, therefore, than four distinct meetings had been developed out of
the one intended meeting, each with its own chairman and speakers,
among whom were Mr. Noel, Mr. Shaen, and several gentlemen who had
been in America, including the chaplain of General Burnside.</p>

<p>We conclude, as we began, with no intention to express here our own
views. But this one remark may be permitted. Whatever the result as
regards North and South--the permanent rupture or the reunion of the
States--it is impossible to doubt that the Divine hand is so fashioning
things as to destroy slavery.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">FRANCE AND AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi> gave last week a summary of the
despatch addressed by M. Drouyn de Lhuys, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, to M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington,
suggesting proposals of peace to the Federal Government. The following
is a full translation of the document:--</p>

<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">To M. Mercier, Minister Of The
Emperor At Washington.</hi></p>
<p rend="right">Paris, Jan. 9, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir,--If in forming the project of endeavouring by the offer of our
good offices to shorten the duration of hostilities which are
desolating the American Continent we had not above all things been
guided by the friendship for the United States which animates the
Government of the Emperor, the small success of our overtures might
have diminished the interest we feel in the incidents of this
struggle. But the sentiment we have obeyed is too sincere to allow
indifference to obtain entrance into our minds, or to prevent us from
being painfully affected by the continuance of the conflict. We cannot
regard without profound regret this more than civil war, which may be
compared with the most terrible intestine commotions of the old
republics, and the disasters of which multiply in proportion to the
resources and the courage displayed by each of the belligerents.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Government have fully examined, therefore, the
objections made to us when we suggested the idea of a friendly
mediation, and we have asked ourselves if they are really of a kind to
exclude as premature all attempts at reconciliation.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the repugnance of the United States to admit the
intervention of foreign influence has been pointed out to us; and, on
the other, the hope which the Federal Government has not abandoned of
obtaining a solution by force of arms.</p>

<p>Assuredly, Sir, there is nothing in recurring to the good offices
of one or several neutral Powers incompatible with the legitimate
pride of a great nation; and purely international wars do not alone
furnish us with examples of the useful part played by mediators. We
conceive, moreover, that in offering to place ourselves at the
disposition of the belligerents for the purpose of faciliting
between them negotiations, the basis of which we abstained from
prejudicing, we rendered to the patriotism of the United States the
regard more than ever due to it now, after so many fresh proofs of
moral force and energy. We are not less prepared, in the desires we 
entertain in favour of peace, to make allowance for the
susceptibilities of national sentiment, and we in nowise dispute the
right of the Federal Government to decline thee cooperation of the
great maritime Powers of Europe. But is this cooperation the only
means of shortening the war which offers itself to the Washington
Cabinet? And if the latter thinks it ought to reject all foreign
intervention, might it not honourably accept the idea of direct
negotiations with the authority which represents the South?</p>

<p>The Federal Government, we know, does not despair of giving a more
active impulse to hostilities: sacrifices have not exhausted its
resources, still less its perseverance or its firmness. The duration
of the struggle, in fact, has not shaken its confidence in the
ultimate success of its effort. But the opening of negotiations
between the belligerents does not necessarily imply the immediate
cessation of hostilities. Negotiations for peace are not always the
result of a suspension of arms; on the contrary, they more frequently
precede the establishment of a truce. Have not Plenipotentiaries often
been known to assemble, exchange communications, agree upon all the
essential clauses of treaties--nay, even decide the question of peace or
war--while the military leaders continued the struggle and endeavoured
to the last moment to mollify the conditions of peace by the force of
arms? To take only one instance in the history of the United
States--the negotiations which established their independence commenced
long before hostilities had ceased in the New World, and the armistice
was only established by the instrument of the 30th of November, 1782,
which, under the title of Provisional Articles, contained by
anticipation the principal clauses of the final treaty of 1783.</p>

<p>Nothing, therefore, would prevent the United States'
Government--without renouncing the advantages it may anticipate from
the continuation of the war--from entering into negotiations with the
Southern Confederates, supposing the Confederates themselves are
willing. Representatives, or commissioners of the two sides, could meet
at a given place, which it might be desirable to declare neuter for
that purpose. The complaints of both might be examined at this
meeting. Instead of the accusations at present interchanged between
North and South, a discussion of the interests which divide them would
be substituted. They would determine, by regular and comprehensive
deliberations, whether these interests are definitively
irreconciliable; whether separation is an extremity which can no longer be avoided; or
whether the recollections of a common experience and the ties of every
kind which have made North and South one and the same Federal State and
raised it to such a height of prosperity are not more powerful than
the causes which have induced the two populations to take up arms.</p>

<p>A negotiation, the object of which was thus determined, would not
carry with it any of the objections urged against a diplomatic
intervention of Europe; and without giving rise to the same hopes as
the immediate conclusion of an armistice, it would exercise a
favourable influence upon the progress of events. Why, therefore should
not a suggestion which pays all deference to the feelings of the
United States obtain the approbation of the Federal Government?
Persuaded as we are that it is in conformity with their real
interests, we do not hesitate to recommend it to their attention; and,
not having desired to make any ostentatious parade of influence in
the proposed mediation of the maritime Powers, we should rejoice,
without the slightest feeling of <hi rend="italic">amour propre</hi> at the opening of
negotiations summoning the two populations to discuss the relation of
their differences without the co-operation of Europe. I beg of you to
assure the Washington Cabinet of this in recommending to its wisdom
counsels that are dictated by the most sincere interest in the
prosperity of the United States. You are authorised, moreover, to
leave with Mr. Seward a copy of this despatch, if he wishes to have
one.</p>

<p>The Montreal Company's steamer Hibernian has brought us Boston

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Burnside has resigned the command of the army of the
Potomac, and General Hooker has been appointed his successor. Generals
Franklin and Sumner have been relieved of their commands. In their
places General Couch commands the right, General Mead the centre,
General W. F. Smith the left, and General Siegel the reserve. Snow is
six feet deep at Falmouth, and the roads are impassable. General
Burnside's letter of resignation says that the army would, under more
favourable circumstances, have accomplished great results. In General
Hooker's short address on taking command there occurs the following
passage:--</p>
<q><p>In the record of your achievements there is much to be proud of,
and with the blessing of God we will contribute something to the
renown of our arms and the success of our cause. To secure these ends
your commander will require the cheerful and zealous co-operation of
every officer and soldier in this army. In equipment, intelligence,
and valour the enemy is our inferior. Let us never hesitate to give
him battle, wherever we can find him.</p></q>

<p>General Burnside is to be examined before a Senatorial Committee
concerning the obstacles thrown in his way by inferior
officers. A list has been prepared of more than eighty army officers
who are to be summarily dismissed from the service, for the use of
improper language in reference to their superiors and the
Commander-in-Chief in connection with the removal of General
M'Clellan, and the court-martial and sentence of General Fitz-John
Porter.</p>

<p>General Franklin has demanded a court-martial to inquire into the
alleged charges against him of tardiness and inefficiency.</p>
<p>General Joseph Hooker is a native of Massachusetts. He served in
Mexico on General Pillow's Staff, but resigned after the war. He was
living in California when the war broke out. General Burnside has
retired to his State, Rhode Island, where he has been flatteringly
received by his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>The reports that the army of the Potomac is much "demoralised" by
the attitude taken by the Democratic party are confirmed.</p>
<p>General Foster's (Federal) army in North Carolina has had a slight
advantage, and was advancing in two columns in Wilmington and
Kingston.</p>

<p>From Port Royal we hear that a naval conflict was impending between
the Federal gun-boat Montauk and the Confederate ram Fingal, said to
be guarding the steamer Nashville.</p><pb n="167"/>

<p>Accounts from Savannah report extensive depredations upon the
American shipping in the West Indies by the Confederate steamer Crete,
now called the Florida. Great consternation prevailed among the
American captains in the West Indies, and several, whose vessals were
ready for sea, had not ventured to leave port.</p>

<p>A Confederate steamer, supposed to be the Alabama, after a sharp
engagement, sunk the Federal gun-boat Hatteras off Galveston. The
Hatteras sank with all on board, except one officer and five man, who
were picked up by the Brooklyn. The Hatteras was an ironclad carrying
three rifled 32-pounders.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">En revanche</hi>, the Federals have destroyed the
Confederate iron-clad steamer in Bayoutche. They have also flanked the
Confederate forces in that section.</p>

<p>The Federal forces in the south-west combined for a third attempt
to open the Mississippi have commenced operations near the mouth of
the Yazoo. General M'Clernand has left the Arkansas River and
retraced his course to Young's Point, where it is reported that he has
landed his troops. Generals Grant, Sherman, and Gorian will unite in
the operations. General M'Clernand's troops have recommenced work in
the canal dug some months ago by the negroes under General Williams,
with the intention of diverting the channel of the Mississippi from
the bed of the river opposite Vicksburg.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>The financial bill framed by the Committee of Ways and Means has
passed the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The chief subject of discussion had been the enlistment of negro
regiments, to which the opposition are bitterly opposed. They have
hitherto prevented any vote being taken on the subject.</p>

<p>In the Senate, Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, was given into custody
for using the phrase "that imbecile Lincoln." On being arrested, by
the Sergeant-at-Arms he drew forth a revolver, uttering threats
against the Chairman and Mr. Sumner. The next day a resolution was
brought forward to expel him from the Senate, but it was dropped on
his apologising for his misconduct.</p>

<p>Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, has obtained permission from the
President to raise companies of persons of African descent, "organised
into a separate corps," for garrison and other duty within the
State.</p>

<p>The Administration is engaged in preparing to bring before the
Supreme Court of the United States the important question of the power
of the President in times of rebellion to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus. The Administration is determined to settle this question at
once, as there are many cases now pending in several State Courts, and
additional ones are springing up almost daily. The latest is the
arrest of Mr. Boileau, editor and proprietor of the Philadelphia
<hi rend="italic">Evening Journal</hi> on the charge of a treasonable article on Jefferson
Davis' Message. His case is warmly espoused by the Democratic party in
the State Legislature, and by the grand jury of the county of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The emancipation cause progresses in Missouri. Both Houses of the
State Legislature have passed the resolution asking Congress to
appropriate 25,000,000 dols. for emancipation.</p>

<p>The Republican candidate for Speaker has been elected by a majority
of two in the New York Assembly.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan has been enthusiastically received by the people
of Boston and many of the smaller towns in Massachusetts. Strong
demonstrations in his favour have taken place in Congress. Some
members in the course of the debate having urged his recall to the
head of the army, the suggestions were met with loud cheering in the
galleries.</p>

<p>Gold continues to rise in value. It has now reached 59 per cent
premium. In San Francisco the legal-tender notes were worth only 60
cents in specie.</p></div2>

<p>Mr. Lincoln has replied to the address adopted at "the meeting of
the working men" held at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, at the close
of last year. The President deplores the sufferings to which the
cotton famine has given rise, but rejoices at the failure of the
efforts of "disloyal American citizens" to induce the operatives on
this side of the Atlantic to favour the attempt to establish a
Government resting "exclusively on the basis of human slavery." He
regards the "decisive utterances" of the gathering presided over
by Mr. Abel Heywood "as an instance of sublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any
country," and he trusts that the sentiments expressed in the
address will be sustained by the English nation. He further "hails
this interchange of sentiment as an augury that, whatever
else wmy happen, the peace and friendship which now exist between
the two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them,
perpetual."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General Lee.</hi></p>
<p>Our Artist in the Confederate camp, near Fredericksburg, has
forwarded to us a Portrait of General Lee, Commander of the
Confederate army in Northern Virginia, which is here reproduced. The
Richmond correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> writes as
follows respecting him:--</p>
<p>"General Lee is, I believe, between fifty and sixty years of age,
but wears his years well, and strikes you as the incarnation of health
and endurance as he rears his erect soldierllke form from his seat by
the fireside to greet courteously the stranger. His manner is calm and
stately, his presence impressive and imposing; his dark brown eyes are
remarkably direct and honest as they meet you fully and firmly,
inspiring great confidence. The shape and type of the head a little
resemble Garibaldi's, and the features are those of a much handsomer
man. On the rare occasions when he smiles, and on the still rarer
occasions when he laughs heartily, disclosing a fine unbroken row of
white firm-set teeth, the confidence and sympathy which he inspires
are irresistible. A child thrown among a knot of strangers would be
inevitably drawn to General Lee first in the company, and would run to
claim his protection. His voice is fine and deep but slightly
monotonous in its tone. Altogether, the most winning attribute of the
General is his unaffected childlike guilelessness. It is very rare that
a man of his age, conversant with important events, and thrown to the
surface of mighty convulsions, retains the impress of a simple
ingenuous nature to so eminent a degree. It is impossible to converse
with him for ten minutes without perceiving how deeply he has
meditated upon all the possible eventualities of the campaign in
Virginia, and how sound and well-considered are the positions which he
advances. It is obvious that the most entire and trusting confidence
is placed in General Lee by his subordinate officers, whose respect
and affection he seems thoroughly to have won."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General "Stonewall"
Jackson.</hi></p>

<p>Although a Portrait of General "Stonewall" Jackson has appeared in
this Journal, we offer no excuse for presenting another of the
redoubtable hero from a sketch recently taken by our Special Artist in
the Confederate camp, Northern Virginia, where General Jackson is at
present located. Appended are a few particulars concerning him from
the authority which we have just quoted:--</p>

<p>"At a distance of seven miles from General Lee's head-quarters,
near the little village of Bunker Hill, were the head-quarters of
General 'Stonewall' Jackson. I had been taught to expect a morose,
reserved, distant reception; I found the most genial, courteous, and
forthcoming of companions. A bright piercing blue eye, a slightly
aquiline nose, a thin, tall sinewy frame 'made all over of pinwire,' a
great disregard of dress and appearance--these are the characteristics
of General Jackson's exterior. There is also about him every direct
and honest look. The disappointing circumstance is that his voice,
which is rapid in its utterance, is weak and
unimpressive. Passionately attached to the Valley of Virginia, which
has for so long been the principal scene of his achievements, idolised
by the inhabitants of Winchester and of the valley, General Jackson
has acquired such a fame in that entire neighbourhood that it is sad
to think what would happen if the one life round which such prestige
clings should yield to a stray bullet or to the chance of
disease. Sinewy and wiry as the General seems, it is impossible not to
fancy that he is wearing himself terribly by his restless, sleepless
activity, by his midnight marches, and by the asceticism of his
life. The respect and consciousness of his presence, and what that
presence means, exhibited by his staff, impressed me very strongly,
and seemed to exceed the respect exhibited towards General Lee....As
there are many conflicting reports about the origin of the name of
'Stonewall,' it may be interesting to repeat the true circumstances
under which it was given. In the first battle of Manassas, on July
21, 1861, General Bee, of South Carolina (himself subsequently
killed in the same action), observing his men flinching and
wavering, called out to them to stand firm, exclaiming, 'Look at
Jackson's men; they stand like a stone wall!' In his official report of
the battle, General Beauregard employed the same expression in
connection with General Jackson's command, and the name has clung to
General Jackson ever since."</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson Jackson was born in Virginia about the year
1825.</p></div2>

<p>There is nothing important from the army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>In a slight affair near the Blackwater, Virginia, the 167th
Pennsylvania Regiment, composed of draughted men, refused to fight and
lay down upon the ground during the entire engagement, saying, "You
can draught us; but you cannot make us fight."</p>
<p>General Foster's expedition from Beaufort had been seen off Cape
Fear, en route for Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 31st ult. two Confederate iron-clad gun-boats, accompanied
by three steamers, went out from Charleston at one o'clock in the
morning and attacked the blockading squadron. The engagement commenced
at four o'clock. The Confederate gun-boats sank the Federal gunboat
Mercedita, carrying eleven guns, and another Federal gun-boat whose
name is unknown. They disabled the Federal steamer Quaker City, but
she escaped with the loss of one wheel. The attacking party set four
Federal vessels on fire. The blockading fleet consisted of thirteen
vessels, with two first-class frigates. The Confederate gun-boats
returned to Charleston, where they were received with enthusiasm.
Commander Ingraham officially reported that the blockading fleet had
gone out of sight. General Beauregard then issued a proclamation
reciting the discomfiture and dispersion of the hostile fleet, and
formally declaring that the blockade of Charleston by the United
States was raised on and after the 31st of January. The General placed
steamers at the disposal of the foreign Consuls to see for themselves
that no blockade existed. The British Consul went on board the
steamer Petrel, five miles beyond the usual anchorage of the
blockaders, but could see nothing of them with glasses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, four vessels of the Federal fleet reappeared
late on the evening of the 31st, and on Feb. 1 twenty blockading
vessels were off Charleston bar.</p>

<p>The Confederate Secretary of State has notified to the British
and French Consuls the raising of the Charleston blockade.</p>

<p>The Southern journals announce that the Federal gun-boat P. Smith,
carrying eleven guns and 230 men, surrendered unconditionally to the
Confederates at Stone River, The Federal Navy Department had received
a despatch announcing that her capture ensued upon her running
ashore.</p>

<p>The British steamer Princess Royal was captured by a fleet of Union
gun-boats while attempting to run the blockade into Charleston with
a valuable cargo from Halifax. She had onboard six hundred barrels of
powder, two Armstrong guns, a large lot of machinery, sheet
iron, steam-batteries, hardware, boots, coffee, tin, and other
valuables. A party of English workmen skilled in the manufacture of
projectiles were also captured in the Princess Royal.</p>

<p>There are contradictory reports of the result of the expedition up
the Ogechee River, in Georgia. Southern reports state that the
ironclad Montauk was badly injured in her turret by the guns of
Fort M'Allister and compelled to haul off. The Federal Navy Department states
that the Montauk remained four hours under fire without receiving

<p>General Magruder officially announces on the 4th inst. that
Galveston was open to trade; but Federal Commodore Bell has issued a

<p>The bombardment of Galveston by the Federels had commenced, but the result is not yet known.</p>

<p>General Grant had arrived at Vicksburg. The works on the canal were
progressing. The Confederates have planted a battery commanding the
lower end of the canal.</p>

<p>Colonel Stewart, chief of the cavalry on General M'Clernand's staff
at Vicksburg, whilst out on a reconnaissance with two hundred men, was
shot and deserted by them. Colonel Stewart had upon his person a
memorandum-book containing full estimates of the number and calibre of
the forces and guns of Generals Sherman and M'Clernand, and much useful
information, including projects respecting canals, upon which work has
been commenced. This book fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Confederates have attacked Fort Donnelson and captured a
battery, afterwards regained by the Federals, who repulsed the
Confederates with heavy loss.</p>

<p>From the Cumberland River, Tennessee, further atrocities committed on
unarmed negro and mulatto men are reported. The coloured cabin-boys
and cooks captured on board some Federal steamers taken at Harpeth
Shoals, in the Cumberland River, were taken to an open field and shot
in cold blood. Two others got down by the rudder of the steamer and
held on with only their heads above water. They were discovered by the
Confederates and several soldiers were ordered into a skiff, who rowed
close up to them and blew out their brains. The life of a chambermaid
was saved with difficulty by the clerk of the steamer claiming her as
his slave when he was removing into Kentucky.</p>

<p>The surviving officers and crew of the Federal steamer Hatteras,
sunk off Galveston, had been landed by the Alabama at Port Royal,
Jamaica. It appears, however, that the Hatteras sank so quickly that
forty-three of her crew were drowned before they could be removed.</p>

<p>The report of the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury has been
published. The receipts for the year 1862 were 457,855,704 dols., and
the expenditure 416,917,735 dols., leaving a balance of over
40,000,000 dols. The expenses for the War Department were 340,000,000
dols., and for the Navy 20,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>The Governor of North Carolina is acting upon those principles of
State rights on which the Confederate Government is founded. He
insisted on the recall of a number of the State troops from Richmond
to protect the State. This demand has induced President Davis to have
an interview with the refractory Governor, in order to persuade him to
bring his policy into harmony with that of the Richmond
Government.</p>

<p>The military commanders of Georgia, and the Governors of North

left to the President's discretion. No slaves of loyal owners are to
be thus employed. No recruiting-offices are to be opened in Delaware,
Maryland, Western Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, or Tennessee, without
the permission of the Governors of those States. Their rations,

  GENERAL J. P1. B, STOART.

Tcrx accompanying Portrait of the dashing cavalry officer', General Stuart-the Mui'at of the Confederates; their Prince Bupert, with more than that Prime's sexes -cannot fool to be of interest to our readers. It is from a Sketch by our Special Artist in the Confederate camp, Northern Virginia, to which General Stuart as attached. Appended are come remarks respecting the General by the Richmond correspondent of the Times:-" While in the Shenandoah Valley the achievements of General Jackson have aroused towards him a generous fooling of gratitude for danger averted and prosperity preserved

it is doubtful whether east of the Blue Ridge the twenty-nine years of General Stuart, added to that indefatigable energy which beaches him, after he has ridden fifty miles during the dat, to regard it as his highest happiness to ride a aozen more miles at night 'to trend but one measure' in a Virginian country-house, do not incline the scale, especially if the balance be adjusted by fair hands, in favour of the younger General. There have been many EngiISh officers, particularly in the East Indian service, whose endurance in the saddle j

been regarded as unequalled; but I doubt whether

any Englishman ever exhibited such superiority to

bodily fatigue as is almost nightly evinced by the gay cavalier who knows every hospitable roof within a dozen miles of his head-quarters (and what roof is not hospitable ?), and, accompanied by his banjoplayer, visits them ly turns night after night, returning usually to his hacd-erned rest long after, the midnight hour has flown. With the earliest dawn of morning the first voice calling gaily for breakfast is that of the midnight merrymaker, who vises the picture of health, gcodhuniour, and strength. It maybe noticod en passant that to the circumstance that he has never touched tobacco in any form, or any wine 0Ѡother liquors General Stuart attrib,jfies much of his health and vigour Certainly so jovial a company as is assembled at General Stuart's headquarters it has never been my fortune to see pa.. lelledin either the Federal or the Confederate oainpe."

 In the Times of Tuesday appeared a letter from its special correspondent at the head-quarters of General Stuart, near h'cedsrickeburg, Virginia, dated dan. 1, containing an account of another of Stuart's raids dfwhiohsomepartiocilarehadpre'a'joualyronchedue

"The returcithis evening of General Stuart and his

staff has shed a glow of cheerfulness throughout the

camp, and has afforded much merriment by reason of the incidents which accompanied this expedition, and of which every one is talking, It appears that General Stuart started upon Christmas Eve with a considerable force of cavalry an the direction of Dunifries, distant about thirty miles from thsee head-quarters. Thence he proceeded towards 0oco

Creek, where, as well as at Dumfries, he had uirualohes with the enemy, during which he took about 200 prisoners, and inflicted some loss upon them, himself sustaining the loss of only one man, Captain Bullock (a very gallant officer), who, it is feared, was mortally wounded, Miss, crossing Ooooqusn Creek, General Stuart struck the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and at Burke's stationi

The luckless telegraph operator and his follow-prisoners--all of them dismounted cavalry soldiers--won started off on foot to walk forty-five miles to Ocilpepper station, in order that they might learn by practical experience what a. long and weary travel was requisite to carry thorn to that Richmond which they have been solong jzireaching.

WIDOR, .SATU.11D47, FEBRUARY 21, 1863.

Dronarras was held to have played the part of a wise and honest citizen when, the city being in a state of general excitement, he rolled his tub about in a vehement manner, and, being questioned as to his object, said that it did not become a man to be quiet when every one else was in agitation. But his conduct would have been less philosophical had the cynic performed his acrobatic feat simply because there was a great ,disturbance in some city a hundred miles off. And heroin is

placed at the bead of the federal provinces of America, the sudden and foolish intervention is an act of presumption which deserves severer language. The Crown, the Legislature, and all the classes whence springs what is really public opinion, have solemnly and repeatedly declared that we will not interfere. Arid until the North was reduced to a conviction that it must shortly give in, and that peace must be signed, there was no attempt to violate the agreement which we had all made. Now, while the respectable pert of the Americans themselves are busily devising schemes for ending the war without loss of honour, great crowds of Englishmen are brought together and are asked to join in a great shout to Mr. Lincoln to go on with the slaughter. It is, therefore, to be desired that dispassionate journals should assure both Europe and America that such manifestations, however loud may be the talk and however dense may he the gathering, have no real significance. The educated classes and the mass of the people are alike opposed to such impertinence. The nothingness of the leaden of the new agitation is, of course, notorious to English readers; but we may, with advantage, assure other persons that there is no one who takes the lead in these scenes who has the slightest claim to any other distinction.

 At the same time it is right to add that, though foolish persons have permitted themselves to be excited into a rather remarkable display of folly, and are rolling their tubs when there is not the least occasion for such gymnastics, there is a certain extenuation of their conduct to be found in the fact that others have gone much too far in defence of the South. There have been promulgated a great many doctrines on the side of the Confederates which by no means express the sentiments of this country. We never for a single moment tolerate slavery as an institution to be preserved. We go no further than to accept it as a fact to be dealt with wisely and humanely. It was accepted as such a fact by our own Legislature when it was resolved to terminate the system, and when the present Earl of Derby had allotted to him the noble task which he discharged so well. We wish to see slavery extinct in American as in English territory; but we have never been so cruelly unjust to our American brethren as to insist that they should run where we only walked. We took time-many years-to arrange our plans; we spread emancipation over a long period of apprenticeship, and we provided large funds for compensating those whom we had permitted to believe themselves in possession of "property." Nor bave we ever ventured to cell upon the South to go faster. We have indeed recognised the peculiar reasons why the action of the South in this matter must be slower than our own. This, however, is as far as we have gone in our toleration of slavery, and those who would go further, and contend for it as an institution to be conserved instead of an affliction to be endured, do not speak the sentiments of Englishmen. Mr. Teuuysou has told us eloquently of "the falsehood of extremes;" and one extreme begets another. The wise man is not irritated into exaggerations on one side because an opponent exaggerates on the other; but the judicial faculty is not a common one, and certainly it would not be a point of wisdom to expect the exercise of such a faculty from those who bawl and groan in Exeter Hall, which, as Lord Macmalay said, bath brayed. Still, we desire to note that there has been some provocation for the outcry, and it will be well that such provocation should cease. The South will, probably, ere long be a nation, and will exchange diplomatic communications with the Foreign Office. There is every reason why such intercourse should not be impeded by foolish declarations on one side or the other at home. We shall meet the South on facts, not on opinions. Brazil is a slave State, but (except when Earl Russell loses his head) we communicate amicably with Brazil, and yet we are so far from recognising the desirability of her domestic institution that we sink her slavers whenever we cannot seize them. The Southern Confederacy must prepare herself for similar treatment. On the other hand, we shall congratulate the North on not being a slave State; and, possibly, we shall suggest to her to give a lively colour to her professions by treating "niggers" a little hotter than she seems at all inclined to do at present.

We have deemed it right to say this because the ILLUSTRATED Losnoce Nssws makes its way into every part of the civilised world, and is read where the ordinary journal of a foreign nation is neither seen nor cared for. We desire
the difference between the, Greek sage and certain English sages who are jest now rolling their fobs furiously because the United States are in permrbation. There is no necessity for such a demonstration, and consequently it becomes ludicrous instead of imposing, or even respectable.

Were there any question at issue upon which the opinion of England was asked, there would be a reason for the meetings and orations which a numerous but not an influential class is now assembling and emitting. But what call is there upon England to interfere in the American quarrel? Has it not been the great praise of the Government that it expressed the views of the respectable and thinking portion of the population

by declaring at the outset, and by reiterating the declaration, I even from the Throne itself, that we had nothing to do with the struggle? Why, at the eleventh hour, and when there is every chance of the Americans adjusting the matter in their own way, by bringing a disastrous war to an end and allowingthe South to go freearethousands of Englishmen to be suddenly calledtogether to lend what moral aid they can to one side by declaring that they hate slavery? Do we not all hate slavery? Has not the nation made the greatest sacrifices in proof of that hatred, that in 1863 we should require Exeter Hall certificates to our character? [f these meetings and. spoutings are simply intended to place the English nation right in the eyes o

the world upon the subject of slavery they are needless and impertinent but if, as would seem to be the ease, they are designed to bolster up the unlucky ex-attorney who has been placed at the head of the federal provinces of America, the sudden and foolish intervention is au act of presumption which deserves severer language. The Crown, the Legislature, and all the classes whence springs what is really public opinion, have solemnly and repeatedly declared that we will not interfere.

- And until the North was reduced to a conviction that it must shortly give in, and that peace must be signed, there was no attempt to violate the agreement which we had all made. Now, while the respectable part of the Americans themselves are busily devising schemes for ending the war without loss of honour, great crowds of Englishmen are brought together and are asked to join in a great shout to Mr. Lincoln to go on with the slaughter. it is, therefore, to be desired that dispassionate journals should assure both Europe and America that such manifestations, however loud may be the talk and however dense may he the gathering, have no real significance.

1. new agitation is. of course, notorious to English readers; but we may, with advantage, assure other persons that there is no one who takes the lead in these scenes who has the slightest claim to any other distinction.

that a dispassionate tatemont of the real feeling of the people f England should go forth to those who may look for such a statement in vain in the columns of pasty strife. In brief, the

sac is this. England hates slavery as strongly as ever; but he loves fair play, and is not such a Phaѩsee as to pretend to more virtue than she has shown, or to demand that a slave itate should move faster than she herself moved.
