<p>And here it becomes necessary to infuse into our domestic chronicle
a foreign element. The disruption of the United States of America in
the spring, and the consequent civil war, has had an obvious bearing
on our interests and our policy. The path of neutrality and of
non-interference has been a narrow and a difficult one for our
statesmen to tread, owing to circumstances over which England has no
control, and to which we do not think it necessary now to do more than
allude. Unhappily, the affair of the Trent has left us in such a
position that on the first day of the new year we were anxiously
awaiting intelligence which would bear with it the issues of peace or
war with a kindred people. At this point it will not be out of place
to advert to the attitude which France has adopted towards this
country, one of loyal alliance and coincidence of opinion, which,
spontaneously expressed, has been followed by Austria and Prussia,
and, therefore, may be said to have gained the acceptance of the
majority of the Great Powers of Europe. Nor should we pass over the
remarkable signs which are apparent of a new era in the administration
of the affairs of France, taking a direction which can be traced to
the insensible influence of England; while the expansion of our trade
with our nearest neighbour, owing to the recent arrangements between
the two countries, has been such as to promise almost to compensate
for the, we trust temporary, loss of our commercial dealings wit 
h America.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Africa we have news from New York to the 10th
ult. This steamer was detained for thirty-six hours by Lord Lyons in
order to take out dispatches [sic].</p>

<p rend="center">HOW THE NEWS FROM EUROPE WAS RECEIVED.</p>

<p>The steam-ship Europa arrived at Halifax on the morning of Sunday,
Dec. 15, bringing European advices to Dec. 2. A very full summary of
the opinions of the English press on the Mason end Slidell case, and
the important decision of the British Government as well as the
opinion of the law officers of the Crown, was telegraphed to New York
and Washington, where the news was received on Sunday afternoon. No
journals were published, however, on Sunday; but the nature of the
news gained currency through private circles, and caused intense
excitement-the more so as the previous advices per Hansa had led the
public to believe that there would be no difficulty with England on
this question.</p>
<p>A full telegraphic summary was published in the American journals
of Monday, Dec. 16, and the Mason and Slidell case became the
absorbing topic of the day. The press and the public generally seem to
deprecate war with England, and to cling to a vague idea that the
matter would be settled by some diplomatic arrangement. Unanimity at
first, however, appeared to prevail among the press and public upon
the most important part of the question-namely, the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and the universal opinion was that the
"national honour" of the country could never permit the surrender of
the prisoners under any circumstances whatever.</p>
<p>The following day, Dec. 17, the feeling universally was much calmer
and quieter throughout all circles, and the general opinion was that
war would certainly not ensue; the idea of giving up Messrs. Mason and
Slidell was even discussed, and its probability entertained, the
argument being, if the Federal Government was in the wrong in taking
these men, there is no disgrace in surrendering them; and if they were
right, the questioncan be discussed or settled by arbitration.</p>
<p>The Europa's mails were delivered in New York Dec. 18, and their
contents closely scrutinized[sic]. Captain Seymour, Queen's messenger,
and Mr. Cooke, messenger from Mr. Adams, arrived in New York on the
morning of Dec. 18, and at once left for Washington by special train,
where they arrived at midnight.</p>
<p>The tone of the New York morning journals of Dec. 18 was materially
changed on the Mason and Slidell question, and a degree of moderation
was observable in discussing the subject very different from the articles of the few previous weeks.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th news from England to Dec. 6 was
telegraphed from Portland, and the announcement of the formidable
warlike progress being made in Great Britain again created great excitement.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EFFECT ON THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES.</p> 

<p>The bankers began to discuss the propriety of suspending cash
payments, and held a meeting immediately to come to a decision
thereupon. The New York Bank statement of the 16th showed that a large
decrease of their stock of specie (to the amount of nearly 5,000,000
dols.) had taken place, although there had been no shipments to
Europe. It was perceived that hoarding had commenced; nevertheless,
the banks of the three chief cities agreed to continue for the present
to meet their obligations in coin if demanded.</p>

<p>In the Stock Market there was a general fall of about three per
cent, and in some instances of from five to six per cent. Sterling
exchange rose to 111. In the Produce Market saltpetre advanced to
15c. per pound; and at the public sales brimstone, tea, and coffee
were withdrawn.</p>

<p>On the 18th Secretary Chase arrived in New York, and was closeted
with the bankers all day. What passed at the interview was studiously
concealed from the public except that Mr. Chase assured the bankers
that the demands of England would not be made an occasion of war by
the Cabinet of Washington.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Lord Lyons had not had any interview with the Secretary of State up
to the hour of the steamer's leaving; but the American Cabinet had had
several protracted sittings, the spirit of which, according to public
rumour, tended towards a peaceful settlement. It is observed that the
Ambassadors of England, France, and Prussia did not attend the
President's levee.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The proceedings of this body have been important, both in a
domestic and international point of view. Mr. Lovejoy's motion
censuring General Halleck for his order forbidding slaves to enter his
camp was defeated in the House by 78 against 64. This is regarded as a
triumph of the Administrative and Conservative Republicans over the
Emancipationists. In the Senate a motion to inquire into the conduct
of the Secretary of State in causing the arrest of persons in the
loyal States was defeated by 25 against 17. The bill to grant 1000
dols. to the owners of the British ship Perthshire, for wrongful
detention, was passed by the House. Mr. Cox, in introducing the
measure, said "that the prompt action of Congress in awarding it as
intended as an earnest to Great Britain that this Government will he
as earnest to indemnify for a wrong as to defend a right." On the
16th, Mr. Vallandingham, of Ohio, a pro-slavery Democrat, introduced
resolutions calling upon the President to maintain the stand already
taken in regard to Captain Wilke's action, and pledging to him the
full support of the House in vindicating the courage of the Government
and people of the United Stairs against a foreign Power. He moved the
previous question, but the resolutions were referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs by a vote of 109 against 16, the mover and his
seconders voting in the negative. Nothing has yet been done by either
House towards carrying out the recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury concerning the emission of a national currency in lieu of the
bank-notes now in use.</p> 

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federal armies have made no movement of importance during the
week. The popularity of M'Clellan is decidedly on the wane. Ship
Island, at the mouth of the Mississippi, has been occupied by the
Federals. Neither General Burnside's expedition nor that which has
been organized [sic] to descend the Mississippi had yet sailed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>A terrible fire had broken out in Charleston, attributed to negro
incendiarism. Five hundred and seventy-six building were consumed,
including a majority of the churches and public buildings. The loss is
set down at 7,000,000 dollars. The case has been brought before the
Confederate Congress by a special message from President Davis, and a
sum of 250,000 dollars appropriated to the relief of the sufferers.</p>

<p>In Nashville gold is at a premium of 40, and silver of 35, per cent.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>

<p>Public opinion in Canada supports the stand taken by the British
Government. The Canadian papers brought by the American mail are full
of military news. Preparations for war are being made on all hands,
and volunteering is being carried on with admirable spirit.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Renter's office
yesterday (Friday)</p>

<p> A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICA</hi>.-New York, Dec. 20,
Afternoon.-(Per Anglo-Saxon, vi&aacute; Portland and Londonderry.)A
battle is reported to have taken place in Missouri in which 1500
Confederates, finding themselves surrounded by the Federal forces,
surrendered with their baggage and equipments. Reports are current
that the Confederates have evacuated Galveston. 120,000lb. of
sea-island cotton have arrived at New York from Beaufort:
400,000lb. more are reported ready to be shipped. Vice-President
Stephens, of the Southern Confederacy, is said to be seriously
ill. The projected Federal expedition under General Villes from
Beaufort has been abandoned. A treaty between America and Mexico is
reported to have been subjected to Congress, by which the Federal
Government agrees to pay Mexico 11,000,000 dollars to refund the
British and French claims. Mexico is to grant America commercial
privileges and permission to transport troops across the Mexican
territory.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">OFF</hi>.-On Wednesday the emigration
officials at Liverpool issued their annual returns of the emigration
from that port during the past year. At the beginning of the present
year, and indeed up to May, there was every promise that the exodus
from this port would equal, if not surpass, that of any previous
year. In May, however, the American crisis assumed a serious aspect,
and the emigration all at once dropped off; and from that period up to
the present time there has been a regular and continued decrease, and
now the emigration trade of the port is at a complete
standstil1. Ships that formerly carried out their 500 to 700
passengers can now scarcely raise two dozen- indeed, brokers will
scarcely take the trouble of having a vessel surveyed by the
Emigration Commissioners, though the expense so trifling. The number
of vessels sailing under the Act, or Government supervision, and
number of passengers they carried, see as follows:-To the United
States, 139 vessels, of 220,213 tons burden, carried 1365 cabin and
26,212 steerage passengers; to Canada, seven vessels, 6720 tons,
carried 124 cabin and 1005 steerage passengers; to New South Wales,
two ships, 2344 tons, 526 steerage passengers; to Victoria, thirty
ships, 49,326 tons, 465 cabin and 9090 steerage passengers; to South
America, one ship, 287 tons, 8 cabin and 81 steerage passengers making
a total of 179 ships, and 38,879 passengers. Of ships not under the
Act, 348 carried to various parts of the world 6761 cabin and 9387
steerage passengers-16,148 passengers in all. Thus the total number of
passengers sailing under the Act was 38,879; and not under the Act,
16,148: 55,027 in all. Of these, 11,591 were English; 20,343 Irish;
2071 Scotch: the remainder belonged to other countries. In 1860 there
sailed under the Act 255 ships, 381,650 tons, 2796 cabin passengers
and 65,487 steerage passengers, or 68,283 passengers. In the same year
there left 15,491 passengers "not under the Act." Another feature of
this enormous decrease is, that whereas in former years people made
remittances to this country in order to assist their friends "at home"
to emigrate to the States, affairs are now reversed, and money is
forwarded through agents to bring people from America. The tide of
emigration to Australia flows slowly but steadily, and has hardly
received any impetus from the deranged state of American affairs.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, 8ATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 4, 1862.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> events of the year having been
summarised [sic] in another part of our Impression, we have now to
complete the record by adding the latest news from the only part of
the world where events have at the moment a strong interest for
English readers. The arrival of the Africa places us in possession of
a large mass of details, which our contemporaries have sought to
arrange ingeniously, mosaic fashion, so as to present a picture of the
American mind with reference to the dispute with England. We do not
know, however, that the picture is a likeness, clever as is the
manipulation of material out of which it has been produced. The only
part which has, we think, been "reliably" (to use a vile word)
presented is that which indicates the surprise which has seized the
States at the attitude of this country. We have submitted so long, and
with such good-natured forbearance, to every caprice, whim, and
impertinence of our cousins that they had, not perhaps unreasonably,
concluded that we had lost sight of the truth that under some
circumstances patience ceases to be a virtue. We have shown, in
contradiction to the incessant allegations of the Transatlantic press,
that we did, understand America and the nature of American
institutions; and that, though ourselves working with a responsible
Government, mutually dependent, and resting on the opinion of the
intellectual and solvent classes of society, we could make all
allowances for the difficult position of a Government under the
dictation of mobs, and abandoned by the culpable selfishness of the
respectable population. But the last outrage has been so flagrant that
not only is England aroused, but all the strong Governments of
Europe-some of them little inclined to be friendly to us- exclaim with
united voice that such a thing cannot be borne; and the intimation of
Earl Russell that there is a limit to our forbearance, though such
notification was a matter of indisputable necessity, has astonished
the Americans. The various utterances of the journals are not worth
collecting, except in so far as they reflect the opinion of the
peoples or may be supposed to be acceptable to it. The better men in
the States are said to have recognized [sic] the justice of our
demand, the Commander of the Army (at whom the Democratic party is
said to cast strange glances, as at a future Dictator who shall put
down the Abolitionists) having at once declared, it is alleged, that
Mr. Lincoln must restore the Commissioners and apologise [sic] to
England. But the formal delivery of the English demand would seem not
to have taken place when the Africa's bag was sealed. The Congress, so
ready the other day with a sycophantic compliment to Captain Wilks,
had refused by 109 to 16 to back up his "action" any further, and had
referred the question to the Government itself. Mr. Chase, the
American Gladstone, had assured the representatives of the financial
interest that the dispute would receive a speedy and pacific
solution. So far, therefore, things may be said to look a little
better; but it would be worse than foolish to augur that the danger of
war has passed away. We wish that we could believe the Seward party
wise enough and patriotic enough to consider the question only on its
merits. They have never given any proof of such a statesmanlike
disposition. They have sought nothing but popularity and the applause
of that part of the populace whose good opinion to a reproach to
honest men. Meantime they are being hard pressed by the Abolitionists,
who are more in earnest than any other section of the American public,
and who, naturally, are indignant that the slavery-hating Englishman
is placed in such a situation that he cannot sympathise [sic] with the
enemies of the slaveowner. It is hinted that the Abolitionists me much
more active hostility to the Government, and already the alarmists on
the Seward side threaten the severest reprisals. With such foes close
upon them, and with the discontent which the impatient mob is showing
at the prudential inactivity of General M'Clellan (there were idiots,
even in the London Common Council, who assailed Lord Wellington in the
same way for his unmatched Peninsular tactics), and with a fearful
expenditure to provide for out of an almost empty treasury, the
position of the divided and intriguing Cabinet of Mr. Lincoln is far
from enviable. This is to be much regretted, because the fact may make
it impossible for the President to do what justice and true wisdom
dictate in regard to England. He may feel himself obliged to make
political capital, and refuse to yield the men, at the risk of
bringing down prompt chastisement from the armed hand of England. A
brilliant victory over the South at this moment would be the best
guarantee for peace between us and the Americans-the national vanity
would be appeased and prudent counsels would have a chance of
prevailing. But there is small hope of anything of the kind; General
M'Clellan adheres to the Fabian system; and, though he counsels
justice, he takes no steps to do what alone would make justice
tolerated. In this, of course, we have no right to blame him. If his
own views of the future are such as are imputed to him-and if they are
he is far too wise a man to give any sign of the kind-he may not be
displeased to see the Government embarrassed by enemies whom it may be
his mission to put down. Thus the matter rests until fresh advices
arrive; and we repeat that the utmost that the last dispatches [sic]
permit us to say is, that the Americans are surprised at our energetic
protest against outrage, and seem inclined to consider that we may
have good grounds for action.</p>

<p>(<hi rend="smallcaps">From our Special Artist and
Correspondent</hi>.)</p>

<p rend="right">W<hi rend="smallcaps">ASHINGTON</hi>, Dec. 6.</p> 
<p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">FEW</hi> hours after dispatching my last
letter I heard of an act which had I known of sooner would probably
have induced me to suppress much that I had written favourable [sic]
to the Union cause. A people's conceit had been overlooked by me in my
belief in a principle, and I had smothered much of that feeling which
most Englishmen are prone to after a probationary course of American
arrogance. Anxious to do my duty to your readers, and honestly to
publish my convictions, I have never for a moment allowed myself to be
carried away by acrimoniousness, and personally I have heard much that
is bitter for an Englishman to hear. As I have said before, I have
looked upon the Union as a principle that should and ought to be
preserved-as an edifice, great and wonderful of its kind, built at the
cost of infinite intellect, wealth, and labour [sic]. Though the
architecture that has served for model in its construction may be
contrary to our notions of perfection, yet we cannot see a noble pile
destroyed without some feeling of compunction at its ruin. In this
spirit have my former letters been written.</p>
<p>Your readers are long before this aware that an English Royal Mail
steamer has been boarded by a United States' ship of war, and from
beneath the folds of the British flag four gentlemen belonging to the
"Southern Confederacy" have been forcibly removed. As to the legality
of this act I have nothing to say; it rests with the authorities on
international law to decide the question between the two Governments,
though as a subject of Great Britain I, with the captain of the Trent,
must protest against the violation of that flag which it is an
Englishman's creed to believe inviolable. But I have much to say in
reference to the bearing of the people of the Northern States since
they have been informed of this, according to their journals, "most
heroic achievement." It will make us all blush, when we turn back to
our chronicles of the sea, to find how utterly insignificant are the
deeds of our own naval commanders when compared to the brilliant
exploit of the Captain of the San Jacinto and her crew in boarding an
unarmed passenger-ship. I am not writing idly while giving utterance
to this sentiment. I am prompted to do so by the panegyrics pronounced
by one and all here on the deed which is to form "the brightest page
in contemporaneous history;" and, being in the minority, I must needs
bow deferentially to the opinions of the mass. But if, in the
minority, I might presume to express my own notions of what has been
done, I should suggest the idea that, if Captain Wilks be an honest,
true-hearted sailor, he must repudiate thoroughly, and with feelings
of something more than disgust, the vile and maudlin adulation of
those who would seek to magnify into Nelsonian proportions an event
which he, probably, estimating at its proper value, would soon have
forgotten. I am not going to quarrel with Captain Wilks for placing
himself in the position which has elevated him, through the absurdity
of his countrymen to the somewhat ludicrous pedestal on which he finds
himself. He no doubt considered he was doing his duty; and it remains
for Crown lawyers and other learned authorities to determine whether
he has done so or not.</p>
<p>When the first intelligence reached here of the capture of Slidell
and Mason, with their secretaries, the public excitement was greater
than anything I have witnessed throughout my experience of the
campaign. The arguments at the American Bar (rooms) went fast and
furious; the <hi rend="smallcaps">pros and cons</hi> (few of the
latter) were bandied from one stump orator to another, and most of the
discussions ended in any amount of smashes (brandy-smashes, I mean),
while numerous skins (whisky skins) were roughly handled by judge and
jury. "Waal [sic] now, Mister, I guess that the overhauling of that
thaar [sic] Britisher[sic] is a big thing anyhow, and I'll be dogged
if Cap'n Wilks ain't been right smart to lay a hand on them skunks"
(meaning the Southern Commissioners). This opinion was of course
received with unanimous applause, when another gentleman moved "That
now Uncle Sam had got'em [sic] in his fist he should squeege'em [sic]
pretty tight, and not mind nary international laws." Amongst the
better classes the feeling is just as strong in favour [sic] of what
has been done, and I have heard persons of consideration say that they
would rather see Slidell and Mason hanged in the face of an English
fleet than have them given up should international treaties place
England in position to demand their surrender. But the other day I
overheard the following conversation in reference to the possible
recognition of the South, and the probable demand of England for
reparation to her flag:--"Now, just look here: can't Pennsylvania
raise 800,000 men?" "Well, she can whip France, and I reckon New York
can fix England, and tother[sic] States can easily whip the South."</p>
<p>There is hardly a corporation in New York or Boston that has not
given a public reception to Captain Wilks. City halls have been turned
into josshouses[sic], and the guest has been made the joss before whom
all have bent in wondering admiration. Historical societies have
thrown wide their portals, their members have assembled in solemn
conclave to welcome to their midst the hero of the hour, and with the
leaves of their ponderous tomes spread open, and goose-quills neatly
nibbed[sic], they have told the rough seaman that such men as he made
history, and that theirs was the task in the present instance of
inscribing one of the brightest pages in the chronicles of
centuries. Can the momentous drama now being acted in the New World be
so travestied? Can an intelligent people be duped by such mockeries
and not perceive their shallowness? The system of raising a golden
calf one day and falling prostrate in blind worship before it, then
breaking it to pieces the next because the prayers offered have not
been answered, is very much the fashion here just now. First we see
the veteran Scott removed from the high pinnacle beneath which
thousands chanted their hymns of praise. Numerous minor idols of
popular or political belief follow in his wake, while only latterly
Fremont the chosen has been summarily dismissed from his command to
make way for a successor whose career may be more short-lived
still. And, if the signs of the times may be accepted as an omen, "the
coming man, the modern Alexander, the young Napoleon," as journalists
have delighted to term M'Clellan, with oceans of other adulatory
titles-he, too, has nearly run his course. Already strong parties are
sapping at the foundations of the pedestal on which he stands, and a
bitingly-sarcastic pamphlet has appeared bitterly attacking him for
his want of energy and the sluggishness of his movements. How long,
let me ask, will Captain Wilkes maintain his position in the niche
which he at present occupies in the Walhalla of Northern heroes? Well,
in the discussions that have been created by this all-absorbing topic
of Slidell and Mason, much has been elicited that is antagonistic to
England; and I, who have been a strong partisan of the North, lament
that it should be so. The arrogance and selfishness of those whose
cause in my Lilipntian manner I had espoused has been portrayed as I
never saw it before, and I feel I have only been doing my duty in
expressing myself as strongly as I have.</p>
<p>With regard to the conduct of the war I can say but little; matters
on the Potomac remain nearly in statu[sic] quo, The vast accumulation
of troops, much better drilled and disciplined then they were, are
lying idle within their lines, though it is impossible to say whether
they will go into winter quarters where they are or advance. With the
exception of a few reconnaissances, no movement whatever has taken
place, and this torpid condition of matters is raising a great outcry
throughout the North; the capitalists who have been furnishing
Government with funds expressing loudest of all their discontent. It
appears to me that the plan of the Cabinet is to operate on the
Southern seaboard by means of naval expeditions, and I suspect they
hope to draw off from the centre the troops of the Carolinas,
Louisiana, &amp;c., for the protection of their various States. The
success of such strategy would have the effect of weakening the
Confederate forces at Centreville and Manassas, where it is reported
they have an army of over 70,000 men, strongly intrenched[sic], and
perhaps enable M'Clellan to make a dash towards Richmond. However this
may be, I am getting tired of this continual "Wait another week and
you will see something done,' which I am constantly being told by
officers high in command. At present I am almost at a standstill for
subjects for illustration, and I shall have shortly, in case of
nothing transpiring here, to look around me seriously for another
field. The only persons who appear to me to display any amount of
activity are the greedy hordes of hungry contractors, who are
determined to have their pound of flesh from the sorely-pressed
Union. They flock here in myriads, and it was only last evening that I
had pointed out to me a gentleman with a gracefully-curved proboscis
who, by a lucky stroke of "Pishness, my tears," had succeeded in
bagging a hundred thousand dollars of the public money.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> is necessary to preface the following
catalogue of the principal international questions which engaged the
attention of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States
from 1814 to 1861 by observing that the object of the editor is not
the base one of further inflaming the public mind against the United
States' Government and people, but the simple and legitimate one of
affording desirable and seasonable information to the readers of this
Journal. In order, further, to guard against the possibility of
misconstruction, we beg to draw attention to three facts-first, that
the seceded States are equally responsible with the loyal States for
the past policy of the United States, be it good or evil; secondly,
that the present Administration and Congress of the United States are
substantially revolutionised organisations which ought not in equity
to be held too strictly accountable for the misdeeds of a past with
which they do not, in many respects, desire to be identified; and,
thirdly, that the great mass of the party now in power in the United
States consists of those, or the sons of those, who in former times
have loyally striven to preserve peace between the two countries, and
without whose co-operation that peace could never have been so long
preserved unbroken. If, on the present occasion, the conduct of the
Republican Administration and Senate on this their first trial only
rises to a level with the maxims of the extinct Federalist and Whig
parties, whose political heirs they are, there is no danger of the
affair of the Trent being allowed to drift into the last extremity of
war.</p>
<p> In 1817 General Jackson, of Tennessee, warring against the
Seminole Indians in Georgia and Alabama, marched into Florida, then a
Spanish possession, without declaring war, seized two Indian traders
named Arbuthnot, a Scotchman, and Ambrister, an Englishman, whom he
accused of inciting the Indians to hostilities, and tried them by a
court-martial, which sentenced the former to imprisonment, the latter
to death. General Jackson took upon himself the responsibility of
executing both. The Marquis of Lansdown, at the opening of the Session
in 1819, brought the subject before the House of Lords, and
stigmatised the act as "one of those naked acts of violence which
disgraced those by whom it was committed." Lord Liverpool stated in
reply that the execution took place without the authority of the
American Government, and that the act was not such as necessitated a
demand for reparation, the refusal of which would necessarily bring on
a war between the two countries. The action of General Jackson in
overruling the milder sentence of the court-martial could not, he
said, be spoken of without horror. No more notice was taken of the
event in Parliament; but the Opposition party in Congress loudly
condemned the conduct of General Jackson. It is a little singular that
this outrage, which is narrated in every school history in the United
States, where the unfortunate victims figure as "English emissaries,"
is not even alluded to either in our "Annual Register," "Knight's
Pictorial History of England," or Miss Martineau's "Thirty Years'
Peace."</p>
<p>In 1818 a commercial treaty was made between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In 1828 President Monroe and Mr. Canning co-operated in securing
the independence of the revolted Spanish American colonies. It was on
this occasion that the celebrated "Monroe doctrine," directed against
European interference on the American continent was first broached.</p>
<p>In 1887 the Canadian rebellion broke out and engendered a plentiful
crop of troubles. American "sympathisers" on the northern frontier,
after robbing the United States' Arsenal at Buffalo of its store of
arms, crossed the border and joined themselves to the rebels. A party
of them took possession of Navy Island, in the Niagara River, two
miles above the Falls, and within the jurisdiction of Canada. They
were supplied by a small steamer called the Carolina. One night a
party of Canadian militia, under the command of Sir Allan M'Nab,
crossed the river, cut the Caroline from her moorings in American
waters, set her afire, and let her float down the Falls. An American
citizen, named Durfee, shared the fate of the Caroline; and public
opinion in many quarters called on President Van Buren to declare war
against Great Britain; but wiser counsels prevailed. No reparation was
ever made for this act.</p>
<p>In 1840 this affair was the parent of another singular
complication. Alexander M'Leod, a loyal Irishman, while in a tavern at
Lockport, in the State of New York, made a foolish boast to the effect
that he was one of the party engaged in cutting out the Caroline. A
mob arrested him and threw him into gaol on the charge of aiding in
the murder of Durfee. The British Minister at Washington protested
against this act of the mob, declaring the operation to have been
effected in obedience to the colonial authorities, and therefore an
international question, for which an individual engaged therein as a
soldier was not liable. The British Government assumed the
responsibility of the destruction of the Carolina, and demanded the
release of the prisoner. The local magistrates were about to release
him on bail, but a mob overawed them. A committee of the Federal House
of Representatives demanded that the man should be held. As the
Federal Government would not prosecute, the State of New York stepped
in and tried M'Leod for an offence against one of her
citizens. Fortunately there was unquestionable evidence of an alibi,
and a verdict of acquittal was procured.</p>
<p>For many years the disputed question of the North-Eastern or Maine
boundary had been a chronic source of trouble between the two
countries. Fortunately for the cause of peace, the Whig party
triumphed in the Presidential election of 1840, and the Administration
of President Harrison immediately addressed itself to the task of
settling this formidable difficulty. On the British side Lord Aberdeen
was actuated by similar feelings, and Lord Ashburton was sent over to
the United States charged with this special mission. He and
Mr. Webster, the then Secretary of State, negotiated a treaty
(ratified in 1842) which settled the boundary line as it stands at
present. There were parties on both sides who were discontented with
this negotiation. Lord Palmerston stigmatised it as "the Ashburton
Capitulation." In reply to analogous attacks in the United States
Senate, Mr. Webster produced a map with the boundary line marked in
the handwriting of George III, which proved he had made a good
bargain. His conduct in concealing this map from Lord Ashburton was
unfavourably commented on in England, though defended by the chiefs of
the Conservative party.</p>
<p>At the same time the treaty for the suppression of the African
slave trade was entered into. The "right of visit" was tacitly
allowed, and the Americans agreed to keep a squadron on the African
coast to guard against the abuse of the American flag.</p>
<p>The case of the Virginian brig Creole arose in October, 1841. While
this vessel was on its way from Norfolk to New Orleans, some slaves,
who formed part of the cargo, obtained possession of the ship, wounded
the captain and some of the crew, killed a passenger who owned some of
the slaves, aud[sic] carried the vessel into the British port of
Nassau, New Providence. Of the 123 slaves on board nineteen were
arrested, on the requisition of the American consul, on the charge of
mutiny and murder. The case against the negroes was pressed with zeal
by the Federal Government, but the law officers and law peers of Great
Britain were unanimous that there was no law by which the negroes
could be tried or detained. The nineteen prisoners were therefore set
free.</p>
<p>The Maine boundary question had hardly been settled when the Oregon
or North-Western boundary dispute acquired highly-dangerous
proportions. Even so early as 1822 Lord Castlereagh told the American
Minister in London that such was the condition of this question that
war could be kindled by holding up a finger. In 1818 an agreement had
been entered into opening the Oregon territory to the occupation of
settlers from both countries. On this footing things had remained
until 1844. The partisans of war sent out thither a numerous American
emigration, which greatly added to the difficulty of a peaceful
settlement. The American war party claimed the whole territory up to 5
4deg. 40 min.; and in the Presidential election of 1844 Mr. Polk, who
was pledged to enforce this claim by war, if necessary, was elected in
preference to Mr. Clay, the Whig candidate, who favoured a
compromise. Mr. Polk's Message in December, 1845, was substantially a
war message; but, thanks to the moderation of the Senate, where the
Whig and Southern Democratic senators acted in alliance, a compromise
was agreed to settling the line to the Pacific at 49 deg., and giving
the island of Vancouver to Great Britain. President Polk, in assenting
to this arrangement in 1846, threw the responsibility upon the
Senate.</p>
<p>In 1850 the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was made, about the true
construction of which a serious difference was to arise a few years
later.</p>
<p>In 1852 the Newfoundland fishery dispute broke out. Lord Derby's
Government sent instructions to the commanding Admiral to protect the
exclusive rights of the colonists within three marine miles of the
coasts of British North America, as provided for by the Treaty of
1818. The execution of these instructions caused great excitement in
the United States, which was increased by the inflammatory popular
speeches of Mr. Webster, then Secretary of State. American ships of
war were ordered to the spot end a collision was imminent.</p>
<p>The final settlement of this question was effected by the
Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, negotiated at Washington by Lord
Elgin. According to this arrangement the legislation affecting the
commerce between the United States and British America was altered in
a free-trade direction, the navigation of the St. Lawrence was opened
to American bottoms, and the exclusive right of shore-fishing was
abandoned.</p>
<p>In consequence of the filibustering expedition of Lopez against
Cuba, the Governments of Great Britain and France, in 1853, invited
the Government of the United States to enter into a tripartite treaty
to guarantee the possession of Cuba to the Spanish Crown. Mr. Everett,
then Secretary of State, refused to accede to the proposal.</p>
<p>In 1854 President Pierce, on some trifling pretext, ordered the
bombardment of Greytown, a city under the protection of Great
Britain. This act received the reprobation of the principal
Governments of the civilised world.</p>
<p>In 1856 the differences between Great Britain and the United States
on the Central American question came to a crisis. Under the
provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty the American Government
claimed that Great Britain was bound to surrender her possessions in
British Honduras, the Bay Islands, and the Mosquito Protectorate. Lord
Clarendon declined to accede to this interpretation, but offered to
abide by the award of a third party. To this the American Government
would not listen, and at the commencement of 1856 war seemed
imminent. Nevertheless, the American Government did not press its
requisitions to the point of war, and, after some fruitless attempts
to negotiate on a more moderate basis, this question has been settled
by the abandonment by Great Britain of the Mosquito Protectorate and
the Bay Islands, the former by treaty with the State of Nicaragua, the
latter by treaty with the State of Honduras.</p>
<p>In 1856 occurred the dismissal of the British Minister at
Washington (Mr. Crampton), on the false charge of having engaged in
the enlistment of soldiers for the British service on United States'
soil, Great Britain then being at war with Russia. On a similar charge
of breach of the neutrality laws three British Consuls had their
exequaturs withdrawn from them.</p>
<p>In the same year the resolutions of the Congress of Paris in
reference to maritime law were submitted to the United States
Government for adoption. The Administration of President Pierce
refused to assent to that article which abolished privateering, unless
a clause were added exempting private property from seizure at sea. To
this proposal the Government of Lord Palmerston refused to assent, and
it was afterwards withdrawn by Mr. Buchanan, the successor of
Mr. Pierce.</p>
<p>In the same year the United States' Government purchased of the
salvors the derelict British barque Resolute, of the Arctic
Expedition, equipped and refitted her, and sent her back to England.</p>
<p>During Mr. Buchanan's term of office, with the close of which this
resum&eacute; will terminate, but two points of difference arose. In
1858 the British Government, in the desire of stopping the slave trade
off the coast of Cuba, exercised "the right of visit" in the Gulf of
Mexico. This caused a unanimous burst of indignation from both the
great parties of the United States, and the practice was formally
abandoned by the British Government. All propositions for adopting
means by which the nationality of vessels suspected of being engaged
in the slave trade could be ascertained were rejected by the
Administration of Mr. Buchanan.</p>
<p>In the same year the Atlantic cable was laid, and messages of
mutual good will were exchanged between the Queen and the President
and the Mayors of London and New York.</p>
<p>In 1859 General Harney seized the island of St. Juan, the right to
which is claimed by both nations under the treaty relating to the
North-western boundary. This act of General Harney, being contrary to
an express understanding between the two Governments that neither
party should occupy the island until the right of possession had been
determined, led to a remonstrance by the British Governments. General
Scott was sent to the Pacific coast to overrule General Harney. The
affair terminated in the joint occupancy of the island, and in the
recall of the offending General.</p>
<p>In 1860, on the invitation of President Buchanan, the Prince of
Wales made a tour through the Northern and Western States. The
incidents of this memorable tour are still so fresh in the public mind
that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them. It will be a terrible irony
on the civilisation of the age, a standing reproach against human
nature, if this visit of reconciliation- which seemed to be a fitting
finale to a bitter and long-standing international feud- should, after
all, be nothing but a mocking prelude to a third war with the United
States- war so often imminent, yet, as we have seen, as often
avoided.</p>

<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">NEUMATIC</hi> P<hi
rend="smallcaps">ILE</hi>-B<hi
rend="smallcaps">RIDGE</hi>--Mr. C. C. Martin, the American engineer
who completed the Brooklyn Waterworks, carried on the erection of a
bridge across the Savannah River until interrupted by the civil
war. This bridge is on the line of the Charleston and Savannah
Railroad, about sixteen miles from the latter city. When completed, it
will consist of six fixed spans and a swing-bridge, with an aggregate
length of 900 feet. The two abutments and seven piers are to consist
of pneumatic piles-the abutments and four piers to be of two piles
each, the piers at the end of the swing-bridge to consist of four
cylinders each, and the pivot-pier of five. The cylinders are cast in
sections, nine feet in length and six feet outside diameter, with two
inches of metal. The apparatus for sinking these piles consists of a
large flat boat, upon which is placed a 16-horse power steam-engine,
and two double-acting air-pumps, hoisting apparatus, &c. In the <hi
rend="italic">Journal of the Franklin Institute</hi>, Philadelphia,
appears an interesting account of the process of sinking the
cylinders, with illustrative woodcuts. Two portions of cylinder are
made airtight by whitelead, and held in proper position by "guys,"
&amp;c. The pumps are set in action, and the cylinder sinks into the sand
(about six feet in three minutes) on the application of a vacuum. As
the process proceeds, a syphon pipe and other apparatus are
employed. When at last a stopcock is opened, and the compressed air is
allowed to escape suddenly, the upward pressure from within is removed
and the cylinder, by its own weight, forces itself deeply into the
sand. The amount of sand which enters the cylinder under the bottom
when the pressure is allowed to escape is astonishing. When a cylinder
sank less then a foot the sand rose inside it twenty-two feet (equal
to twenty-one cubic yards), which was brought in by the rushing water
in a few minutes. On one occasion, when the men were at work in a
cylinder, they suddenly heard a sound like the report of a cannon, and
all became as dark as night. The report was occasioned by the sudden
removal of the pressure from without, while within the air was
condensed. The darkness was occasioned by the rapid condensation of
the vapour held in invisible suspension in the condensed air, forming
a thick fog.</p>

<p>Although we believe that there was scarcely an Englishman whose
first and warmest feeling was not a determination to hold to the
honour of his country and the vindication of international rights, yet
it can hardly be supposed that any one amongst us was blind to the
sacrifices and the inevitable consequences which must follow a hostile
venture of any kind who did not recognise the truth of the saying that
peace is the happy, natural state of man, and that it were better that
she should be allowed still to go on achieving those victories which
are no less renowned than those of war. In short, the point on which
the fortunes, the events, and the happiness, more or less, of the new
year turned was our relations with the Federal States of America.</p>
<p>If to a certain extent we are still held in suspense in that
respect, there is now much, very much, to encourage the hope of a
pacific solution of a difficulty, the extent and importance of which
we in this country at least have never underrated. In the first
instance, as we all know, the matter in dispute did not strike on the
American mind with any sense of that real magnitude which has since
been somewhat more acknowledged. The palpable change in the feeling,
as we believe, which has come over the bulk of those whose influence
on the action of the Federal Government could probably not be
overrated seems to be the most natural thing in the world. The mind of
England was expressed with a unanimity, a directness, and a thorough
apprehension of the gravity of the question; the course of her
Majesty's Ministers was prompt, the deliberations of a single Cabinet
Council resulting in a special address to the Government of
Washington, the substance of which it was evident must be in
accordance with the voice of public opinion; and at once, and with an
activity which spoke well for the condition of our administrative
departments, preparations were made for any eventuality. The process
of reasoning amongst the Americans must have received its first
impulse from these facts; at least the notion that what had occurred
was a small matter involving no serious consequences must have been at
once disabused. Reaction, arising, not from anything which could be
construed into timidity, but from an appreciation of<pb n="34"/> the
importance of the issue, may reasonably be supposed to have even then
commenced in the States. But when it was ascertained that first and
foremost France, then Prussia, then Austria, and, as it is said, even
Russia, spontaneously expressed opinions that, on principles of
international law, the affair of the Trent cannot be justified, it was
hardly to be conceived that a nation which the leading Powers of the
civilised world in combination declare to be in the wrong could
persist in backing up its error even at the cost of a war, which to
call disastrous would be employing a very feeble phrase indeed. There
never was a situation in which a great people could afford to act
gracefully and to bend, with no loss of honour, before an acknowledged
law of society. It seems to us that it would have been mere frenzy in
the Americans to stick to a quarrel which, in universal international
opinion, is deficient in that element of justice which, did it exist,
would thrice arm those who espouse it. To the petulant outbreaks on
this question of the professors of "bunkum" which some of the latest
accounts tell us have not been wanting, even in the comparatively
sedate discussions of the Senate, we attached little weight, for we
believed they were no longer in accordance with the feeling of the
American people at large; and, if the matter in dispute has been
settled with less graciousness than might be desired, it will be owing
to some such ruder spirits as those who have recently made
uncompromising motions in Congress with a want of success which is in
itself not a little significant.</p>
<p>Happily we are able to say that the first great cause which must
have influenced the destinies of the twelve months into which we have
just entered has been removed; that there will be no war...</p>
<p>As we set out, so we conclude, that, when we looked forward to the
new year, much, if not all, of its happiness depended on the news we
were awaiting from our kindred in the West. Now that we know that
there is to be peace between us, we do not reflect with anything but
satisfaction on the course which this country adopted, and we think
with equal pleasure on the course which has been adopted by the
American Government.</p>

from New York to the 28th ult. The City of Washington's advices had
previously relieved us of our painful suspense as to the issue of
peace or war.</p>

<p>SURRENDER OF MESSRS MASON AND SLIDELL.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons received his despatches early on the 19th ult., and had
several unofficial interviews with Mr. Seward, at which the demands of
the British Government were made known to the American Secretary, but
not formally delivered. Mr. Seward met Lord Lyons in a friendly
manner, but entered into no conversation with him on the points
involved. It was not till the 23rd that Lord Lyons formally presented
the demands of the British Government to Mr. Seward, who received a
copy of Earl Russell's despatch.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons informed Mr. Seward that he would wait till the 30th for
a reply.</p>
<p>On the 25th M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington,
presented M. Thouvenel's letter to Mr. Seward, and on the 27th, three
days before the expiration of the term granted by Lord Lyons,
Mr. Seward conceded the demands made by Earl Russell.</p>
<p>After coming to this resolution the American Administration
immediately published the correspondence, in order, probably, to
justify its course in the eyes of Congress and public opinion. The
Jura brings the following summary thereof:-</p>
<p>The correspondence commences with a despatch from Mr. Seward to
Mr. Adams in London, dcelaring that Captain Wilks acted without
instructions, and hoping that the British Government would consider
the subject in a friendly temper. Mr. Seward says also that the
British Government may expect the best disposition on the part of the
Federal Government.</p>
<p>The next despatch is from Earl Russell to Lord Lyons, stating the
outrage on the British flag, and hoping that the act was committed
without instructions from the Federal Government, as that Government
must be aware that Great Britain cannot allow such an affront to pass
without reparation. Earl Russell expresses a hope that the Federal
Government will offer suitable redress by giving up the four prisoners
to Lord Lyons.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward replied that the English Government rightly conjectured
that the act was without the authority or knowledge of the Federal
Government. He trusts that England will see that the Federal
Government neither practised nor approved any deliberate wrong in the
transaction, and declares that Great Britain has a right to demand the
same reparation as the United States would expect from any friendly
nation in a similar case. Mr. Seward says he is aware that he argues
on the British side of the case; but in doing so he is only defending
American principles. He quotes the instructions from Mr. Madison,
Secretary of State in 1804, to Mr. Monroe, Minister to England, and
says, "If I decide this case in favour of my own Government I must
disallow its most cherished principles and for ever abandon its most
cherished policy; but the country cannot afford such a sacrifice. The
Government cannot deny the justice of England's claim." Mr. Seward, in
conclusion, states that the four prisoners are at the disposal of Lord
Lyons, and asks his Lordship to indicate a time and place for
receiving them.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons, in his reply, says he will forward Mr. Sewards
communication to the British Government, and will confer personally
with him in regard to the reception of the four gentlemen.</p>
<p>The note from M. Thouvenel to the French Minister on the Trent
affair is included in the correspondence.</p>
<p>On the 24th it was said on good authority that thus far only the
President and Secretary Seward had handled the question on the
American side, the last regular Cabinet meeting having been adjourned
by a note from Mr. Lincoln, to avoid the risk of a general and
premature discussion.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEBATE IN THE SENATE.</p>
<p>On the 26th Mr. Hale, a Republican Senator from New Hampshire,
demanded the correspondence with England on the Trent
question. Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Committee
of Foreign Affairs, objected to this demand.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale stated that he had heard the Cabinet were considering the
proposition to surrender Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said also he
would favour foreign arbitration; but, if England had demanded the
surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, the Federal Government should
declare War against England. "If they were surrendered, the Senate,"
said Mr. Hale, "would be subject to the scorn and indignation of the
country, and the Administration would be hurled from power." Mr. Hale
believed that Napoleon would desire to wipe out the stain of Waterloo,
and that thousands of Irishmen in Canada would join the Federal
cause. Mr. Hale concluded a violent speech against England by urging
war sooner then the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell.</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner urged that the consideration of the question should be
delayed until it was presented in a practical form. He denied that
there was proof of arrogant demands on the part of England, or that
the Administration had not considered the question of arbitration, and
stated his belief that the matter would be honourably and amicably
adjusted.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale's motion was tabled for future discussion.</p>
<p>On the 23rd the House of Representatives adjourn until the 2nd
instant.</p>

<p>The trade circular of Messrs. Neill Brothers forcibly describes the
transition of sentiment among this class:-</p>
<p>The first emotion when the news of that event became public in this
country was a mingled one of surprise and delight with the boldness
and the exploit and at finding such important enemies in Northern
custody, and of fear that the act was illegal and impossible to
maintain. Even the President himself admitted that the prisoners would
probably have to be given up. But forthwith the press of this country,
whose main policy is to charm their readers and increase their own
popularity by telling the public whatever they would like to hear,
devoted themselves heart and soul to the work of convincing themselves
and their readers that the act was perfectly legal, in accordance with
precedent, and especially with English decisions. It is easy to
convince those who wish to believe; and as all the argument was on one
side, with none to expose its fallacies, sophistries, and
misrepresentations, it is not surprising that the mass of the people
should have been speedily satisfied; and, being convinced as to the
legality of the act, neither was it surprising that among a people so
self-confident as to their power of judging correctly and so vain of
their military strength, a unanimous determination should be arrived
at and expressed not, under any circumstances, to part with the
prisoners. The mob desired to hold them, right or wrong; the more
respectable citizens determined to hold them because they had already
been so easily convinced it was right. . . . .Thus for a few days war
between Great Britain and the Northern States seemed almost
inevitable. But wer are happy to be able to inform you that during the
past three days there has been a most salutary and extraordinary
change in public sentiment here and<pb n="35"/> throughout the
country. It was to a great extent a game of brag, after all, and none
the less so that the people had deceived themselves quite as much, if
not more, than they deceived others..... Whereas, a week ago, nine out
of every ten men would tell you that England might threaten as she
pleased, but the prisoners would never be given up, now the balance of
opinion is quite the other way.....Upon a deliberate review of the
delicate, and apparently extremely hazardous, relations of this
country with Great Britain, we are inclined to believe war between the
two nations now more distant than we thought it before the present
complication arose. The American Government had for some time past
acted upon a presumption that England's interests in the preservation
of peace with them were so great that she would bear any number of
petty indignities rather than make them a cause of war. This idea will
now probably be modified, and there may be a little more of that
respect shown to British subjects which they are accustomed to receive
in other foreign countries, and fewer arrests of them without process
of law or opportunities fir[sic] their justification or defence.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEELING OF THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>The popular feeling in intensely hostile to England. Even those
journalists and others who urge the necessity of yielding in the
present instance do so, avowedly, from motives of expediency,
recording a vow meanwhile that henceforth England's difficulty shall
be America's opportunity. No passion less strong than that for
restoring the Union would, they say, allow them to consent to the
surrender of the captives. It is freely charged that the British
nation, in its desire for cotton and to dismember the Union, is only
seeking a pretext for a quarrel, and that they have taken advantage of
the momentary weakness of the United States to humiliate the latter to
the dust. It must be observed, however, that these lively expressions
of resentment were uttered before the despatches from the Continental
European Governments had been published.</p>

<p rend="center">A NEW DIFFICULTY.</p>
<p>The telegraph reports a new outrage on the British flag, apparently
similar to that of Commander Wilks. The Federal steamer Santiago de
Cuba overhauled, on the coastt of Texas, the schooner Eugenia Smith,
sailing under the British flag. She found nothing contraband on board,
but took from her deck two passengers, who, from the papers found upon
them, were supposed to be agents of the Confederate States. These
passengers, Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, had arrived at New York, and
been confined in Fort Lafayette. The telegram says that the schooner
was sailing between Matanzaosand Havannah, two Cuban ports; but for
Matanzas, Metamoras, a Mexican port, should probably be read.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TREATY WITH MEXICO.</p>
<p>A treaty between the United States and Mexico is reported to have
been submitted to Congress, by which the Federal Government agrees to
pay Mexico 11,000,000 dols, to refund the British and French
claims. Mexico is to grant the United States commercial privileges and
permission to transport across the Mexican territory.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>The harbour of Charleston has been destroyed, sixteen whaling hulks
filled with granite, having been sunk in three parallel lines
equidistant across the channel. The flow permitted to the water will
prevent the cutting of a new outlet, and the obstruction will soon
accumulate a triple line of sandbanks across the entrance.</p>
<p>A force of 1300 Confederates have surrendered themselves to the
Federal forces on Missouri, with their baggage and equipments.</p>
<p>There has also been a slight engagement at Drainsville, near
Leesburg, in Virginia, in which the Confederates, being overnumbered,
were forced to retire.</p>
<p>From Beaufort, South Carolina, the Federal forces have dispatched
to New York a cargo of 120,O00lb. of sea-island cotton, gathered by
the refugee negroes, and there were 400,000lb. more ready for shipment
by the next vessel.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
<p>Congress has raised the duty on tea to 20 cents per pound, on
coffee to 5 cents per pound; on sugar, 2 1-3, 3, 5, and 8 cents per
pound, according to quality, and on molasses to 6 cents per
gallon. These measures were in accordance with Mr. Chase's
recommendation. These duties came into force immediately, and apply to
all goods in warehouse.</p>
<p>Congress has appropriated 1,500,000 dollars for gun-boats on the
western lakes, and 1,200,000 dollars for the establishment of a naval
d&eacute;p&ocirc;t on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The New York banks have lost five million dollars in specie in a
fortnight, and the Sub-Treasury four millions; yet only about half a
million has left the country, although the rate of exchange gives a
profit on the export of specie to England. It is evident, therefore,
that hoarding has begun. Under those circumstances a suspension of
cash payments is considered to be imminent.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Abolitionist leader of Boston, had
delivered an address in favour of emancipation and against the
"reconstruction" of the Union, in the Cooper Institute, New York, to a
crowded audience, consisting of the &eacute;lite of the city.</p>
<p>At the annual dinner of the New England Society to commemorate the
landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, a letter from Mr. Seward was read,
dated Dec. 11, of which the following is the material portion:-</p>
<p>Dear Sir,-Pray present my apology to the sons of New England for
declining their invitation to the New England dinner. My duties here
allow me little enjoyment of the holidays. If it were an Old England
dinner instead of a New England feast I would certainly strain a point
to attend. I would like so good an opportunity to attempt to show to
our cousins across the seas that there is no material benefit or moral
influence that can accrue to us that will not also increase the
prosperity and greatness of Great Britain, and that every disaster
that befalls the United States is also pregnant with suffering and
sorrow sooner or later to be borne by Great Britain.</p>

<p>Thomas D'Arcy M'Gee, in a letter just published, declining to speak
at a festival of the New England Society, at Montreal, writes as
follows:-</p>
<p>"I declare most absolutely, and it is well that the opponents of
Canada should know in time, that the Irish inhabitants of this colony
will be found embattled as one man in defence of the Canadian
Constitution and the Imperial connection. There is hardly a group of
Irish settlers in Upper or Lower Canada that I have not personally
visited during the last four or five years. There is not a man of note
amongst them, layman or cleric, that I have not met: and I declare
that I have yet to meet the first man of all those bodies and orders
of men who does not frankly and loyally prefer our Canadian
Institutions to those of the United States. Formerly, I believe, it
was different with many among them (as I own it was some years ago
with myself); but since the era of 'the knownothing' movement the last
vestige of political preference for the United States has disappeared
among the Irish here."</p>

<p rend="center">ARRIVAL OF A FEDERAL WAR-STEAMER AT SOUTHAMPTON.-</p>
<p>A correspondent writes from Southampton on Wednesday evening as
follows:- "The Tuscarora, one of the new screw-corvettes built for the
Federal Navy, arrived in the river this afternoon, about half-past
three o'clock, from New York. She left that port on the 15th ult., and
had a very rough passage across the Atlantic, and put into Fayal for
coals, sailing thence eight days since. From Fayal she has had fine
weather. The Tuscarora is commanded by Captain T. Augustus Craven, and
her officers and crew number about 200 in all. She mounts nine heavy
guns, two of them the famous 11-inch columbiads (both on pivots), six
broadside guns, and a rifled Parrot gun on the forecastle. The
corvette is a smart-looking vessel, of 1200 tons burden, and barque
rigged. She is just built, and only arrived at New York from
Philadelphia on the 9th ult. It is understood that her mission in
these waters is specially to look after the Nashville, and generally
to protect the interests of Federal shipping. The Nashville remains in
dock, and her future movements are, of course, kept profoundly
secret. She is coaled and ready for sea; and it was rumoured this
morning that she was going out of dock during the day into the river;
but up to this time (five p.m.) she is lying quietly in her
berth. Whether she will now keep her quarters a close prisoner, keenly
watched by the Tuscarora, until the conflict is over, or whether, on
some favourable opportunity, she will venture to 'run the blockade'
and escape, time only can determine."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 11,
1862.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> dove has come and not the eagle. On
Wednesday evening a telegram from Lord Lyons was brought by the City
of Washington mail-steamer announcing that the act of Captain Wilks
was annulled by the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their
two secretaries. The relations between England and the Northern States
are, therefore, placed upon their former footing.</p>
<p>That Mr. Lincoln has performed this act of justice is
sufficient. In what way it has been done, what the document with which
Mr. Seward has accompanied the notification to Lord Lyons may be, what
the American journals may say, what indignation may be expressed by
mob meetings- are all considerations which may be set apart from the
main point. A Government has had the wisdom to do justice and to
repudiate, by deed if not by word, an outrage upon the flag of another
Government. It may be that the right thing has been done in the wrong
manner, and that there may be little cause for sentimental outbreak
upon the subject. But right has been done, and the horrors of war have
been averted; and in this there is surely enough to prompt the myriads
who will assemble to-morrow in the House of Prayer to offer grateful
thanksgivings to Him who " heareth and answereth prayer."</p>
<p>It would, at the same time, be an absurd affectation to pretend any
doubt as to the human means that have wrought this most desirable
issue. England has made at once an unmistakable manifestation of
feeling and a magnificent demonstration of power, and public opinion
and wise statesmanship have acted in unison. It was made clear to the
American Government that we should enforce our rights, and the
President has had the prudence to risk unpopularity for the hour
instead of encountering defeat and disgrace for his country. We do not
see that it is either necessary or generous to examine too closely the
reasons which he may offer to the excited people of America. If he
chooses to tell them that they are engaged in what has, up to the
present time, been an unsuccessful war, which is costing them a
million and a quarter of dollars every day, and that for the sake of
detaining four gentlemen in a State prison it was not worth while to
engage in a new contest, in which the overwhelming force of the most
powerful nation in the world, supported by the opinion of Europe,
would instantly be brought to bear upon the North, we have no right to
complain that he should take that line, instead of boldly declaring
that he unhesitatingly reversed a wrong. Mr. Seward's State paper, be
it what it may, has been framed rather for his own countrymen than for
England, and will in due course be answered, no doubt, by the terse
dialectics of the Foreign Office. Some of the journals will, of
course, be venomous, and will threaten us with signal chastisement
when the empire of the North shall be re-established and the South,
trampled, shall be unable to interfere. For this, and for the Greek
Kalends, we will wait patiently. The single point on which it is
possible that the good-hearted John Bull may feel he would like to
reply is the allegation that he made his demand "in the hour of
America's disasters and distress." This is altogether a brand-new
statement of the case. Six weeks ago we were solemnly and vauntfully
assured that America was exceedingly rich and powerful, and had nearly
three-quarters of a million of soldiers ready for anything. The South
was to be repressed the moment General M'Clellan should be ready to
move, and then the army of the North could move upon Canada, or
Ireland, or Yorkshire, if necessary. Therefore we had no right to know
anything about distress or disaster, and might consider ourselves as
doing a bold thing in asking the flushed and fiery champions of the
Union to surrender their prey. But, even supposing that the North were
unfavourably circumstanced, it could not justify her in doing a wrong
or us in submitting to one. It is not because a man is irritated and
upon bad terms with his wife and family that he is to be allowed to
rush into another man's house and carry off his property. We have,
however, made the demand for reparation in the most considerate way,
have done everything to conciliate, and, by means of a graceful and
informal piece of diplomacy, we left it open to Mr. Lincoln to seize
the opportunity of making an open to Mr. Lincoln to seize the
opportunity of making an unenforced atonement for a pirate's
action. We are therefore clear of all blame in the whole transaction,
and legally, morally, and even sentimentally, we have shown ourselves
friends to the Americans. When the storm shall have gone down this
will be admitted by all except the viler of the journals. It is said
that a man whose position may, at no distant date, be a far higher one
than is now supposed- the Commander of the American Army- has already
declared that England has acted rightly.</p>
<p>We must now wait details, but we wait in a far different attitude
from that in which we were to be found until Wednesday. We welcome the
dove, and Britannia throws down the lanyard, rejoiced that she is
spared the pain of a straggle with those for whom, despite all their
unkindness, she ever retains a warmer sympathy than she can feel for
any other nation in the world.</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MONG</hi> the Illustrations of the civil war
in America which, by means of our Special Artist in the Federal camp
on the Potomac, we have been enabled to give in this Journal, some
have been devoted to showing the queer punishments to which the
rowdies of the camp are subjected; and our Number for the 28th of
December last contained an Engraving of the drumming a loafing scamp
out of the Federal army. These, however, are common incidents in camp
life. The provost-marshal of the Alexandrian division has had to carry
out a severer sentence. On Dec. 13 a private in the Lincoln Cavalry,
named Johnson, was executed at Fairfax Seminary, near Washington, for
desertion. The execution took place before a large body of troops. As
the procession passed along, the doomed man was seated in a waggon,
and by his side was a Roman Catholic priest, who was giving to him the
last ministration of religion. He held open a prayer-book before the
prisoner, who, with his head bowed down, was attentively reciting a
prayer. When he had arrived at the place of execution he alighted from
the waggon and seated himself on the coffin. Twelve men, detailed to
execute the sentence, took their position about six paces in front. He
addressed a few words to them, stating that as fellow-soldiers he
hoped they would forgive him for having committed the offence he had,
and that they would not do as he had done. A few parting words were
given to his spiritual adviser and three or four officers, after which
he prepared himself to have the sentence executed. He was seated on
his coffin when the word was given to fire. Eight balls pierced
various parts of his body, but as he only showed a slight tremor the
reserve was ordered to fire, and four other shots were fired, one of
which entered his eye, and another his mouth, and he fell
dead.</p></div2>

Ramsgate, has turned up at Cadiz, where, with the officers and
crews-forty-two persons in all-of three Federal merchant-vessels which

<p>To our inexpressible relief and gratification we were able to
announce in our last Number that the Government at Washington had
definitively acquiesced in the claim made upon them by the British
Government for the restoration of the persons taken from on board the
Trent by the Captain of the San Jacinto to the protection of the flag
beneath which they were illegally seized. A calm review of the facts
of the case, an attentive and dispassionate perusal of the diplomatic
correspondence, and a fresh survey of the fearful calamity from which
this decision has rescued both countries, have increased rather than
lessened our thankfulness for this peaceful issue of the difference
which three weeks ago looked so theatening. Both the countries
concerned have reason to rejoice, for, in the event of war, no matter
which of the two may have been the victor, it could have become so
only by passing over the mangled remains of its own most cherished
policy.</p> 
<p>Besides the usual and inevitable evils inseparable from a hostile
collision between two great Powers-the waste of blood and treasure,
the interruption of trade, and the demoralisation of the people on
both sides-war with the Federal State of America would have forced
upon Great Britain an immediate, and perhaps a permanent, sacrifice of
one of her foremost national purposes-namely, the extinction of the
slave trade and the discouragement of slavery all the world
over. Whatever may have been the grounds upon which the States of the
North have come into conflict with those of the South-whatever may be
the professed object for which they are carrying it on, at such
immense cost to themselves, and hitherto with so little apparent
success-at whatever time and in whatever way it may be ultimately
decided-one thing is certain, that as slavery was the remote cause of
the quarrel between North and South, so, but for foreign intervention,
slavery will be weakened, and in the end destroyed, by the prosecution
of the struggle. Quite apart from the will of either of the
belligerents, this seems to be one of the unavoidable consequences of
the present civil war-the only one, we may add, which the people of
England have contemplated with anything approaching to a feeling of
satisfaction. A war with the Federal<pb n="58"/> States would
instantly have coerced us into unwelcome but not the less mischievous
complicity with the bitterest opponents of that policy with which,
more than any other nation upon the face of the earth, we have
identified the name and fame of England, for which we have made the
largest sacrifices and braved the ill-will of other maritime Powers,
and the final success of which seemed even to the most moderate
expectation to be very close at hand. England, allied with a
confederation of slaveholding States, the corner-stone of whose
constitution is not merely the lawfulness but the expediency of
slavery, and the thinly-veiled object of whose policy is the wide
extension of slave territory and the speedy revival of the slave
trade-England, recognising such a confederation, and thereby imparting
to it a vitality and strength which it neither possesses nor deserves,
and assisting it to make good its position against the Free States of
the North, from which, for the sake of perpetuating and extending
slavery, it wantonly seceded;-such a position as this would have been
for our country a cruel necessity, entailing upon it a humiliation,
and exhibiting to the world a scandal, for which no military nor naval
success could have been accepted as adequate compensation. Thank God,
we have escaped the danger.</p> 
<p>And yet, with this miserable contingency before their eyes, we do
not see how the British Government could safely or honourably have
declined to front it, nor how they could have met the embarrassment in
which it placed them more wisely or with more dignity than they have
done. As soon as the facts relating to the capture of Messrs. Mason
and Slidell on board the Trent steamer had been laid before them, they
were calmly referred to the law officers of the Crown for judicial
investigation as to the bearing in which they stood to the law of
nations; and, on the report of those responsible officers that the
Captain of the San Jacinto had taken upon himself to execute judgment
on his individual, and of course unrecognised, authority, without
appealing to the decision of a Prize Court, and had thereby offered an
affront to our flag, Earl Russell irnmediately forwarded to Lord
Lyons, our Minister at Washington, a despatch, couched in the most
courteous terms, assuming that the act of aggression could not have
been committed with the authority or approbation of the Federal
Government, and intimating that the only reparation which this country
could accept would be a restoration of the captured gentlemen to the
protection of the British flag. Confident as her Majesty's Ministers
may have been in the expectation that Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward would
see not only the justice but the policy of admitting this claim, it
behoved them in common prudence to make instant and effectual
preparation for the disagreeable alternative. Winter was setting
in. Canada, in the event of war, would lie exposed to the first
hostile blow from the Federal States. She was wholly unprepared. The
quarrel was not hers. England was bound to place her, if possible, in
a position of security before the rigour of the climate should
preclude all access to her along her own coasts. Hence the despatch to
Washington was immediately followed by the dispatch of troops to
Quebec and Halifax. All available means were taken to strengthen the
fleet. In short, while earnestly desiring peace, and shaping their
course so as to facilitate to the utmost its preservation, the British
Government exhibited the greatest promptitude, activity, and
forethought in making ready for war. In both respects, we believe,
they secured the approbation of the country.</p> 
<p>Mr. Seward's despatch to Lord Lyons has happily averted the dreaded
rupture of amicable relations between the two peoples. He has
justified our claim-he has surrendered the prisoners. Let us accept
with generosity what has been conceded with a show of
cheerfulness. His able despatch might, under other circumstances,
provoke criticism. Its conclusion should disarm any such desire. A
mutual analysis of national motives would do neither nation the least
good, and would probably exhibit neither to unmixed advantage. On both
sides irritating questions might be asked which it would be difficult
to answer in any way that would not exasperate. We have asked the
Federal Union to do us right, and they have done it, openly admitting
that what we asked was justifiable and reasonable. Between individual
gentlemen such a course is held to bury the offence out of sight, and
the propriety of the rule is equally recognised by nations. We should
be sorry, therefore, to demean ourselves by raking among the ashes of
the past for matter of offensive comment, or food for
self-complacency. There is in any such attempt a revolting malignancy
and pettiness of spirit which true and magnanimous Englishmen will
scorn to countenance. Reparation having been made, bygones become
bygones. The wretch who shakes hands over his antagonist's apology and
concession, and thereupon begins to reopen his complaint, displays
himself as a pitiable example of impotency in the government of his
own passions. If the <hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi> fails to
satisfy him, he is justly believed to be nursing a wicked design
beneath a pretended regard for the unsullied purity of his name. Great
Britain, we are certain, will not be guilty of that unspeakable
meanness. What has been frankly yielded, even though more tardily than
she could have wished, will be as frankly received. Why it was not
offered before she will forbear to inquire; and no one better then she
knows, and none more fully than she can appreciate, the difficulty of
at once closing the ears and the heart against the whispered
insinuations of national pride. The last American war was occasioned
by our failing to determine in time what we resolved, when too late,
to surrender. We have reason to be thankful that Mr. Lincoln did not
delay his decision beyond the limit allowed him for deliberation.</p>
<p>We may extract if we will from the anxious experience through which
we have just passed two or three lessons that may be of service to the
world generally as well as to ourselves in particular. We have already
recorded our emphatic approbation of the steps taken by her Majesty's
Ministers to obtain redress for the injury inflicted upon us by
Captain Wilks. We sincerely wish that, inasmuch as it was well known
that they had sent out to the Government at Washington a courteous but
firm demand for reparation, and inasmuch as it could not be known that
such demand would be rejected, there had been less of angry excitement
during the interval. That portion of the public press which for the
last month has been labouring with great power, and, we are compelled
to confess, with too much success, to inflame the warlike passions of
the British people by parading before them as a premeditated and
defiant insult what turns out to have been the rash and foolhardy act
of a naval captain, committed on his own responsibility, has done
itself and the people of this country but little credit. Had it been
necessary to stimulate our own rulers to the performance of what was
due to the honour of this nation, some extenuation, if not excuse,
might have been pleaded for pursuing this course. But no such
necessity existed, or was believed to exist. Neither could the
extravagant and fierce denunciation of the American people and their
institutions contribute in the smallest degree to the pacific decision
of the Federal Government; for the greater part of it will have been
read across the Atlantic only after the offence has been disclaimed
and the reparation made. Unhappily, we have allowed ourselves to be
goaded into an unseemly display of passionate indignation, without any
obvious necessity and before the fitting occasion for it had arisen,
to the manifest danger of increasing the in-will of America and the
exposure of ourselves to ridicule in the eyes of foreign nations. The
inconvenience which will, no doubt, accrue to us from this want of
self-restraint may well teach us that, when a people have taken the
proper steps to vindicate their national honour, it becomes them to
await the issue with self-possession and calm forbearance.</p>
<p>The events of the past month will, we trust, impress upon the minds
of our countrymen another lesson. The occasion has been one on which
the Emperor of the French, if actuated by the secret hostility to this
country which not a few have persistently laid to his charge, might,
without going out of his way, have turned to a selfish account by
leaving it to take its course. A war between England and America would
have made him master of the situation in Europe. Once more, as in the
presence of the Indian mutiny, he has rebuked our distrust by the
loyalty of his behaviour. He chose to throw the whole weight of his
immense influence with the Cabinet at Washington into the scale of
peace by urging a frank concession of our demand. We trust the fact so
honourable to his Government will be borne in mind when next an
attempt is made to sow between him and ourselves the seeds of a
groundless suspicion.</p>
<p>Lastly, let us, in parting from this subject, express our earnest
hope, as we have taken occasion to do more than once already, that the
difficulty from which we have just escaped will lead to a liberal
revision of maritime law. It is susceptible of vast amendments in
favour of neutral commerce, and, we believe, the policy of Great
Britain has hitherto been the chief obstacle to their being
effected. If the painful excitement through which we have passed
should conduce to the framing and establishment of a clear and
reasonable maritime code, the benefit will have been cheaply purchased
by the outlay to which we have been subjected by the affair of the
Trent. In that case the event will have furnished the happiest modern
solution of Samson's riddle, "Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness."</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Edinburgh and Nova Scotian we have news from
New York to the 4th inst. The chief points of interest are the
departure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their secretaries, and the
suspension of cash payments by the United-States' Treasury and the
banks.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEPARTURE OF MESSRS. MAS0N AND SLIDELL.</p>
<p>The Boston <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi> of the 30th ult. says:-
There was no communication with Port Warren on the 28th, in
consequence of the gale, and the prisoners taken from the Trent were
ignorant of the decision of the National Government in favour of their
release. Next day newspapers were carried down, containing the
official correspondence, and Mr. Mason was noticed at the window of
his room perusing the intelligence with a smile of satisfaction upon
his countenance.</p>
<p> On the 1st inst., at eleven o'clock, the four prisoners left Fort
Warren, in Boston Harbour, very quietly, and went on board the steam
tug-boat Starlight, and were conveyed to Provincetown, on the northern
extremity of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where they were received by the
British steam gun-boat Rinaldo, which was to convey them to Halifax,
Nova Scotia, whence they would be conveyed to England by the Cunard
steamer.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EUGENIA SMITH CASE.</p>
<p>Orders have been given by the Government for the release of
Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, taken from the British schooner Eugenia
Smith by the United States' steamer Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE CABINET.</p>
<p>A usually well-informed correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New
York Tribune</hi> gives the following account of what passed within
the White House in reference to the Trent affair:-</p>
<p>At the first Cabinet meeting held after the seizure of
Messrs. Slidell and Mason, the President expressed himself in favour
of restoring them to the protection of the British flag if it should
be demanded. He said it was doubful if the course of Captain Wilks
could be justified by international law; and that, at all events, he
could not afford to have two wars on his hands at the same
time. Attorney-General Bates echoed this opinion. He thought the
seizure unjustifiable, and was in favour of giving up the men upon
demand. Secretary Seward was non-committal. The other members of the
Cabinet disagreed with Mr. Lincoln positively; and Secretary Chase
argued forcibly and with warmth that the course recommended by the
President would be dishonourable to the United States as a
nation. Thus matters stood until the first belligerent note from
England. No further discussions took place, nor was the question again
mooted in the Cabinet until Christmas Day. The despatch from Earl
Russell to Lord Lyons was delivered at the State department on
Saturday, as we telegraphed the next day, and Mr. Seward immediately
went to work on his reply. Remembering the views of the Cabinet
previously expressed, Mr. Lincoln was not in haste to call them
together. One meeting was adjourned to prevent premature discussion,
and another on the regular day did not take place. The first was on
Christmas Day, and after Lord Lyons had made his
communication. Immediately M. Thouvenel's despatch had been delivered,
Mr. Seward's reply was read to the Council, in a session prolonged for
five hours. The despatch of M. Thouvenel had convinced the opponents
of the policy of surrender that the public opinion of Europe would
sustain England, and it was used to secure unanimity in that
policy. Mr. Seward's despatch, however, was subjected to much
criticism. Many alterations and modifications were suggested. The next
day a revised copy was read to the adjourned Cabinet meeting; further
changes were suggested; and the despatch, as a whole, was not approved
and adopted until Friday morning.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TONE OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>The tone of the American press, taken as a whole, is much less
hostile to England since the settlement of the Trent difficulty than
it had been for many months previous. The Philadelphia papers are more
bitter than those of New York and Boston. There is, however, an uneasy
impression abroad that the British Government is only seeking an
opportunity for breaking the blockade of the Southern ports for the
sake of dismembering the Union and procuring a supply of cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SUSPENSION OF CASH PAYMENTS.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the 28th ult., the New York bankers held a
meeting and agreed to suspend cash payments from the 30th ult. This
example was followed by the banks throughout the country. The specie
in the vaults of the New York banks had fallen from 50,000 000 to
24,000,000 dols. Exchange on England had risen to 113, gold was
already at a premium of l&fract12; to 2 per cent. The banks had
informed the Government that they could give it no more aid. They
refused to take the fourth loan of 50,000,000 dols, asked by the
Federal Government. The scheme of Mr. Chase for superseding the
ordinary bank currency by an issue of Government notes had been
dropped. The commercial classes were pressing on Congress the
necessity of providing a revenue to the amount of at least 150,000,000
dols. The popular subscriptions to the national loan are now merely
nominal in New York, not amounting to 100,000 dols. a week.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>The Senate has agreed to Mr. Sumner's resolution, asking the
President to transmit to the Senate all the correspondence which has
taken place since the Paris Congress in relation to neutral and
belligerent rights upon the ocean.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevens had introduced into the House of Representatives a bill
for abolishing Southern ports of entry.</p>
<p>The Navy Department had sent out specifications inviting proposals
from shipbuilders throughout the country for the construction of
ironclad steam-batteries. The commission appointed to examine the
Stevens floating-battery had reported against it.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had been confined to his bed for ten days by a
depressing attack of low typhoid fever. At last accounts his health
had somewhat improved.</p>
<p>The Comte de Paris and the Duc de Chartres, acting, it is said, on
the advice of their mother, had resigned their commissions in the
Federal service.</p>
<p>New-Year's Day was marked by especial cordiality on the part of the
diplomatic corps. All the Foreign Ministers, with their Legations,
were present at the official reception at the White House, and all
subsequently called on the Secretary of State. The presence of the
entire British and French Legations at both places was especially
noticed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>There have been destructive fires both in Nashville, Charleston,
and Richmond. In the former city the commissary stores, including a
portion of the Ordnance Department, and valued at one million dollars,
were destroyed. In Richmond the theatre had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The Confederates in Kentucky had destroyed a large portion of the
railway between Louisville and Nashville.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> states that a large
Federal force from Beaufort had landed at North Edisto, on the South
Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The return of the chief emigration agent of the Canadian Government
for the year 1861 shows that the troubles in the neighbouring country
have partially turned the tide of European emigration towards
Canada. The gross total of persons landed in 1861 was 19,923, against
only 10,150 in 1860. This gives an increase of nearly 100 per cent;
and the agent "has every reason to believe" that the year just entered
upon will show, if Canada is spared the calamity of war, as large an
increase of immigration in 1862 over that of 1861 as that of 1861 was
in excess of the previous year. The nationalities of the immigrants
were:-Norwegians, 8814; English, 3579; Irish, 3160; Scotch, 2011;
Germans, 2182; Russian Poles, 27; French, 10; United States' Citizens,
12; Canadians and others, 371. The destination of about half was the
United States.</p></div2>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Tuesday's <hi
rend="smallcaps">Gazette</hi> are published some documents making an
important addition to the large mass of official correspondence which
has already been published with reference to the Mason-Slidell
case. These documents more immediately concern the course of our own
Foreign Office in the matter.</p>
<p>On the 19th of December Earl Russell wrote to Lord Lyons, giving
the details of an interview which took place on that day between his
Lordship and Mr. Adams, the American Minister. On that occasion
Mr. Adams communicated to our Foreign Secretary the substance of
Mr. Seward's despatch, declaring that Captain Wilks, in seizing the
two Southern Commissioners and their secretaries, had acted without
the authority of the Washington Government, which stood "quite
uncommitted" on the question at issue. The noble Earl's comment upon
this explanation was, that he "thought it would stand in place of an
apology." On the point which still remained to he settled, Lord Lyons
was instructed as follows- "If he (Mr. Seward) asks what will be the
consequence of his refusing compliance, I think you should say that
you wish to leave him and the President quite free to take their own
course, and that you desire to abstain from anything like menace."
Mr. Adams asked Lord Russell point-blank, "whether, if Lord Lyons came
away a declaration of war would be the immediate consequence?" -a
question to which the noble Earl replied that "nothing was decided on
that point; we should wait for a reply from America, and then decide
upon our course."</p>
<p>In a despatch dated Jan. 11, Lord Russell has the satisfaction of
announcing to our Minister at Washington-who is thanked for the
"discretion and good temper" he has manifested in this important
matter-that the liberation of the prisoners and the explanations
offered by Mr. Seward "constituted the reparation which her Majesty
and the British nation had a right to expect." His Excellency was,
however, informed that her Majesty's Government could not assent to
the conclusions arrived at by the Federal Secretary of State on some
points of international law, and that the discussion of these
questions, would form the subject of a special despatch. "In the
meantime," adds Lord Russell, "it will be desirable that the
commanders of the United States' crusers should be instructed not to
repeat acts for which the British Government will have to ask for
redress and which the United States' Government cannot undertake to
justify."</p></div2>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Federal camp,
visiting the advanced posts on the 12th ult., came upon General
Blenker's pickets at Auandale, about ten miles from Washington. Whilst
he was in the neighbourhood a dash was made at them by a squadron of
Confederate cavalry- fine, rough-looking fellows, dressed in
nondescript uniforms, red shirts, grey tunics; some with boots and
some without; armed with sabres and revolvers. Many of them were very
powerfully built, and as they rushed in among the men of the 45th New
York they clutched at them and dragged thirteen off at a gallop. Three
or four were killed on each side. An Engraving of this dashing attack,
from a sketch by our Special Artist, is given at page 61.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HIS</hi> magnificent work was erected for the
purpose of connecting the New York Central and the Great Western of
Canada Railways, and the cost was contributed by both companies in
equal portions. It is by means of this bridge only that an unbroken
journey can be made from New York, or Boston, to the western part of
Canada, without changing carriages; the consequence of which is, that
the best and cheapest route to the west, not only of Canada, but also
of the United States, is still by the New York Central and the Great
Western of Canada Railways, although many other western routes have
sprung into existence since this was completed. Chicago and the
western prairie country generally are reached by this route more
easily than by any other, as is also Detroit and all parts of
Michigan.</p> 
<p>The great bridge the subject of our present notice was not the
first of the kind which spanned the gorge of the Niagara River, an
ingenious suspension-bridge having been constructed across it many
years ago by Mr. C. Ellett, but of very fragile and temporary
character when compared with the present work.</p>
<p>The Niagara Railway Suspension-bridge was erected from the designs,
and under the personal superintendence, of Mr. John A. Roebling, at a
cost of 400,000 dols. The first engine crossed over it on the 8th of
March, 1855. It carries a double line of rails on the upper part, and
an ample roadway for carriages below.</p>
<p>The plan adopted in the construction of this suspension-bridge
differs materially from those usually built in England. Instead of
flat wrought-iron plate-links, connected together by pins passing
through their extremities, Mr. Roebling uses a simple wire-cable, or
rather four wire cables, each lOin. in diameter, and composed of 3640
separate wires, the whole of the cables being capable of bearing a
weight of 12,000 tons; the actual load they carry never exceeds 1000
tons. The wire ropes are securely anchored in the solid rook,
30ft. below the surface; they pass over the summits of four solid
stone towers, 8Oft. in height. Beside the wire cables there are 624
suspending-rods, whose ultimate strength is equal to 18,720 tons;
these support the roadway at different parts, and are connected with
the cables above. There are also sixty-four over-floor stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1920 tons, and fifty-six river-stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1680 tons; these latter stays extend from the
bridge to the rocks on either side of the ravine. The total length of
span between the towers is 8OOft., and the "railway track," as it is
always called in America, is 250ft, above the surface of the water in
the river.</p>
<p>The great object sought to be obtained in this remarkable bridge
after strength to carry its load, was rigidity; for in all
suspension-bridges, as ordinarily constructed, the deflection and
oscillation would be such as to entirely prevent their being used for
the purposes of carrying railway traffic. The Niagara Suspension
Railway-bridge, although not perfectly rigid, is sufficiently so to
allow of heavily-laden trains passing over it at a maximum speed of
five miles per hour; even then a very considerable deflection takes
place, but not such as to in any way betray weakness; on the contrary,
it is rather an indication<pb n="68"/> of strength, as showing the
correct action of all its parts, by which means a true bearing is
obtained over every part of it.</p>
<p>A wonderful amount of ingenuity and mechanical skill is displayed
in the construction of the roadway, which forms a species of lattice
or tubular girder, the railway track being on the top outside, and the
carriage roadway on the bottom inside. The frequent admixture of wood
and iron, and the numberless small bolts and screws passing through
the former material, will require constant care and supervision to
prevent decay occurring, and may probably cause the cost of
maintenance of the bridge to be excessive. Portions are now being
constantly renewed, and always with an increased strengthening of the
parts. The bridge, however, taken as a whole, must be looked upon as a
decided success and a triumph of American engineering skill; while the
advantages of a perfect communication between the United States and
the most valuable portions of the British possessions in North America
cannot be overrated. The general effect of the Niagara
Suspension-bridge is that of extreme lightness and beauty; the
situation in which it is placed is exceedingly fine, being in view of
the Great Falls, while below it the Niagara River rushes through its
confined channel, a foaming, noisy rapid 15Oft. deep, almost as
terrible in its roar and force as the mighty cataract itself.</p>
<p>A bridge similar to the Niagara Suspension-bridge, and of even
greater span, but only carrying an ordinary roadway, ha[sic] been
built over the River St. John, in the city of St. John, in New
Brunswick. This bridge, some time after it was erected, gave way
during a terrific gale of wind. The suspension cables remained sound
and fully equal to their duty; but the roadway had been insecurely
connected with the abutments, and it broke adrift at that point. The
whole length of roadway oscillated many feet clear of the abutment
altogether, yet only a portion of it gave way, the bridge proving
itself in all other respects equal to withstanding strains that it
never was expected to be subjected to.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna we have news from New York to the
evening of the 11th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">WAR NEWS.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had not yet fully recovered from his attack of
typhoid fever, but had taken several airings in a carriage.</p>
<p>General Bnrnside's expedition had left Annapolis and would
rendezvous at Hampton Roads. The precise destination of this
expedition has been kept a profound secret. The Boston <hi
rend="italic">Traveller</hi> announces that several divisions of the
army of the Potomac will reinforce this expedition.</p>
<p>A fight is reported to have taken place at Huntersville, in Western
Virginia, in which the Confederates retired with loss in killed,
wounded, clothing, and stores.</p>
<p>A portion of the Mississippi expedition had already started on its
mission, which is supposed to be an attack on Nashville.</p>
<p>The steamer Vanderbilt had arrived in New York from Port Royal with
about 700 full bales of Sea Island cotton.</p><pb n="81"/>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S COURTESY.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has tendered to Lord Lyons permission to the British
troops en route to Canada to land at Portland, and proceed by railroad
through Maine to their destination.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The Richmond papers declare that their army is suffering severely
from the cold and that it is to a great extent demoralised. They think
that Great Britain will not be satisfied with Mr. Seward's despatch
upon the Trent question, and will make further demands. The Richmond
<hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> thinks that the sinking the stone fleet
will do no harm to the city of Charleston, but will render it
impregnable to a sea attack. Since the sinking of that fleet the
steamer Ella Warley, from Nassau, ran into Charleston with a cargo of
arms, medicines, and other stores. Several vessels have left the
harbour and run to sea by other channels, one of which has recently
arrived in Liverpool. The Captain saw nothing of the blockading
fleet.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>
<p>In a debate in the House of Representatives on the Trent question
Mr. Vallandigham expressed himself dissatisfied with the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said that America would be at war with
England in less than three months unless the Federal Government tamely
submit to the recognition of the South and the raising of the
blockade. Mr. Hutchins, of Ohio, considered that Mr. Vallandigham
wanted war with England for the benefit of the South. Mr. Thomas, of
Massachusetts, was of opinion that England had done that which had
implanted in the American breast a sense of wrong which would wait the
opportunity to strike a blow of retributive justice.</p>
<p>Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate's Committee of Foreign
Affairs, has spoken in the Senate, and taken positions similar to
those of M. Thouvenel and in advance of those taken by Mr. Seward. He
said:-</p>
<p>If Captain Wilks suspected the Trent he should have taken her into
port for decision. No Federal court, however, recognising American
precedents, could have lawfully condemned the Trent or detained the
Commissioner. The American Government has committed itself fully and
unreservedly to the right of a neutral flag to cover civil
passengers. The question has been argued with the greatest ability and
thoroughness by the most eminent American statesmen, including
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and other Presidents, and the whole record
of American diplomacy is luminous with arguments against such acts as
that of Captain Wilks. Captain Wilks, misled by a British law book,
violated American principles. England, by demanding the Commissioners,
stultified her history and virtually acknowledged the justice of a
position long maintained by America. The American people (concluded
Mr. Sumner) are indebted to Captain Wilke's act and Mr. Seward's
statesmanship for a great political triumph.</p>
<p>The Naval Committee has reported on a bill for the construction of
twenty iron-plated steam gun-boats.</p>
<p>The Committee of Ways and Means have reported a bill authorising
the issue of 100,000,000 dols. worth of demand notes, which will
constitute a legal tender, be receivable for Government dues, and
exchangeable at any time for Six per Cent Bonds, redeemable in twenty
years.</p>

<p rend="center">TRADE AND FINANCE.</p>
<p>Exchange on London has risen to 114; gold to 4 per cent premium,
and silver to 1&fract12; per cent premium. The imports of foreign dry
goods into the port of New York for the year 1861 amount to 43,600,000
dols., against 101,800,000 in 1860, being a fall in one year of 63 per
cent. In the year after the celebrated financial crisis (1858) the
imports amounted to 61,000,000 dols. The arrivals in New York of
passengers from foreign ports were 80,790 in 1861, against 266,627 in
1860; of passengers from California, 9117 against 10,710 in 1860.</p>

<p rend="center">ADDRESS OF CONDOLENCE WITH THE QUEEN.</p>
<p>At a crowded meeting of British residents held at the English
Cosulate in New York an address of sympathy and condolence with the
Queen was adopted.</p>

<p rend="center">NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP IN MISSOURI.</p>
<p>The Provost Marshal of St. Louis has notified to all newspapers
appearing outside that city that a copy of each issue must be sent him
for inspection, under penalty of suppression.</p>

<p rend="center">THE GOVERNORS' MESSAGES.</p>
<p>The opening of the year is the season when most of the State
Governors present their annual messages to their respective
Legislatures. The Governor of the Border State of Maine complains of
the deep and bitter hostility of large numbers of the people of New
Brunswick and Canada. He thinks that Portland should be made the
Quebec and Halifax of the United States, and that with only present
means of defence Portland would in the event of a war with Great
Britain soon be in possession of the enemy. It is requisite for these
purposes not only to construct military works on the coast, but
military railroads for their connexion with one another. If the United
States do not at once set about these works, Maine must do so on her
own account. He complains that the attitude of England has been marked
by many exhibitions of the most positive unkindness and ill-will,
while her friendship for the rebels has been manifested by an unbroken
succession of favours, valuable in themselves, but more valuable for
the hopes encouraged by the ostentatious manner in which they were
conferred. "We have all thought till recently that war with England
was scarcely within the category of possible events. That she should
make a war which she must know this country would feel and history
would record was waged by her in the history of barbarism and wrong,
and designed to inflict an irreparable and unprovoked injury upon a
nation which had been, in honest faith, her best friend and, as far as
the wishes of its people were concerned, her truest ally, was what the
American people could not believe."</p>
<p>The Governor of Michigan, another Border State, speaks "of the
manifest disposition of foreign Powers to intermeddle with our
domestic affairs," and recommends the Federal Government to establish
at some convenient point in the north-west an arsenal and manufactory
of arms, and also a naval station, to be located in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Mayor of New York, in his Message, urges that rafts or other
barriers should be anchored at the Narrows, in readiness to obstruct
the channel, if necessary.</p>

<p rend="center">DESPATCHES FROM LORD LYONS TO EARL RUSSELL.</p>
<p>In Friday's <hi rend="smallcaps">Gazette</hi> were published copies
of some despatches from Lord Lyons. The first informs Earl Russell that Messrs. Zacharie and Rogers, taken from on board the Eugenia Smith, under the British flag, and confined in Fort Lafayette, had been released, and the act disavowed; a second refers to a case in which a captured British schooner, the James Campbell, was taken into port with the British flag flying under the American-a proceeding which has been rebuked by Mr. Seward, and ordered not to be repeated; and the third relates that certain English seamen, captured for a break of blockade, having been required to take an oath never to be engaged in such a proceeding again, have been declared by Mr. Seward absolved from such oath.</p></div2>

<p>Once more we hear from America that a grand movement by the North
is in hand. Land and water armaments are to penetrate into the heart
of the South, Nashville is to in taken, and then a great blow is to be
struck at New Orlea'is. We can only say, as heretofore, that we shall
see. The Mississippi will now be the centre of interest for the
spectators of the strife. The sinews of war are to be provided by a
fax of 150 millions of dollars, at least such is the resolution of the
Congressional Committee of Ways and Means. There had been some violent
anti-English language in both Houses, but it seems to have expressed
the feelings of a miserable minority, the people generally being bent
upon the prosecution of the war with the South. It was said that the
Vindictive effort to destroy Charleston harbour was not likely to be
very mischievous, some reports declaring that the sinking of the
vessels would actually facilitate the improvement of the port, while
Southern organs thank the North for having made the city
impregnable. The American question has not received much public
discussion here during the week, save that Mr. Massey, the Chairman of
Committees and in some sort a Government authority, has delivered a
speech in 'which he manifested a desire that the blockade should be
broken. The journals of the Southern States believe that, bond
Pabnerston's Government are friendly to the North, and that the people
of England are inclined towards the South; and therefore the slave
journalists venture to predict a speedy fall for our present
Administration. We cite this in evidence of the titter ignorance of
the Americans of English affairs.</p>

<p>As regards foreign affairs there is not much to record, except that
the Spanish expedition to Mexico is left to do the principal part of
the work of amelioration; and the commander seems inclined to perform
his duties in an effective way, and one which would probably invite
unfriendly interference by the United States if they were united and
had not their hands full. But circumstances forbid the enforcement of
the insolent and nonsensical doctrine that the Powers of the East have
no right to interfere in the affairs of the Western World, a bit of
geographical pedantry which will certainly not be tolerated in
Europe. The interests of the New World are too important to -the Old
to permit their being left in the hands of any single nation.</p>

IeEE. yANCEY, COMMISSIONER OF THE C0}tPEDERATB STATES.

Pnm Hon. Wm. Lowndes Yancey is a native of the State of South Carolina, where he was

born in 1815. Form!all years plist, he has resided in the great Cottoate of Alabama. Mr. ranrey is a cotton-planter, end until the date of secession of Alabama was a member of the

Bar of that State.

Though exercising a strong influence upon

the politics of the South during the last twenty years Mr. Yancey has but rarely been a candidate for political honours. He has, however, served as a member of the House of Hepresentatives and of the senate of Alabama, and has also been a member of the Federal Congress at Washington. While in Congress he took a prominent part in the annexation of Texas and in the sesilement of the difficulties between England and the United States with reference to the disputed territory of Oregon. He was the first in Congress to denounce the party in that body who desired to repeal the convention for the joint occupancy of Oregon, entered into in isis contending that such a repeal under the circumstances would lead to a war with C-rent Britain, which he strongly disapproved of. fle also voted for the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific Ocean, his object being to withdraw, the slavery question from Congress, if possible, and thus to lessen the ca-uses of irritation between the North and South. The Northern vote, however, defeated the measure.

:Mr. Yancey's chief claim to public notice rests

in hisearly recognition of the ineradicable differences existing between the North end South, and which time, instead of diminishing, ex-

 tended and strengthened. In his opinion these differences were fast sectionalism g the people of the North and the South, and he predicted

that the Union would be dissolved whenever they stood arrayed as sections, the one against the other.

In a public letter, written several years since,

which excited great attention at the time he gave it as his opinion that the South would no ionger submit tofurther compromise of what she considered to be her constitutional rights, that

Vth aities nor corgiromises could save the 'M.f 9t it. dissol. 0. was but question C>f ii-2-le, and that it would first takae place in the Cotton States, end thence would spread into the Border States-s. prediction that has been signally verified within the last few months.

The events in progress in the Northern States,

showing that the North would present a candidate for the Presidency upon an avowed sectional basis in 1860, induced Mr. Yancey in 1859 tourge upon the Legislature of Alabama the passing of an Act making it the duty of the Governor to call a convention of the people of that State to consider so serious an event. 'When, in 1860 Mr. Lincoln was elected as an exponent 1 Northern, and an enemy of Southern, interests, the convention of Alabama wa-S immediately called, followed by those of all the other Cotton. States, the whole of 'which deliberately withdrew from the Union, and, on the 11th of March, 1861, formed the G-overnment of the Confederate States of

America. Mr. Yancey was at this time s leading member of the convention of Alabama, and reported the ordinance of secession.

In selecting three gentlemen to form a com mission to the Powers of Europe to present the claims of the Confederate States to recognition and friendly commercial relations, President Davis considered it an occasion to recognise the long persistent services of Mr. Yancey in the cause of the South; end, as he had been the first to urge and obtain the consent of the South to secede and form an independent Ccnfederacy, it was felt that he should be the first in a commission to obtain recognition of the new Power from the elder nations of the earth, and especially from Great Britain and France. Hence Mr. Yancey was appointed to be the senior or chief of the commission toEurope, and has been in this country and in France in that capacity since May last

 In November last Alabama elected Mr.

Yancey to represent her in the Senate of the Confederate States, which will be organised on the 17th of February next, the day when the

ermanent supersedes the present provisional overnment of the South.

ILLVSTRATLONS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA. A NIGHT flAltM IN TEE FEDERAL CAMP.

FaSQUENTLY there are alarms in the Federal

camp on the Potomac at night caused by the

driving in of the pickets and the appearance in force of the Confederates at different points of the Union lines. On these occasions it is necessary to communicate with the Commander-inChief, and to do this expeditiously anew system of signals has been introduced into the Federal army. By day messages are sent from one division to another by the use of differentlycoloured flags, thus doing away with the necessityof:dispatngmonntedfrooperawithttten ordera; and by night lamp-torches take their place with the same effect These signals can be used with an army in motion, the corps attached to the different brigades occupying as they move all elevations or lofty bulldmgs on their route. The accompanying Illustration represents the signals at work by night. At the signalman's feet lies a large brass lamp, which is the axis around which the motive ligt forms its curves-each curve, according to the direction which it takes, signifying a number, the meaning of which number being known cnly to the officer commanding each corps.

ADY4ROS OF THE SEIRHISflES OF THE BUOHTAXL BIFLES ON DBAUISVUaLE.

The heroes of the fight at Drainsvllle,

Virginia, on the 20th ult., were the Bncktsil Riflemen, a corps of sharpshooters raised in the mountains of Pennsylvania. To be eligible for service in this corps each man must have shot a buck, and hence the badge the members wear on their cape, and the name they bear. The forces engaged in this fight-almost the onlysuccesswbxchtheFederalshaaumedmthe field in that neighbourhood-="C brigades of General Stuart on the Confederate side, and of General Ord, Unionist, to the latter of which
the Buoktaila belong. The incident illustrated on the first page is

where the riflemen are advancing their skhmihers through the undergrowth towards the Confederate gum, while other Federal regiments are making a flanking movement by a detour on each side to clear the pine woods. The Bucktai]e were consequently exposed to the severest fire during the action, and sufered the most. But the number of dead left by the Confederates in the field in front of their position-nearly all of whom were shot through the head-show that they also paid dearly for the losses suered by the rifles.

OUR RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.

Is it our unhappy destiny to become involved in a third war with the people of the United States, with whom we have so many ties of language, race, religion, and laws? This is an apprehension which weighs heavily on the public mind at the present moment, and which Mr. Seward's highflying diplomacy, concurring with the incensed temper towards England of the Northern people, will not allow us to slide. "The relations between the two countries," said Mr. Gladstone, at Leith, "afford a thousand points of contact every day, and must necessarily likewise afford opportunities for collision." Re would be a bold man who would be willing to give assurance that those opportunities will always be met in a spirit of mutual forbearance and concession. The &itich Americana, whose situation compels them to a close acquaintance with the character and tendencies of their neighbours, forewarn no with ominous unanimity that the evil day is only postponed, not conjured away for ever. How the events of the last twelvemonth have necessarily resulted in. biinging an American war, which seemed so distant, in 1860, into the foreground of our national prospects merits a brief explanation.

The eleven "Confederate" States, in seceding, shattered with the same blow the Union and Constitution of 1787 and the basis on which peace between Britain and the Union had hitherto rested. Without forgetting the influence in behalf of international amity wielded by a small section of New England politicians, of whom the late Daniel Webster and Charles Sumner are the best-known representatives, we must, nevertheless, mainly attribute the maintenance of peace for the last thirty years to the nnwjliingness of Southern politicians to initiate a war which, if successful, could only result in strengthening the Northern States by adding to them a territory which would immediately give at least four anti-slavery States to the Union and overbalance Slave-soil acquisitions at the South by immense Free-soil acquisitions at the North. It is patent to every one that those who struggled so fiercely and fraudulently to wrest the single State of Kansas from a Northern immigration would be in no hurry (however great t,heirdialike of British influence) to make sacrifices to annex British America to the Union. They therefore judged it politic to bridle the bellicose propensities of the people of the Middle and Western States and to put them off with a succession of vexatious international disputes never meant to be urged to the issue of war. From this situation resulted peace, butapeace little to be envied, because it was a pace without amity, and sometimes even without common courtesy. On several occasions of late years it cannot be denied that the English nation have felt that this was a situation which benefited their political and commercial interests at the expense of their honour.

 This guarantee of peace is now withdrawn, and we look around in

vain tofind asubstitute. The South can never again beto us what

abe has been. i in the present conflict she is able to maintain her independence, then the Northern people stand alone, absolute masters of their own destiny. If, on the other hand, the South is subjugated by the North, she will use whatever political influence she may hereafter possess in the Union to precipitate a foreign war, in order that she may find therein a splendid opportunity for revolt, and a sweet occasion for revenge. It is bootless to inquire whether the independence or the reconqut of the South would bathe most unfavourable combination for the continuance of pace with the British empire. It is sufficient that neither one coutingeficy nor the other offers any stable basis on which we could reasonably rest our hopes. A new experiment would coinmcnce-that of administering British rule on the American continent alongside of a multitudinous, pugnacious, -ti-British, and henceforth s,wteeked democracy, dwelling south of the St. Lawrence and the lakes. Who rays that this experiment will he allowed to evolve itself without interruption ? Not the British Americana, nor those best acquainted with the ideas and passions of the Americana of the North. This everpresent apprehension of war, and all the expense of preparation that it involves, is what we must henceforward resign ourselves to pay as the price of our continued dominion on the American continent; and it is highly flattering to our national self-love that no voice has been heard in any part of British America praying us to remove our flag, although the knowledge that the proximity of that flag is a chronic source of irritation to the neighbouring democracy iapoaeeased by every

schoolboy in Canada. - - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

embarrassed nation would not be willing to refer to the arbitration of athird party. Itwould. beonrduty and interest to give as wide an extension to the principle of arbitration as possible; but, in the event of cases arising which in the opinion of our statesmen could not with propriety be referred to an umpire, then we could well afford to be magnanimous, and wait to vindicate our honour until the United States had their hands disengaged. Europe could not misinterpret our motives, and the American Democracy arc no longer under the delusion that Britain "cannot be kicked into a war" with their irresistible selves. But, indeed, the very readiness on our part to take such a generous position would not fail to touch the heart of the American people, and dispose them to make reparation for whatever injury or insult they might have inflicted on us. It would also do much towards creating such a feeling between the two nations as would postpone for a long time, if it did not for ever avert, the outbreak of another war. As the older, sager, and, as we claim, more chivalrous nation, Britain, we believe, would find it conduce not less to her honour than to her interests to take such an attitude.

 If, however, this is to expect too much of human nature as dis

played in the relations between two rival nations, let us at least rise superior to every temptation to take the United States at a disadvantage, remembering that there are cases where it is not Plc vitals but Vs victoribus, and where military triumphs are fruitful only in political, moral, and economical losses to the nation which wins them, If after the present war is settled, by the recunquest or the independence of the States which acknowledge Mr. Davis as their chiefi the Northern Democracy force an unjust quarrel upon us, we shall see, as we eawin 1812, a powerful peace party arise among the Americans themselves whose condemnation of the war will enfeeble its intensity, curtail its resources, shorten its duration, and neutralise the resentments it would engender. Bat such a party will only arise in the event of our meeting the North in fair single combat If in such a war Great Britain were victorious, in the reaction of defeat universal suffrage would be offered up as a victim to the wounded national pride of the American people, and with a limited suffrage on the south of the St. Lawrence we should have reached once more a solid guarantee of peace. If Great Britain were defeated and obliged to abandon some of her possessions on the continent, the victors, in the acquisition of one or more disaffected and anti-American provinces, would soon discover that they had damaged themselves more than their opponent. If (what is highly probable) a.treaty of peace left neither party victorious, the bellicose democracy would have lesrat once more that a war on the Canadian frontier "does not pay," and would be little inclined to re-enact for a fourth time a stale and worn-out tragedy. Such an international single combat, deplorable as it would be, might find us better friends at its termination than at its commencement; and in no case, on whichever aide victory inclined, could it leave behind it that "study of revenge-immortal hate," which would surely be the most fell accompaniment and the most pernicious legacy of a struggle into which we should allow ourselves to enter as the virtual ally of those whom the whole people of the loyal States riahtly or wrongly regard as rebels, parricides, and traitors of the deepest dye.

THE BLOCKING-UP OF CHARLESTON.

PROTEST OF THE BRITISH GOVERMfM.

Shipownors' Association, Liverpool, Jan. 13.

My Lord,-It has acme to the knowledge of the Liverpool Shipownera'

Association, through the public prints, that the Federal Government of the United States have sunk a atone squadron in the mom channel of Charleston harbour- This proceeding cannot fail seriously and permanently to injure the entrance to that harbour. The association fears that, unless strong reproecntatione and romonstrences are promptly made, a similar course may he I immediately followed lathe case of the other harbour, of the Confederate States. The association does not think it necessary to dwell at length on the importance of this question as affecting the general interests of commerce, but feels called upon, as representing an important interest, to address your Lordship on the subject. r am, therefore, Instructed by the association respectfully to press tbls matter on your Lordship's earnest consideration. r have the honour to he, my Lord, your Lordship's meet obedient humble servant, Paaorcrs A. Cnluv, Chairman.

To the Right lion. Earl Russell, Foreign Office, London.
But if a third warwith the United States eanonly tooprobable occurrence, then it may be said, the sooner it comes the better. "Let as accept the first gage of battle thrown down by the Transatlantic Demos and punish them for their rash arrogance by ensuring the dismemberment of the Union." This is the hasty logic of the soldier. The statesman and the moralist will argue quite differently. Conceding that in a merely military point of view the conditions may never be so favourable to our side as during the existence of the present troubles, we unhesitatingly affirm that they can hardly ever be so unfavourable in a political, commercial, and moral point of view. If we should be tempted to pick up the glove thrown down by a passionate people in their hour of difficulty and distress the British nation would never be forgiven by any class or section of the Northern people. If through any direct agency of this nation their idolised Union were dismembered, what would-be the result? Keenly watching every turn of the world's kaleidoscope, the Northerners would subordinate their whole foreign policy to the fanatical prosecution of one idea-that of dismembering the Britiahe mpire and humiliating the British nation. Mr. Seward has already given us a friendly hint of the prospects of our trade with the United States in such an event. Conscious of the resentful cbsracter of his own people, he shudders as he contemplates a contingency,,, which will leave no roots remaining out of which trade between the United States and Great Britain, as it has hitherto flourished, can ever again spring up!' If our manufactures would be excluded how could our English and Scottish immigrants hope to fare? From the Atlantic to the Pacific the United States would be too hotly vindictive towards our race and name to offer an asylum to our emigration. This is a consideration of no small moment to our middle and working classes, from whose ranks the whole of our emigration proceeds.

 We could expect no compensation for this terrible hostility in the ardent attachment of the Confederate States, whose independence we should have established. There is a moral gulf between the British and Slave State people which no accidental, ephemeral, political, and military alliance could bridge over. The Southern Confederacy, if it can make good its independence by its own unaided resources, will probably offer to our commerce better terms than it ever enjoyed under the old Union; while the creation of a balance of power on the American continent would be viewed without regret as well by Great Britain as by the other nations of the Old and New Worlds. But these advantages must he won for us, if at all, by Southern patriotism, and net by English interference.

If these premises he correct, they lead op to this conclusion, that it

is our trnest policy to exercise great forbearance towards the United

&ates during the course of the present war and t&avoid doing anything which seems to evince a desire to take advantage ,of their temporary difficulties. It is not conceivable that any cause of difference can arise between the two nations during this crisis which the

Foreign Office, Jan. 10.

Mr,--I am directed by Earl Russell to acknowledge the receipt of the letter which, on behalf of the Liverpool Shipewners' Association, you addressed to him on the lath inst., calling his attention to the course which the Federal Government of the United States have adapted for closing the main channel of Charleston harbour by sinking there vessels laden with stone, and expressing the fear of the association that, unless strong representations and remonstrauss, are promptly mode, a similar course may be immediately followed in the ooze of the other harbours of the Confederate States. I sm to reqnest that you will state to the Liverpool Shipowners' Association that the attention of her Majesty's Government was at once attracted by the rumours which obtained currency some weeks ago of each a course as that in which you refer being contemplated by the Government of the United States, and on the 20th of December her Majesty's Minister at Washington was informed of she view taken of it by her Majesty's Government. Lord Lyons was told that such a cruel plan would seem to imply despair of the restoration of the Union, the professed object of the war; for it never could be the utah of the United States' Government to destroy cities from which their own country was to derive a portion of its riches and prosperity. Such a plan could only be adopted as a measure of revenge end of irremediable injury against an enemy.

 Lord Lyons was further told that oven as a scheme of embittered and zen

guinsry war such a measure would not be justifiable. It would be a plot against the commerce of all maritime nations and against the tree intercourse of the Southern States of America with the civilised world. Lord Lyons was desired to speak in this sense to Mr. Seward, who, it was hoped, would disavow the illegal project Now, however, that the project seems to have been carried into effect at Charleston, Lord Lyons will be instructed to make a further representation to Mr. Seward, with a view to prevent similar sobs of destruction in other ports. -I am, Sir, your most obedient servant,

F. A. Clint, Nag., too. -  N. Knnxoien.

The subject was discussed at the meeting of the council of the

Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on Monday, when the following

resolution was adopted -" That this chamber views with great satisfaction the remoustrances made by her Majesty's Government with regard to the blocking up of Charleston harbour by sinking vessels laden with stone."
