<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">OME</hi>  of our readers may possibly be puzzled, when reading American news, to find most important intelligence from California, Oregon, British Columbia, and the  Pacific side  of the continent of North America contained in a short paragraph headed "By Pony Express," and the questions naturally arise, What is meant by a pony express?  where does it come from? where does it go? and why is it a pony express, and not a horse, or a stagecoach, or a railway express?  For the purpose of giving some information on this point, our Special Artist has taken the trouble to visit the locale of the pony express, to see it arrive and depart at its eastern terminus, and also to get a view of it enroute on the plains.</p>
<p>The great importance of maintaining rapid communication between the States of the American Union situation of the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards has long been felt, and numerous projects for connecting them by railways have been continually before Congress, but to the present time scarcely anything has been done either towards the railway or telegraph.  Between the Missouri River and California-a distance of 2000 miles-there exists a huge wilderness of prairies, arid plains, mountains, forests, and two huge mountain-chains-the Rocky and the Cascade Ranges.  Through the whole of this must an Atlantic and Pacific railway be carried when it is made, if it be made through the United States' Territory.  The railway works were extraordinary in perforating and climbing the Alleghanies.  Railways are now being made through the mountains in India, and in other places where tremendous obstacles have to be overcome, yet on none of the lines made or being made do such formidable barriers exist as are found between the Atlantic and Pacific States of the American union.  The present unhappy state of affairs-the waste of war-is draining the national exchequer dry, and deferring to a distant date the completion of the most important work the United States' Government has had in hand since the declaration of independence-the binding their eastern and western territory together with a band of iron.</p>
<p>Mr. W. H. Russell, of the firm of Russell, Major, and Waddel, extensive Government contractors for the conveyance of stores overland to the States on the west side of the Rocky Mountains, having observed the daily-increasing importance of a more rapid means of communication than then existed, hit upon the exceedingly bold idea of running a pony express from the Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean, carrying a telegram from New York, or any other part of the States, to San Francisco in eight days, and a letter in thirteen.  Those who knew the country through which the express must pass shook their heads, and said it would never do; the route was far north, the winter severe, the roads impassable, the snow lying often fifteen feet deep on the ground.  It then took  115 days to make a quick passage between New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Mr. Russell was not the man to set aside a plan he had made up his mind he could carry out by any multiplication of difficulties: he therefore prepared to make the attempt.  First he built stations all along the route and stocked them well and plentifully, then engaged a corps of fearless and trustworthy riders, and purchased about six hundred horses, the very best that money could procure.  Having done all this and a great deal more that was necessary, on April 9, 1860, two ponies started simultaneously, one from San Francisco, and the other from St. Joseph, on the Missouri; and, although the season was most unfavourable, the mud being in some places two or three feet deep, yet the entire distance, one thousand nine hundred miles, was run in seven days and a half, carrying dispatches from New York and San Francisco.  This performance is the more remarkable because the early part of April is considered the very worst season of the year: the snows on the mountains are deep, and on the plains the rivers are swollen and filled with floating ice.  Old mountaineers consider April as bad as any winter month on the mountains, and worse on the plains.  The pony express, being "un fait accompli,"  continued to run regularly with letters once a week from each end, traveling invariably to a time schedule, until the month of June, when a source of trouble appeared  which had long given cause for anxiety.  The wild Indians of the western plains began to meddle with the express, and shot dead from his horse one of the couriers.  His body was found a few days after, stripped of everything; but the bag of letters remained beside him untouched.  The horse and the firearms are what the Indians want, and they wisely consider that meddling with the letters would only unnecessarily irritate Uncle Sam without doing them any good.
The dangerous ground extended about three hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake, in Utah territory, west to Carson City.  In this district the inter-<pb n="387">ruptions became so incessant that it was considered necessary to "hand off the pony" from that particular section of the route.  On the other portions the express continued to run, delivering its letters at Salt Lake and Carson City, where they accumulated, waiting the first favourable opportunity to push through with safety.</p>

<p>Those unacquainted with the country west of the Rocky Mountains can scarcely appreciate the difficulty  and danger attending a journey through it.  For hundreds of miles it is a long dreary waste, inhabited only by bands of warlike Indians, who prowl about robbing and killing as they choose, and dotted at every fifteen miles of distance with the stations of the pony express, in charge of two or three persons. Occasionally  its monotony is broken by the passage of a train of emigrant <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> bound west to California or Oregon.  Night and day, heedless of the weather or the attacks of the redskins, the pony courier dashes along, at the rate of twelve miles an hour, his revolver in his belt, his hand on the trigger of his rifle, his eye watching intently for redskins, so that he may have the first shot; under him, on the saddle, is the bag of letters so anxiously looked forward to in New York, for they tell important things-how ships have sailed for Europe laden with Californian gold, of terrible wrecks and losses, or of rising markets and great gains, or perhaps how the votes have counted that decide the destiny of States.  Not only to America is this bold and solitary rider's leather saddle-bag of interest, but on to Europe will electricity and steam send many a long-looked-for message which it contains; and the merchant on many a change in the Old World will tell of news he has received so soon from the farthest shores of the Pacific.  He little knows, and less cares, for the hairbreadth dangers run by this lonely courier of the plains and mountains.  Altogether, the Pony Express Company have lost six men killed by the Indians.  They, however, provide liberally for the wives and families, if there be any.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that they have as yet lost only one mail, and this one was lost under peculiar circumstances.  The letters are inclosed in two leather bags, which are slung across the pony's back, and are kept in their place by the rider sitting on them, so that in case of anything happening to him the bags fall off and are recovered, though the pony scamper off and be lost.  In the case alluded to the rider had, against special instructions, fastened the bags to the saddle.  On a dark night in July, 1860, the express, bound east, on crossing the bridge over the Platt River, stumbled over an ox that had taken up its quarters there for the night, and was precipitated into the river.  The rider reached the shore, but the pony and the mails were gone no one knows wither, never having been heard of to this day.</p>
<p>The company have suffered severely from first to last by the depredations of the Indians; they are, however, now in a much better state.  The express was almost driven off the line west of Salt Lake City, their stations being burnt or otherwise destroyed, their people killed, and their horses stolen.  All, however, is now repaired and in better order than ever-the troops of the United States' Government and a force <orig reg="organized">organised</orig> by the company having driven the Indians away, and made them as scarce, and their occupation as dangerous, as it would be in the State of New York.</p>
<p>There is nothing very particular about either the pony or the rider: the riders are small, courageous, active young men, capable of great endurance; the ponies, or rather small horses, are the best description of animals for the purpose that can be procured.  There is nothing showy or ornamental about either riders or horses; yet they are very picturesque, and are evidentally got up entirely for business.  Our Artist saw one of the expresses arrive at St. Joe.  The young man who rode was a long, wiry, reddish-haired chap, who looked made to <orig reg="gallop">galop</orig> through the world on a horse's back.  He wore a red worsted shirt, a rowdy hat, and a long, light-blue great-coat, with a little cope and plenty of brass buttons.  This young man had ridden on one occasion two hundred miles in twenty-four hours without rest or food, except such as he could get on the <orig reg="pony's">poney's</orig> back.  The rider usually rides fifty miles, using two ponies, who run twenty-five miles each.</p>
<p>The pony express does not pay the running expenses directly, but the company continue it nevertheless, allowing a little extra time during the winter.</p>
<p>St. Joseph, or St. Joe, as it is irreverently called by the Americans, is a pretty good town situated on the east bank of the Missouri River: it is the western terminus of the <orig reg="Hannibal">Hanibal</orig> and St. Joe Railway, which completes the American system of railways westward.</p>
<p>St. Joe has much the same relation to the great plains that a seaport has to the ocean: it is the point of arrival and departure after a three-months' voyage overland of hundreds of travellers and <orig reg="wagon">waggon</orig>-trains who make the passage between California, Oregon, and the Western States of the Union.  The passage across the mountains and over the plains is as lonely as a voyage across the ocean.  Neither towns nor villages are met with, and the emigrant-train has to depend upon its own resources as much as a ship does while navigating the sea.</p>
<p>There is a wild look about the people at St. Joe.  Nearly everybody carries a rifle, and has that peculiar expression of countenance which indicates the possession of the ability to take care of himself and cut up particularly rough if interfered with.  Some awful roughs may be seen about occasionally, but these are held in good check by the respectable portion of the place; and, although St. Joe is a wild, out-of-the-way place, almost beyond the reach of the law, yet the people go about as safely, and carry on their business as securely, as if they were in the neighbourhood of Boston.  Should any of the border ruffian class attempt any villany, Lynch law would most likely cut short his career, and he might find himself hanging to the branch of a tree before he had time to engage counsel to prove his innocence of the crime which he was caught in the act of executing.  It is an event and a picturesque scene to see one of the long trains of <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> arrive from the westward, the people looking so brown and weather-worn and the children healthy and happy, and the rush all make immediately on certain shops and stores.  One great delight on the part of the men seems to be to get themselves shaved as clean as possible; fine bright-coloured shirts and handkerchiefs are immediately obtained and ostentatiously exhibited.</p>
<p>Market-day at St. Joe is a peculiar sight, and gives one a better idea of the back-settlement life than can be obtained anywhere else.  The farmer and his family, in their particular <orig reg="wagon">waggon</orig>, which, with the exception of the wheels, they have made themselves, are things to be seen.  There is no place in the United States where greater variety of character, interesting incidents, and opportunity for the study of human nature, exists to a greater extent than at St. Joe, on the Missouri.</p>

<p rend="center">JOURNEYS AND EXPLORATIONS IN THE COTTON KINGDOM. BY<lb/> 
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED.  Sampson Low and Son.</p>
<p>At this moment the word "cotton" sounds so ominously in the ears of political economists that it is not to be wondered at that publications on that subject are somewhat rife.  There is enough of anxiety and doubt with regard to this staple article of raw material to render any ststistical statements welcome, and to cause any amount of the cotton-growing regions of America to be interesting.  Mr. Olmstead's observations on cotton and slavery in the American Slave States, which, we are informed, are based on three former volumes of journeys and investigations by the same author, are written by a gentleman who went directly from his farm in the State of New York into the Slave States.  It is probable, therefore, that one qualification for this work-entire impartiality-may in some degree be wanting; but, on the whole, there does not appear to be any desire on the part of the writer to misrepresent or exaggerate. Perhaps the insensible influences at work in his mind are most brought to bear in his first chapter-on the "Present Crisis,"  and which is introductory to the rest of the work.  Here he starts with an assertion that the rest of the citizens of the United States have submitted to many indignities in order to preserve the tranquillity of the South; and, in answer to the dogma that the South can never be subjugated, he replies that it must, or the North must; that it must be, or not only is the American Republic a failure, but its English justice, its English law, and its English freedom are failures.  It need hardly be added that the whole argument in this chapter goes to show that slavery is beneficial neither to the proprietors of slaves nor to the cultivation of cotton.  He maintains that one of the grand errors out of which the rebellion of the South has grown came from supposing that whatever nourishes wealth and gives power to an ordinary <orig reg="civilized">civilised</orig> community must command as much for a slave-holding community.  He contends that the truth has been overlooked, that the accumulation of wealth and the power of a nation are contingent not merely upon the primary value of the surplus of productions of which it has to dispose, but very largely, also, upon the way in which the income from its surplus is distributed and reinvested.  "Let a man," he says, "be absent from any part of the North twenty years, and he is struck on his return by what are called 'improvements' which have been made-better buildings, churches, schoolhouses, mills, railroads, &c.  In New York City alone, for instance, at least two hundred millions of dollars have been reinvested merely in an improved housing of the people; in labour-saving machinery, waterworks, gasworks, and so on, as much more.  It is not difficult to see where the profits of the merchants and manufacturers are.  Again, go into the country and there is no end of substantial proof of twenty years of agricultural prosperity, not alone in roads, canals, bridges, dwellings, barns, and fences, but in books and furniture, and gardens and pictures, and in the better dress and evidently higher education of the people.  But where will the returning <orig reg="traveler">traveller</orig> see the accumulative cotton profits of twenty years in Mississippi?  Ask the cotton-planter for them, and he will point, in reply, not to dwellings and churches, libraries, schoolhouses, mills, railroads, or anything of the kind; he will point to his negroes-to almost nothing else.  Negroes such as stood for 500 dollars represent now 1000 dollars.  It is to Virginia and those Northern Slave States which have the monopoly of supplying negroes for the real wealth which the sale of cotton has brought to the South.  But where is the evidence of it?  where anything to compare with the evidence of accumulated profits to be seen in any free State?  If certain portions of Virginia have been a little improving, others unquestionably have been deteriorating-growing shabbier, more comfortless, less convenient.  The total increase in wealth of the population during the last twenty years shows almost for nothing.  One year's improvements of a Free State exceed it all."  Again the author observes:-"Whither the profits of cotton go it is not my purpose here to undertake to show.  I will barely notice the hypocritical statement made for the English market as an apology for the mad crime of  the slaveholders, that they are greatly absorbed  in contributions made by the Planting States to our national treasury in payments of duties on importations.  The cotton-planters pay duties only on what they consume of foreign goods.  A very large part of all our duties are collected on a class of goods for which there is almost no demand at all from the South, either directly or indirectly- <orig reg="woolen">woollen</orig> and fur goods, for instance.  Of the goods required for the South not a few have been practically free.  The whole slave population of the South consumes almost nothing imported (nor could it, while slave, under any circumstances).  The majority of the white population habitually makes use of no foreign production except chicory, which, ground with peas, they call coffee.  I have never seen reason to believe that with absolute free trade the Cotton States could take a tenth part of the value of our present importations; and, as far as I can judge from observation of the comparative use of foreign goods at the South and at the North, not a tenth part of our duties have been defrayed by the South in the last twenty years.  The most indefensible protective duty we have is one called for by the South, and which has been maintained solely to benefit the South.  Our protective system had a Southern origin, and its most powerful advocates have been Southerners, and there has not been a year in the last twenty in which it could have been maintained but for Southern votes."</p>
  <p> Having thus let Mr. Olmsted speak his opinions for himself, evidencing the spirit in which he most likely undertook his journey to the South, we proceed to state that his first <orig reg="traveling">travelling</orig> chapter begins at Washington, and it contains some not unamusing sketches of life and character in that capital.  It is stated that the coloured population voluntarily sustain several churches, schools, and mutual assistance and improvement societies, and there are evidently among them persons of no inconsiderable cultivation of mind.  Among the police reports of the city newspapers there appeared an account of the apprehension of tweny-four "genteel, coloured men" (so they were termed) who had been found by a watchman assembling privately in the evening, and had been lodged in the watchhouse.  The object of their meeting appeared to be purely benevolent, and when they were examined before a magistrate in the morning no evidence was offered, nor did there seem to be any suspicion that they had any criminal purpose.  On searching these persons there were found a Bible, a volume of "Seneca's Morals," "Life in Earnest," the printed constitution of a society the object of which was said to be "to relieve the sick and to bury the dead;" and a subscription-paper to purchase the freedom of Eliza Howard, a young woman whom her owner was willing to sell for 650 dols.  Characteristic enough all this; but it must be understood that these were not slaves.  The transit which our traveler next makes through Virginia is minutely set out with all its details of life and character, especial attention being paid to descriptions of negro life, habits, and status.  The conclusion to which he arrives with regard to the economic condition of the State may be summed in a phrase which he uses when he says that it is "shiftless."  As a whole, the community makes shift to live, some part tolerably, the most part wretchedly enough, with arrangements such as one might expect to find in a country in stress of war.  North Carolina is dealt with almost equally in detail, and fares no better in the author's opinion.  South Carolina and Georgia are next surveyed, and thence the route is through the south-west to Alabama and Mississippi on to Louisiana, and thence through Texas.  In Louisiana the sugar estates and the machinery meet with more favourable notice than usually characterises the writer's observations.  After a description of a passage through South-western Louisiana and Eastern Texas, a trip into Northern Mississippi, and the interior cotton districts of Central Mississippi, &c., the work treats of the exceptional large planters, of slavery in its property aspect, moral and religious instruction of the slaves; of slavery as a poor-law system, in which an elaborate comparison is given between the condition and sustentation of the Northern and Southern labourers.  The chapter on Cotton Supply and White Labour in the Cotton Climate is well worth consideration, as therein is argued the whole question whether the production of cotton depends on slave labour or not.  Equally interesting are the dissertations contained in the sections which relate to the condition and character of the privileged classes of the South, and that on the danger of the South.  That they are discussed in something of the tone of an advocate was to be expected; but the argument is so filled out with facts and statements of effects traceable to undoubted causes that those who read the work before us from a purely abstract and unconventional point of view will gain much-very much-on which to ground an unbiassed opinion.  In an appendix a collection of ststistics is given relating to the condition of Virginia;  but it was hardly to be expected that under the head of "The Slave Trade in Virginia" we should find reproduced only an extract from Chambers's Journal.  There are also some statistics of the Georgia seaboard.  It should be stated that the book, although dealing with very serious subjects, and treating them in a very serious spirit, is by no means a dry narrative of travel and a pedantic description of what was seen, and heard, and collected.  On the contrary, it is continually broken by lighter matter; and attempts-not wholly unsuccessful-have been made to give it in many parts a popular-that is, an amusing-tone.  As a whole, it will, we think, be found acceptable to those in this country-and they are many-who, watching the painful contest which is now going on in America, may desire some insight which they did not possess before into its motive causes.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="small caps">Y</hi> the steam-ship City of New York we have received advices from New York to the 5th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Confederate forces opposite Washington have evacuated their lines and fallen back on Manassas Junction.  The Federals have advanced and occupied the deserted positions.  Great devastation was committed by the Federal troops on the property of the resident population, quite irrespective of their politics.  General M'Clellan has issued an order denouncing these excesses, and menacing the perpetrators with the penalty of death.  The intrenchments thrown up by the Confederates were of a very inferior kind, and excite the contempt of the Unionists.</p>
<p>The telegram published in the daily journals that General Mansfield had "surprised" General Wool at Fortress Monroe is a mistake, and must mean "succeeded," as General Wool has left Fort Monroe for Washington, and General Mansfield is a Federal General, lately chef d'&eacute:tat under General Scott.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia the Federals have had two successful engagements with the Confederates.  In that which took place in the Kanawha Valley they claim to have killed sixty of the Confederates and to have taken seventy prisoners.</p>
<p>In Kentucky a new and immense battle-field has been opened.  From Cumberland Gap on the east, to the Mississippi on the west-a distance of more than 300 miles, the Confederates occupy a line of posts.  In Northern Kentucky they are confronted by a parallel line of Union camps.  General Anderson, who is in feeble health, has been superseded in command of the Federal forces in Kentucky by General Sherman.  A collision may occur at any moment.</p>
<p>General Fremont has taken the field in Missouri, and is in pursuit of General Price.  General Price has evacuated Lexington and gone southward, hoping to cut off General Siegel.  Lexington is again occupied by Federal troops.  General Price reports that his entire loss in the capture of Lexington was 25 killed and 72 wounded.  About 3500 prisoners, including 4 colonels, 1 major, and 118 other commissioned officers, 5 pieces of artillery and 2 mortars, over 33,000 stand of infantry arms, a large number of sabers, about 750 horses, many sets of cavalry equipments, <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, teams, ammunition, more than 100,000 dollars' worth of commissary stores, the great seal of state, the public records, and about 900,000 dollars in money were the fruits of this victory.  The money was restored to the bank from which the Federalits had taken it.</p>
<p>The report that several vessels had run the blockade at the mouth of the Mississippi is unfounded; but the British steamer Bermuda, freighted with blankets and warm clothing for the Confederate army, had succeeded in getting into Savannah.  She cleared from Liverpool for the West Indies.  The Federal gun-boat Fanny, of which a Sketch is given in our Issue this week (at page 411), has been captured by the Confederates inside Hatteras, near Roanoke Island.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL FREMONT'S POSITION.</p>

<p>Colonel Blair has been released from custody on the order of General Scott, as General Fremont neglected to file his charges against the insubordinate Colonel.  A rumour prevailed that he had been removed from his command by the authorities at Washington.  Great excitement at St. Louis was the result.  Recruiting offices were closed, and indignation meetings were called.  A telegram from Mr. Seward, assuring the people that General Fremont was not ordered to Washington, nor was any court-martial ordered concerning him, quieted the public apprehensions.</p>
<p>The course of the President in <orig reg="canceling">cancelling</orig> the liberating clause of General Fremont's proclamation is still much canvassed by the public.   The Democrats and Conservative Republicans support the President; the Abolitionists and Radical Republicans support Fremont.  Parker Pillsbury writes in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Slavery Standard</hi>:-"political flumes, floodgates, and embankments are now all swept away, and one whelming deluge of devotion to the Union, <hi rend="italic">as it was</hi>, with slavery eternised, is now sweeping over the country from ocean to ocean.  Only the pebble-stone protest of a few faithful Abolitionists (alas, how very few!) any longer obstruct its terrible course."</p>

<p rend="center">ARMY NEWS.</p>

<p>The Governor of Iowa having commensed to draft troops, the Secretary of War has forbidden the practice, expressing his confidence in the patriotism of the people to supply volunteers enough for the war.  The State of New York has not yet contributed two-thirds of the 25,000 men demanded of her under the last call for volunteers.  Recruiting for the regular army is an entire failure, not above six men a week being obtained in New York City.  The Government find no difficulty in obtaining sailors.  The reports of the sick and wounded in the Federal hospitals at Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria on the 27th ult. showed the number remaining to be 961.  There was a great scarcity of blankets for the Federal army, and the Quartermaster-General was calling on the public to furnish supplies.</p>

<p rend="center">TRADE AND FINANCE.</p>

<p>The second <orig reg="installment">instalment</orig> of 50,000,000 dollars has been taken by the banks of the three principal Atlantic cities, in the old proportion and on the old terms-namely, 7-10ths by New York, 2-10ths by Boston, and 1-10th by Philadelphia.  The public, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 21, had taken 18,934,000 dols. of the loan, which was paid back by the Government to the banks.  This sum had been taken in this ratio:-At New York, 10,640,000 dols.; Boston, 5,000,000 dols; Philadelphia, 2,294,000 dols.; other agencies, say, 1,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>The export of grain to England and France continues very large, and exchange on England has fallen to 107.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FREE NEGROES.</p>

<p>The following statistics of the free blacks resident in the United and Confederate States have been compiled from the recent census returns.  The number in the free-labour States, the district of Columbia, and the Territories is 223,073; in the adhering Slave States, 116,750; in the eleven Seceded States, 131,401:  grand total, 481, 115.  The free blacks in the Free-labour States are thus distributed.  The six New England States, 23,141; New York, 47,998; New Jersey, 24,947; Pennsylvania, 56,373; Ohio, 36,225; Indiana, 10,869; six other North-Western States, 17,248;  California and Oregon, 3947; district of Columbia, 11,107; the Territories, 229.  In the adhering Slave States-Maryland, 83,718; Delaware, 19,723; Kentucky, 10,146; Missouri, 2982.  In the Seceded States there are-Virginia, 57,579; North Carolina, 30,097; Louisiana, 18,638; South Carolina, 9648;  seven other Confederate States, 15,439.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, OCTOBER</hi> 19,1861</p>
<p>Beyond a general impression that a battle on the Potomac must be impending, there is not much in the recent dispatches from the States.  The complaints of the cowardice of the Home Guards in the Lexington affair are reiterated, and the surrender of the place would, it seems clear, have been delayed but for the conduct of these volunteers.  The position, however, had become untenable, and there was no excuse for a further sacrifice of the lives of brave men.  Why two of the Orleans Princes have been permitted to join in the struggle it is hard to say.  "The smell of powder has drawn them in the right direction," writes a Prince at home here; but the explanation is slightly vague.  Even the North itself can hardly regard the act as a dignified one, the war being regarded in the Lincoln light of a great police demonstration.  But there is, of course, an intention to make capital somehow, and it may be held that the supposed necessity of keeping a name upon the tongue of France has instigated a step which looks like a mistake.  Only the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> is delighted, because the enlistment of the Princes will, it is thought, be displeasing to the "British aristocracy," whose "gold, lavished upon fanatic abolitionists, has got up the war"-such is the trash printed for American mobs.  Be it added, that though this organ of public opinion is reasonably delighted at the enlisting of two real Princes, it adds a divertingly pathetic appeal to other officers not to be too proud to associate with certain German Volunteer Colonels merely because they are also beershop-keepers.  The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> justly remarks that there is nothing dishonourable in selling beer.  Certainly not, if the beer is good;-and what was Oliver Cromwell?</p>

<p> As the exact and official returns of the Census are being made public, we behold more clearly (says the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>) the precise march and direction of the population which has been filling up, during the last ten years, the unoccupied territory of the Union.  Its grand and main course is westward, with some currents to the north-west and some to the south-west.  The flood of population over some of our new States in the Far West has probably never been <orig reg="equaled">equalled</orig> in the history of emigration, both in the character of the emigrants and in the number placed upon new soil, where before were the animals of the prairie and the forest and the roving Indian.</p>
<p>Minnesota, for instance, increases from 6077 inhabitants in 1850 to 162,022  in 1860, or at the rate of increase of over 2500 percent; Oregon, from  18,294 to 52,464, or at the rate of 294 per cent; Iowa, from 192,214 to 674,948, or at 251.22 per cent; Texas, from 212,592 to 602,432, or 183.37 per cent; Wisconsin, from 305,391 to 775,873, or 154.06 per cent; Arkansas increases 107 per cent, and Illinois over 100 per cent.</p>
<p>The average rate of the growth of population in all the States the last decade is 35.02 per cent.  There are nineteen States below this average, the lowest in order being Vermont, 0.32 per cent; then New Hampshire, 2.55 per cent; and next South Carolina, 5.28; Maine following with 7.73; and Tennessee with 11.68, and once powerful Virginia with only 12.27, while North Carolina shows only 14.23.  There are eleven States counting 19,528,555 inhabitants, or an average of more than one million and a half each-namely, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee, Missouri, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia.</p>
<p>In territories the greatest advance is, of course, in Utah, or 254.07 per cent; in New Mexico it reaches 51.98.</p>
<p>The black current must always be the important one to the statistician of this continent.  The Census reveals a steady stream of negroes from the seaboard towards the south-west.  Virginia retains her old pre-eminence as the breeder of slaves for market, in which <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> occupation she is apparently closely followed by South Carolina, while the States whither this disgusting traffic tends are Arkansas, Mississippi, and especially Texas.  The average increase of slaves is moderately large, or 23.42 per cent.  There is a loss in but two States-Delaware (of 21.48 per cent.) and Maryland (3.52).  The increase in Virginia is only 3.88 per cent, and in South Carolina 5.28-this small advance evidently resulting from exportation.  Kentucky, too, shows an increase of but 4.87 per cent the last decade, which gives a most gratifying prospect of the destiny of the system in  Kentucky, as it is believed no very important numbers have been exported during the last ten years from that State.  North Carolina only exhibits an advance of 14.74, and Tennessee of 15.17 per cent.  Missouri presents a larger increase than was expected-namely, 31.51.  The great increase is in Texas, where it reaches over 210 per cent (210.66); in Arkansas it is 135.89; in Florida, 57.09; and in Mississippi, 40.93.</p>
<p>In two States only are the slaves more numerous than the whites-in South Carolina, where they number 402,541, against 291,623 of the white inhabitants; and in Mississippi, being 436,696 to 353,969 whites.  Their largest number in any one State is in Virginia (490,887), and the next in Georgia (462,232).</p>
<p>In the territories there are 10 slaves enumerated in Nebraska, 24 in New Mexico, and 29 in Utah.  The district of Columbia shows a loss of slaves of 13.72 per cent.</p>
<p>Among the free coloured population the increase is very small through the Union-only 10.63 per cent.  Their largest numbers are to be found, as usual, in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Little valuable in a statistical point of view is to be extracted from the tables of this population, as the dimunition from banishment or emigration cannot be distinguished from that arising from natural and regular causes.  The theory sustained recently by an able statistician in Washington (Mr. Weston), that the free negro inevitably diminishes on this continent, is not yet sufficiently confirmed by facts to be admitted as a satisfactory scientific hypothesis.  The race undoubtedly dies out in climates not adapted to it-as, for instance, in the Northern States; but whether it decays in freedom in the middle or Southern latitudes does not yet fully appear.  In many of the Southern and Western States there are laws expelling the free negroes, and their decrease observed in those States during the last decade may be due to these extraneous causes.  Their greatest increase in a Slave State is in Georgia (18.01 per cent); in Alabama, 16.11; in Maryland, 12.04; the greatest decrease in Arkansas, 77.47.  Greatest increase in a Free State, in Minnesota, 487.18 per cent; in New York they lose 2.18 per cent.</p>
<p>It will probably be many decades before we shall show such a rapid growth of numbers as in the last.  The next Census will, no doubt, reveal new currents and new directions in our population.  Instead of streams from east to west, we may then have many from  north to south, and new results to chronicle in regard to the movements or decrease of the black population.</p>

<hi rend="center">DESTRUCTION OF FORT OCRACOKE, ON BEACON ISLAND,<lb/>
 NORTH CAROLINA</hi>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the 16th ult. an expedition left Fortress Monroe to take and destory the fort on Beacon Island, near the entrance to the Sound.  It was under the command of Lieutenant Eastman, of the Pawnee, and consisted of sixty-five men from the Coast Guard, and a detachment of sailors and marines from the Pawnee, in the ship's launch.  The Coast Guard were on board the Fanny, which towed the launch down.  The landing was safely effected.  The fort was found deserted.  The remainder of the day and the next day were occupied in destroying the pieces of ordnance found in the fort, of which twenty-two were rendered unserviceable.  The torch was then applied to the bombproofs and magazines, and also to the lighthouse on the island.  The conflagration raged furiously all night, the light being plainly visible thirty miles distant.  After having completed the destruction of the fort, the expedition returned to Fort Monroe without the loss of a man.</p>

<hi rend="center">CONFEDERATE DESERTER COMING INTO THE FEDERAL LINES AT<lb/>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Federal camp writes as follows respecting the second Engraving:-On the 19th inst., while I was out at the extreme advanced picket in front of the Confederate position at Munson's Hill, I was much startled by a sudden popping all along the enemy's line, the bullets pinging over our heads in every direction.  Raising myself cautiously I saw a Confederate soldier bounding through the tall Indian corn, and making for our lines, while two hundred yards behind him his former comrades were doing their best to stop his career.  He ran the gauntlet without a single shot taking effect, and turned out to belong to the 13th Virginian Regiment.  He told us that Jefferson Davis and Beauregard were on the hill reconnoitring, and that there were 180,000 Confederates between that post and Fairfax.</p>

A horse's length in advance sat the smallest man of the party, broad-shouldered, strong-chested, strong-necked, and strong-jawed, one hand upon his hip, while the other, by an occasional rapid motion flung some communication to the passing squadrons of calvary. The visor of his cap was well pulled down over his eyes, yet not a man in the lines escaped his observation. His glance seemed to take in at once the whole spectacle, yet without <orig reg="losing">loosing</orig> any of its smallest details. "He is a commander," said my Austrian friend. Something in his figure, his attitude, and the square, tenacious set of his jaws, reminded me strikingly of Field-Marshal Radetsky. I scanned the lines of his face in vain for some mark of weakness, indecision, or timidity. All was cool, firm, prompt, determined, and self-reliant. If he does not justify the hopes and expectations of the nation, physiognomy is of no value.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Edinburgh we have New York journals to the 12th inst., and a short telegram from Cape Race to the evening of the 15th.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The scene of active operations has shifted for the moment from the land to the ocean.  At Hatteras Inlet, after some fluctuations of fortune, victory remains with the Federals.  The particulars of the capture of the propeller Fanny have been reported.  She was on her way from the inlet to Chicomacomica, the encampment of a Federal regiment, and was captured by three Confederate tugs which put out from Roanoke Island.  Two rifled cannon, twenty-five prisoners, and a cargo of commissary stores fell into the hands of the captors.  Emboldened by this success, on the 7th  inst., a Confederate expedition, said by the Northerners to have consisted of six  steamers and 3000 men, attacked the Federal camp near Hatteras Inlet.  The Federals retreated, carrying away their tents and provisions and leaving fifty prisoners.  Two Federal steamers afterwards arrived with assistance and shelled the Confederates who had landed, forcing them to return to their steamers with heavy loss.  Two of the Confederate vessels were sunk.</p>
<p>A telegram to Cape Race reports from Norfolk, a Southern source be it remembered, what, if not exaggerated, more than compensates for the above disaster.  The Confederate fleet of gun-boats, which had been long preparing for the event, attacked the blockading squadron at New Orleans, and after a sharp fight had sunk one Federal vessel and driven the rest ashore.  Just before this attack the Federals had occupied Ship Island and constructed fortifications on the Head Passes of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>A large naval force, consisting of twenty ships, left New York for some point on the southern coast on the afternoon of the 12th inst.  Its exact destination was carefully kept secret from the public.</p>
<p>The army of the Potomac is slowly advancing its outposts.  The Confederates retire before them.  On the Upper Potomac all is quiet.  In Western Virginia, further Federal successes on a small scale are reported.  In Kentucky the hostile forces have not yet come into collison.  In Missouri, General Fremont has left St. Louis to take the field in pursuit of General Price.  He will march from twenty-five to forty miles a day, and, if necessary, will enter Arkansas.  Mr. Russell, writing on the 4th inst., assures impatient people in England "that no movement is at present contemplated in front of Washington; but that, before the month is over, land and sea will resound once more with the tumult of battle."</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda, whose entrance into Savannah in spite of the blockade we noticed last week, carried in a very valuable cargo.  She contained eighteen rifled cannon of 32 and 42 pounders; two Lancaster guns of 168lb. weight; powder, shot, and shells for the ordnance; 6500 Enfield rifles; from 200,000 to 300,000 cartridges; 6000 pairs of army shoes; 20,000 blankets;  180 barrels of gunpowder;  and a large quantity of morphine, quinine, and other medical stores: in all, worth 1,000,000 dollars.  Remonstrances against her sailing were made by Mr. Adams in London, but the British Foreign Office did not see its obligation to interfere.</p>
<p>The Richmond papers state that the steamer Nashville, with Messrs. Mason and Slidell (the Confederate Commissioners to Europe) on board, ran the blockade at Charleston on the 12th inst.</p>
<p>Several British vessels have been brought before United States' prize courts on the charge of attempting to evade the blockade; and all, without exception, have been condemned.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis continues in very feeble health, and the politicians are  looking about for a successor.  </p>
<p>The Governor of Louisiana has forbidden the entry of cotton into New Orleans, whether by steamer or railroad.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EXPEDITION TO MEXICO.</p>

<p>The New York journals look with great displeasure upon the prospect of order being restored in Mexico by a European intervention.  The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> believes that the United States' Government would not consent to proceedings which might eventually embroil America with the allied powers.  The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> expresses itself as follows:-</p>
<p>But it is very certain that after it takes place Mexico will cease to be an independent Power, and European interests will assume to direct her policy and control her destiny.  That we can contemplate such a prospect with indifference is out of the question.  It interferes too directly and seriously with our traditions and our <hi rend="italic">hopes</hi>, as well as with our direct and immediate interests, not to enlist our warmest anxieties.  If we were at peace and united among ourselves, we should unquestionably throw our whole weight against such a project, and even resist by force of arms the attempt to plant hostile institutions and a hostile policy in the pathway of our progress.  Whether we can safely pursue the same course now is a matter by no means free of doubt.  . . . One thing is very certain, our Government must not leave the foreign Powers who have formed this coalition in any doubt as to the sentiments we entertain in regard to their policy.  We must protest against it with all the directness and energy which the emergency requires.  How much further we may go in resisting it must depend on the contingencies of the future.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The American polar expedition arrived at Halifax on the 9th inst.  They were unable to penetrate through Smith's Straits, either this summer or last, on account of the heavy ice.  By means of dog-sleds, however, they succeeded in penetrating as far as latitude 81 deg. 35 min., on the west side of Kennedy Channel.</p>
<p>At the annual election in the State of Ohio the Union party has prevailed over the Democrats by a large majority.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Toronto, Canada West, to New York, says that Colonel Rankin, member of the Provincial Parliament, had been arrested in that city for having violated the Enlistment Act,  Colonel Rankin had been endeavouring to raise a regiment of lancers for the service of the United States' Government.</p>
<p>The Quartermaster-General has made an appeal to the people to furnish blankets, gratis or otherwise, for the use of the army, as they cannot be manufactured quickly enough.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LAST COTTON CROP.</p>

<p>The last cotton year closed on the 31st of August.  The total crop was 3,656,086 bales, being a deficiency of  1,013,684 bales on the crop of 1859-60, and of 194,395 bales on that of 1858-9.  The total exports to Great Britain amount to 2,175,225 bales, being 494,207 bales short of the previous year.  France falls short only 11,524 bales of last year; other foreign ports 78,882 bales; while the takings of American spinners amount to 650,357 bales against 786,521 bales last year.</p>

<p>W<hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi>  have news from America, but it is not very trustworthy as regards details.  It would seem, however, that the South has made an attempt to recover Fort Hatteras, and that such attempt has been unsuccessful.   The telegrams that announce the sinking of three of the Confederate steamers and the destruction of seven hundred men must be received with caution-indeed, the number of soldiers who have been slain-on paper-since the war began would make a great army, and we shall never know what quantity of commiseration to offer until the next Census is taken.  General M'Lellan is said to be now "ready," and, therefore, large and various operations may be heard of very soon.  The Southerners take no pains to keep the Old World aware of their real position and prospects, and therefore must not complain that we take all our impressions on the subject from their enemy: it is rational, however, to make liberal deduction from Northern accounts.  We have been amused, and probably our cousins on both sides of the Potomac will be equally diverted, with an offer of mediation which has been put forth.  Mr. Smith O'Brien, a returned convict, who was exported for a ridiculous treason, in which he behaved with more prudence than valour, and which was terminated by his being found hiding, like an overgrown slug, among the cabbages in a cottage garden, has undertaken to go over to America and adjust the differences between the North and South.  When his proposal shall be accepted we shall, no doubt, be officially informed of the fact.  An almost equally amusing incident has occurred on the other side of the water.  The petty spitefulness of some American who has been displeased with Mr. William Russell's letters induced the former to watch the Englishman's movements, and was rewarded by detecting Mr. Russell, a keen sportsman, in a violation of a little local ordinance.  An information was laid, and the magistrates had no alternative-a fine was imposed; and the Americans in court showed their sense of the meanness of the motives which dictated the prosecution by instantly offering to unite in paying the fine.  They may be quite sure that Englishmen, if they remember the first part of the affair, will do so only for the sake of the pleasure of remembering the second.</p>

<p>D<hi rend="smallcaps">URING</hi> the coming winter America is destined to be the theatre of many stirring events.

The misgivings which could not be suppressed in the minds of many concerning the justifiableness of our late intervention in the affairs of China do not and cannot exist in the present instance.  Those most inclined to dispute the justice or deny the policy of high-handed proceedings on our part towards other nations refuse to become the advocates of Mexico.  British residents plundered at pleasure and murdered with impunity at the rate of a score a year, British creditors not only systematically defrauded of their rights but robbed even of a small instalment of pecuniary justice which had been placed under the protection of the Legation itself, the faith of treaties and special conventions so consistently flouted as to make further negotiation a mockery, and the fact that these wrongs were perpetuated not by one party merely, but by all of the more than semi-barbarous factions which dispute for an ephemeral sway inthe "halls of Montezuma," furnish a catalogue of grievances such as, happily, is not often presented for the consideration of a British Cabinet.  Neither of our proposed co-partners in this expedition has so many claims for redress.  Some of the British claims date back to 1834, but France seized Vera Cruz in 1838, and obtained 600,000 dollars in payment of all demands to that date,  She has likewise obtained several "conventions" since that time-conventions to which more respect has probably been shown than to those which the offending State has entered into with Great Britain.  Whatever other outrages Spain may have to allege, it is certain Spaniards have not advanced to the Mexican Government &pound:12,000,000, and that their claims for injuries received do not amount to anything like the enormous sum of 21,000,000 dollars; indeed, the British merchants, whose petition stimulated our Government into action, hint very broadly that the life and property of an Englishman in Mexico are held cheaper by the natives than those of any other people in the world.</p>
<p>The astonished public may well ask why things have been suffered to come to this pass? why outrage has been heaped upon outrage, and nothing been avenged? why the national honour has been allowed to suffer in the eyes of our own citizens and of the rest of the world?  What an empty boast seems that <hi rend="italic">Romanus civis</hi> declaration of Lord Palmerston when put in apposition with the history of British transactions with the first of Spanish American Republics!  It is manifestly inconsistent for the Government to bombard Athens in behalf of Don Pacifico; to exact redress for a single Englishman cut down by an Austrian saber in a Tuscan city; to obtain compensation for two English engineers taken on board the filibustering steamer Cagliari; and leave unavenged a hundred cases worse than any of these which have happened in Mexico.  In Europe and the Orient the British Government have been acting on Roman principles; in America they seem to have taken to heart the doctrines of the Sermon on the Mount in their literal sense, and to have presented their cheek to the smiter.  Again, it may be asked, whence this incongruity?</p>
<p>The mystery is easily dispelled.  We find the solution in the policy of the United States' Government.  The Cabinet of Washington have said "Hands off!"  whenever a British or Spanish intervention was threatened.  The United States have acted as the great protectors of anarchy in Mexico.  The arrogant "Monroe doctrine," to the effect that no European Power shall wield influence in the Western World, has been jealously enforced against Britain and Spain in favour of Mexico.  The Mexican anarchs have not been slow to appreciate the advantages of their position and to indulge in license where that license could only be chastised at the fearful price of a war with the United States.  The wrongs which British residents and creditors have received at the hands of Mexicans, heavy as they are, were trifles compared with the consequences of letting loose upon British America those 500,000 volunteers who are now arrayed in hostile camps on the Potomac, the Ohio, and the Mississippi.  This consideration bade our Government pause.  It was doubtless good policy to suffer meekly; our predominant interests demanded it; but it is impossible to overlook the fact that, in so acting, we have sacrificed the national honour to the national interest.  We need hardly add that in protecting ruffianism in Mexico the United States Government and people have been actuated by no kindly motives towards Mexico.  She has been their "sick man," and held the same position towards them that Poland in the latter half of the eighteenth, and Turkey in the former part of this century, occupied in respect to Russia.  Indeed this analogy has often been suggested as one of the mysterious bonds which linked so strongly together the great serf empire of the East and the great Slave Republic of the West.  Little Poland, however, only afforded food for three partitions.  The original gigantic proportions of Mexico (including as they did Texas, New Mexico, and California) gave material for two annexations, and still left enough for two or three repetitions of the process.  Such a monster could not be swallowed whole.  It was necessary for the anaconda to rest awhile and digest.  In the meantime, and before any action has been taken on Mr. Buchanan's proposition of occupying the frontier provinces of their neighbour, the anaconda itself is severed into two parts:  the protector is occupied at home with internecine quarrels, quarrels which suggest the idea that, in appropriating portions of Mexican territory, he had himself become assimilated somewhat to the Mexican in character, and the anarchs suddenly find themselves at the mercy of those they have so long injured with impunity.  For this long-desired opportunity we may safely acknowledge our indebtedness to the politicians of the cotton States, and credit them with it as a small set-off against the serious injury with which their hotheaded policy has already visited, and the still worse calamities with which it threatens to visit, the manufacturing classes of Europe.  Busily occupied as the United States are, we already hear the Anglo-French-Spanish expedition politely characterised as "an unholy combination," "an unnatural alliance"-words which issue with bad grace from the lips of those who have just warmly applauded the sentiment of the Czar of Russia that Russia and the United States, "placed at the extremities of two worlds, both in the ascending periods of their development, appear called to a natural community of interests and of sympathies, of which they have already given mutual proofs to each other."</p>
<p>   The fact that the expedition is to be a joint one causes some regrets of another kind at home.  The combination is not denounced as "unholy," but is pronounced "unpleasant."  Joint-stock operations with France are said to result in the disadvantage and discredit of this country.  We cannot so interpret the memorable passages in modern history to which allusion is made.  Did Anglo-French co-operation against Russia terminate in an unsatisfactory peace?  More recently, did the same combination so terminate in the case of China?  In both cases the triumph was achieved in a comparatively short space of time.  It is true that the army and navy of the two countries do feel a little mutual repulsion; but this consideration is a trifling one, and cannot be allowed to stand in the way of great measures of public policy demanded by the industrial spirit of the age in which we live.  That the dominant tendencies of this century urge upon both the French and the British nations a cordial and frequent co-operation we cannot doubt.  There was an invasion panic in England in 1852.  Armies and fleets were reviewed in mutual distrust, if not defiance, on each side of the Channel.  The superficial public opinion of the hour marked out those armaments as destined to be used against each other.  But the progress of events threw irony on these speculations.  The forces of the two nations were destined to fight side by side in the Crimea, the Black Sea, and the Baltic.  Again; since 1858 the invasion panic has become almost endemic here; the two nations, it is said, have been arming against each other.  Nevertheless, the voice of the mercantile community in China urged upon the home Governments the expediency of a joint war in that quarter of the globe, and the forces of the two nations again fought side by side; and, lastly, a similar demand from a similar class arises in reference to Mexico.  The merchants urgently recommend a <hi rend="italic">joint</hi>  expedition as the best means of effecting the righteous object they have in view.  In our querulousness at the Anglo-French alliance let us beware that we are not kicking against the highest tendencies and the most radical requirements of our generation.</p>
<p>   It is no drawback if Spain should be added to the combination.  This is not the first time that England, France and Spain have acted in unison on American questions.  Cuba has been preserved to Spain these ten years by an Anglo-French guarantee.  It is well, moreover, for the cause of Western civilization that out Teutonic and Protestant nation should be drawn closer to its Latin and Catholic neighbours.  The policy of isolation has endured long enough, and has cost Western Europe many calamities.  The same principle which in industrial pursuits gives birth to joint-stock companies and co-operative stores, and in social life to associations of all kinds unknown to our forefathers, forces upon us, sometimes it may be in spite of ourselves, the adoption of an analogous course in the elevated region of diplomacy and international politics.  Combined action has this additional advantage in that it affords less ground for the suspicion that the enterprise begun with laudable motives be prosecuted for the baser purpose of  selfish aggrandisement.   It is rumoured that Spain, inflamed by her success in Morocco and by the windfall of St. Domingo, is meditating the revival of the projects of Hernando Cortez.  Association with Britain and France will impose moderation on the vaulting ambition of Iberian statesmen and will be a guarantee to the rest of the world that the original purpose of the expedition will be sincerely and scrupulously adhered to.  "The age of conquest is over," says Napoleon III., and nothing is a surer sign of the truth of this aphorism than the prevalence of  associated action for the settlement of international difficulties, and the discredit into which an isolated and individualistic policy is falling.</p>
<p>   "There is many a slip between the cup and the lip," and it is by no means impossible that France and Spain may act independently of Great Britain.The British merchants prayed for the occupation of the city of Mexico by a small force of European troops.  This idea is said to find favour with the French Government, with whom a fondness for "occupations" is traditional.If that Government have troops they are willing to "expend" in Mexico, it is not the British residents who will object to their presence.  But Earl Russell sets his face against implicating this country in this course.  He thinks a very large force would be insufficient to restore public tranquility.  Foreign interference of this kind is only beneficial when a large and numerous party in the country is prepared to welcome foreign aid.  There is no such party in Mexico.  The British Government will therefore confine itself to demanding "respect for the persons and property of British subjects, and the fulfillment of recorded obligations."  Such is the argument of the British Foreign Secretary.  It is easy to see that the "fulfillment of recorded obligations" may be ensured by the administration of the customs of Vera Cruz and the other ports of Mexico, and the application of the moneys to those creditors to whom by special treaty they are due; but how the British Government propose to make good their demand for the "respect of the persons and property of British subjects" resident in the interior is not so clear.  Already we are warned by the Europeans in the interior towns of Mexico that, if the military operations are confined to the coast, their position will be rendered more precarious than ever.  The natives, unable to oppose the foreigner on the coast, will, we are told, avenge themselves on the defenceless foreigners in their midst.  These appeals are worthy of consideration, and may lead Earl Russell to consent to the desired occupation.  In the meantime we bespeak for the Mexican expedition, whether joint or several, the favour of the English public.  It will sail in the interest of order, <orig reg="civilization">civilisation</orig>, and humanity, and will vindicate the national honour and prestige in a part of the world where it has long been suffered to droop.  It will rehabilitate the legitimate influence of Europe in the Western World, and confound the pretensions of the partisans of the Monroe doctrine.  It may, indeed, help Mr. Gladstone's very small margin of estimated surplus to disappear; but England has so long allowed pecuniary considerations to override those of honour in her relations with Mexico that she may consider herself fortunate in being able at the present juncture to renew her credit there at a small immediate outlay.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Confederates having evacuted Munson's-hill, and other positions before Washington, they have been occupied, as previously reported, by the Federals as far as Lewinsville.  A great part of the defences of the Confederates were make-believe, painted logs for guns, and so forth.  The scene at the top of the hill, in the earthwork itself, was (says one account) one of the most amusing that could be imagined.  Everybody was laughing.  The utter absurdity of the works as means of defence, their smallness, meanness, insignificance, touched everybody's sense of the ludicrous.  The inclosure comprises about four acres, around which earth is roughly thrown up to a height of perhaps four feet.  Of course there is no ditch, no glacis-nothing, in fact, to give it the character of a fortification of any kind.  It is not even regular in form, but coils loosely and waveringly about the ground, as a huge snake might enfold it.  In every respect it looks a squirmy piece of work.  There are no embrasures for guns, but upon two of its projections are mounted-what? guns?  No, indeed, but old logs, with a black circle painted in the centre of the sawed part to represent a formidable armament.  At such a distance as that of Bailey's-roads the deception might very easily have remained undetected.  In the middle of this wretched "fort" the remains of a hastily-constructed hut still stood, but, with the exception of a few trees, it contained nothing else.  Behind it, on the slope of the hill, were a group of irregular shanties, thrown together for the protection of troops.  Their number was sufficient for the accommodation of about one regiment-certainly not more.</p>
<p> Our special Artist has sent us three Sketches, herewith engraved, in connection with the advance of the Federalists on Munson's-hill.  At the left of the last Illustration is depicted Count de Paris (alias Captain Louis d'Orleans), and next to him is the Duc de Chartres (alias Captain Robert d'Orleans), both of whom are on General M'Clellan's Staff.</p>

  <p> By the steamer City of Washington we have received New York journals to the 18th ult., and a short telegram from Cape Race to the 22nd.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The report of the discomforture of the Federal blockading squadron off New Orleans is not believed by the Navy Department at Washington.  It is, however, reiterated with greater circumstantiality in the following despatch of  Commander Hollins, of the Confederate States' Navy:-</p>
<quote rend="blockquote">F<hi rend="smallcaps">ORT</hi> J<hi rend="smallcaps">ACKSON</hi>, Oct. 12.-Last night I attacked the blockaders with my little fleet.  I succeeded after a very short struggle in driving them all aground in the South-west Pass Bar, except the Preble, which I sunk.  I captured a prize from them, and after they were fast in the sand I peppered them well.  There were no casualities on our side.  It was a complete success.</quote>
<p rend="right">(Signed)    HOLLINS.</p>

<p>A dispatch from New Orleans, dated the 13th, says the force of the Federal fleet was 40 guns and nearly 1000 men, while the Confederate fleet was 16 guns and 300 men.</p>
<p>   The great naval expedition which has been preparing at New York and Boston for some weeks will rendezvous at Annapolis, on the Chesapeake, and take on board there its last quota of troops and artillery.  Among the transports attached to this expedition are the finest steamers of the late Collins and Vanderbilt lines.</p>
<p>   The Federal Commodore who allowed the Nashville to escape from Charleston with the Southern Commissioners has been superseded.</p>
<p>   A force of Confederates was landed on Santa Rosa Island, off Pensacola, and stormed the encampment of a New York regiment stationed there.  They destroyed all the tents, captured a large amount of rations, stores, and ammunition, and spiked all the guns placed in position.</p>
<p>   Detailed accounts of the Confederate assault on the encampment on  Hatteras Inlet show that the loss suffered by the Confederates was much exaggerated.  The Monticello shelled and sunk two of the retiring bateaux, "containing, it is judged, about fifty men each."</p>
<p>   On the Potomac General M'Clellan advances but slowly.  The Confederates have evacuated Vienna, destroyed the railroad, and fallen back on Fairfax Court House.  Two English officers who were present at the review of M'Clellan's artillery and cavalry on the 8th ult report "the artillery fair, horses light; batteries rather a mixture, longs and shorts, rifled and smooth bores; carriages heavy, harness not well kept nor clean, but strong and serviceable; men strong and serviceable too, but not well set up; headdress condemned.  Report on cavalry not so favourable.  Men don't ride; no seats, no setting up, nothing clean; horses rather mixed; saddlery  and equipments-including swords, scabbards, spurs, bits, and metalwork-generally very dirty.  As to bone and sinew, the men are good as can be;  the impression is, however, that they could not be relied on to stand or to make a charge in their present condition, and that they would do more harm than good if any attempt were made to handle them in the field."</p>
<p>   On the Upper Potomac, where Generals Stone and Banks are in command, there has been some fighting.  In the first engagement the Confederates retreated with the loss of one gun.  On the second occasion 1800 Federals crossed the Potomac at Edward's Ferry, and marched in the direction of Leesburg, near which he was met by a large force of Confederates, who repulsed him.</p>
<p>   In Western Virginia the state of the roads is already such as to forbid the idea of further campaigning for the present.  General Rosencranz, in command of the Federals, had fallen back within six miles of  Gawley Bridge, on the Upper Kanawha.  The enemy, under General Lee, were encamped twenty-six miles to the south-east.  Both armies are in want of the means of transport.</p>
<p>   The opposing armies have not yet come into collision on the soil of Kentucky.  Reinforcements are arriving to both sides.  Ex-Vice-President Breckenridge is rousing the people of Eastern Kentucky to resist the Northern invaders.</p>
<p>   In Western Missouri General Price, with 20,000 troops, has made  a stand near Osceola.  General Fremont was following him.  A body of 5000 Confederates has been defeated at Fredericktown in this State.</p>
<p>   Mr. Cameron, the Secretary of War, has visited Fremont's headquarters to judge for himself how matters were going on.  Before leaving St. Louis he ordered General Fremont to discontinue, as unnecessary, his fieldworks around the city, and that which he was erecting at Jefferson City; to suspend work on the barracks for his bodyguard; to let his debts in St. Louis, amounting to 4,500,000 dollars, remain unpaid until they can be properly examined, and to allow none but the regular disbursing officers to disburse the funds.  General Fremont was informed that the officers appointed by him without the knowledge of the President, numbering over two hundred, would not be paid.  It is supposed, from the tenor of this order, that General Fremont will be removed or compelled to resign.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGNERS.</p>

<p>   The following semi-official announcement has been made from Washington:-"First, no one has been authorised to enlist or raise troops in Canada.  Second, no commissions have been offered nor other overtures made to military men in France or other European States.  Third, the Government has not tendered the command of the army to General Garibaldi.  What is true?  First, that every foreigner  who has come with a good character and credentials and offered his services to the Government in support of the Union has been accepted, and no other is in the military employment of the United States.  Second, General Garibaldi being a naturalised citizen, it was reported to the Government by one of our Consuls that the General was contemplating a visit to this country, and had intimated conditionally  a disposition to engage in the service of the United States.  He was informed, if this were the case, his services would be accepted with pleasure, and he would receive a commission as Brigadier-General, the same rank which was conferred on General Lafayette in the war of the Revolution.  General Garibaldi, upon consideration of the subject, has concluded not to offer his services at present, but thinks he may by-and-by visit the United States."</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S CIRCULAR LETTER.</p>

<p>   The Secretary of State has sent a letter to the Governors of the loyal States calling upon them to adopt measures for defending the coasts.  This letter is conceived in these terms:-</p>
<p rend="right">Department of State, Washington, Oct. 14.</p>
<quote rend="blockquote">Sir,-The present insurrection had not even revealed itself in arms when disloyal citizens hastened to foreign countries to invoke their intervention for the overthrow of the Government and the destruction of the Federal Union.  These agents are known to have made their appeals to some of the more important States without success.  It is not likely, however, that they will remain content with such refusals.  Indeed, it is understood that they are industriously endeavouring to accomplish their disloyal purposes by degrees and by indirection.  Taking advantage of the embarrassments of agriculture, manufacture, and commerce in foreign countries, resulting from the insurrection they have inaugurated at home, they seek to involve our common country in controversies with States with which every public interest and every interest of mankind require that it shall remain in relations of peace, amity, and friendship.  I am able to state for your satisfaction that the prospect of any such disturbance is now less serious than it has been at any previous period during the course of the insurrection.  It is, nevertheless, necessary now, as it has hitherto been, to take every precaution that is possible to avoid the evils of foreign war to be superinduced upon those of civil commotion which we are endeavouring to cure.</p>
<p>   One of the most obvious of such precautions is that our ports and harbours on the seas and lakes should be put in a condition of complete defence, for any nation may be said voluntarily to incur danger in tempestuous seasons when it fails to show that it has sheltered itself on every side from which the storm might possibly come.</p>
<p>   The measures which the Executive can adopt in this emergency are such only as Congress has sanctioned and for which it has provided.</p>
<p>   The President is putting forth the most diligent efforts to execute these measures, and we have the great satisfaction of seeing that these efforts are seconded by the favour, aid, and support of a loyal, patriotic, and self-sacrificing people, who are rapidly bringing the military and naval forces of the United States into the highest state of efficiency.</p>
<p>   But Congress was chiefly absorbed during its recent extra Session with those measures, and did not provide as amply as could be wished for the fortification of our sea and lake coasts.  In previous wars the loyal States have applied themselves by independent and separate activity to the support and aid of the Federal Government in its arduous responsibilities.  The same disposition has been manifested in a degree eminently honourable by all the loyal States during the present insurrection.  In view of this fact, and relying upon the increase and continuance of the same disposition on the part of the loyal States, the President has directed me to invite your consideration to the subject of the improvement and perfection of the defences of the State over which you preside, and to ask you to submit the subject to the consideration of the Legislature when it shall have assembled.  Such proceedings by the State would require only a temporary use of its means.  The expenditures ought to be made the subject of conferences with the Federal Government.  Being thus made with the concurrence of the Government for general defence, there is every reason to believe that Congress would sanction what the State would do, and would provide for its reimbursement.  </p>
<p>   Should these suggestions be accepted, the President will direct the proper agents of the Federal Government to confer with you, and to superintend, direct, and conduct the prosecution of the system of defence of your State.</p>
<p>   I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,    W. H. SEWARD.</p></quote>

<p>American public opinion is at a loss to know what is the immediate cause of this panicstruck epistle.  The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> attributes it to the European intervention in Mexico, which the Federal Government would, in certain eventualities, oppose with all its power.</p>

<p rend="center">LORD LYONS'S PROTEST.</p>

<p>   The British Ambassador has protested against the arbitrary confinement of British subjects, alleging that the authority of Congress was necessary for such measures.</p>
<p>   Mr. Seward replies to the effect that in the present emergency all classes of society alike must cheerfully acquiesce in the measures which the safety of the people demand, and that the British Government would hardly expect the President to accept their explanation of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p>   The New York <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi>, a journal of good authority, avers that the personal relations between Mr. Seward and Lord Lyons are far from friendly.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

 <p>  The telegraph line which is to connect New York and San Francisco has been opened to Utah City in its eastward progress.</p>
<p>   The Commissioners of the World's Fair have <orig reg="organized">organised</orig> themselves by electing Secretary Seward chairman, and Census Commissioner Kennedy secretary.  A committee was appointed to wait on the President, with a request that he would send a national vessel to England to convey such goods as American contributors may desire to exhibit.</p>
<p>The New York banks have offered for the third 50,000,000 dollars of the Federal loan, and for 100,000,000 dollars of Seven per Cent Bonds.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Duke of Argyll was entertained at a grand banquet in Inverary yesterday week by his tenantry.  The banquet was held in the Argyll Arms Hotel-the Rev. Colin Smith, D.D., in the chair.  The formal toasts having been disposed of, the chairman, in an eulogistic speech, proposed the health of their noble guest, which was most enthusiastically responded to.</p>
<p>   The most important statements in the speech of his Grace came in at the close, when, having discoursed on agriculture and the causes of its prosperity, he referred to causes which throw a gloom over manufacturing prospects-the effects of the civil war on the other side of the Atlantic.  On this subject the Duke made these weighty statements:-</p>
<p>   "I see that there has been some fear expressed lately that the inconvenience which is likely to arise in this country from the contest in America is so great that there will be a pressure put upon the Government to interfere in that contest, or at least to take some steps which may ultimately involve us in it.  I have too high an opinion of the good sense and of the public principle of the people of the country to believe that any such pressure will be put upon the Government; and I must add, that I have too great confidence in the firmness and public principle of the Government and Parliament of this country to believe that they will be willing to submit to such pressure if it were put upon them.  It is our absolute duty, I need hardly tell you, to remain entirely neutral in that contest, and not only is it our duty to remain neutral as regards action, but I think it is to a very great extent our duty even to abstain from offering advice, though it might be conceived in a kind and friendly spirit.  No good whatever can arise from offering such advice as that, for example, which was lately offered-I have no doubt with the best intentions-by the Emperor of Russia to the contending parties in America.  The answer which the Americans will infallibly give to any such interference will, however civilly expressed, virtually amount to this-"We are much obliged to you for your kind advice.  We have no doubt that it is conceived in the best spirit and with the best intentions; but there is a general rule in this world that every man should attend to his own affairs.  And there is this additional reason for doing so in the present case, that it is quite evident that you don't understand ours."  That is the answer which, virtually, the Americans have actually given, and which, I am convinced, they will continue to give to all such counsel.  Because, after all, the truth is this, that mere general advice to compose their differences, without any specific suggestion as to the terms upon which those differences are to be adjusted, is always held by the Americans to imply indirectly, even though it be not intended, that the objects for which they are contending are either unworthy or at least trivial and unimportant.</p>
<p>   "Now, whatever we may think of that contest, in fairness to our American friends we ought to admit that no more tremendous issues were ever submitted to the dread arbitrement of war than those which are now submitted to it upon the American continent.  I do not care whether we look at it from the Northern or from the Southern point of view.  Take the mere question of what is called the right of secession.  I know of no Government which has ever existed in the world that could possibly have admitted the right of secession from its own allegiance.  There is a curious animal in Loch Fine which I have sometimes dredged up from the bottom of the sea, and which performs the most extraordinary, innocent, and able acts of suicide and self-destruction.  It is a peculiar kind of starfish, which, when brought up from the bottom of the water, and when any attempt is made to take hold of it, immediately throws off all its arms-its very centre breaks up, and nothing remains of one of the most beautiful forms of nature but a thousand wriggling fragments.  Such, undoubtedly, would have been the fate of the American Union if its Government had admitted what is called the right of secession.  Gentlemen, Ithink we ought to admit, in fairness to the Americans, that there are some things worth fighting for, and that national existence is one of these.  And then, gentlemen, if we go to the South-if we look at the matter from the Southern point of view, difficult as it may be for us to do so-I must say also that I am not surprised at their conduct.  If they believe-as they loudly proclaim they do believe-that slavery is not an evil which is to be tolerated only and brought to an end as soon as possible, but a Divine institution for the benefit of mankind, to be maintained, and, if possible, extended, and which, if it is assailed even in a single outpost, must be defended to the death; then, even though the citadel of slavery be not assailed, but only an important outwork, it is but natural that the South should rise in its defence.  But, of course, in this as in all other revolutions, those who take part in them must be judged finally by the moral verdict of mankind upon the justice of the cause which they have risen to assert.  But, whatever may be our private sympathies, we, as a nation, must take no part whatever in the contest.  Most earnestly do we trust and pray that it may be brought to a speedy end; yet I confess that there is another wish which, I think, in our mind ought to stand even before this one, and that is, the wish that the end of this war, whenever it does come-be it soon or late-may be such as shall be worth the sacrifice and the cost-such as shall tend to the <orig reg="civilization">civilisation</orig> of the world, and promote the cause of human freedom."</p>
<p>   Several other toasts appropriate to the occasion were proposed and responded to in the course of the evening.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 2,1861.</p>

 <p>  The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has relieved the Courts of England, France, and Spain from embarrassment.  They had desired to take certain steps in reference to Mexico, and, indeed, had made all preparations for the expedition, but there was a delay and a hesitation which are now accounted for.  By the last mails came a number of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, in which is contained the gracious permission for which the three Powers had been waiting.  The journal says, "We see no objection to the united action of England, France, and Spain in this matter."  All difficulty is now over; and, Mr. Bennett having graciously permitted Lord Palmerston, the Emperor, and Marshal O'Donnell to act, the expedition sails immediately.  But it is right to add that Spain is cautioned against taking any isolated action of her own, and is informed that if she makes any attempt towards the conquest of Mexico the North will immediately declare war upon her.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Marshal will at once dispach a grandee of the first class to call at the office of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> (north-west corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets, New York-but what need to mention the locale of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> or of the Great Pyramid?) and explain that nothing of the kind will be attempted.  The other news from America is less satisfactory.  There are renewed rumours of engagements, but of their importance or of their issues we have no coherent information.</p>
<p>   With casualties, unless they present some special feature connecting them with larger questions, we do not deal; nor is our recurrence to a recent fearful event in America an exception to our rule.  The hideous story of the burning of several unfortunate young ladies who were engaged in the business of a theatre in Philadelphia is not likely to be forgotten; but it may as well be forgotten unless it produces a result here.  In London alone there are some five-and-twenty places of amusement open every night, and a similar accident might occur at any one of them.  Managers are largely and generously befriended by the press: shortcomings are overlooked, and merits are praised to the very full of their deserts; and the press has ample right of appeal to the directors of our places of entertainment.  We therefore ask, and shall gladly hear, though we hardly expect, replies in the affirmative.  Is there, in any of the London theatres, a provision against fire on the stage? and, if so, is that provision kept in order, and are the servants of the theatre <orig reg="familiarized">familiarised<orig> with it?</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">EAUREGARD</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">ND</hi> M'C<hi rend="smallcaps">LELLAN,</hi>-The following comparison is drawn by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent between the Federal and Confederate Commanders-in-Chief, who were old fellow-students and classmates:-"To my mind there is something of resemblance between the men.  Both are below the middle height.  They are both squarely built, and famed for muscular power since their college days.  Beauregard, indeed, is lean and thin-ribbed; M'Clellan is full and round, with a Napoleonic tendency to <hi rend="italic">embonpoint</hi>, subdued by incessant exercise.  Beauregard sleeps little; M'Clellan's temperament requires a full share of rest; both are spare and Spartan in diet, studious, quiet.  Beauregard is rather saturnine, and, if not melancholic, is of a grim gaiety; M'Clellan is genial, even in his reserve.  The density of the hair, the squareness of the jaw, the firmness and regularity of the teeth, and the outlines of the features are points of similarity in both, which would be more striking if Beauregard were not of the true Louisianian creole tint, while M'Clellan is fair-complexioned.  Beauregard has a dark, dull, student's eye, the dulness of which arises, however, from its formation, for it is full of fire, and its glances are quick and searching.  M'Clellan has a deep, clear eye, into which you can look far and deep, while you feel its searches far and deep into you.  Beauregard has something of pretension in his manner-not hauteur, but a folding-armed, meditative sort of air, which seems to say, "Don't disturb me; I'm thinking of military movements."  M'Clellan seems to be always at leisue; but you feel at the same time you ought not to intrude too much upon him, even when you seek in vain for the grounds of that impression in anything that he is doing or saying.  Beauregard is more subtle, crafty, and astute; M'Clellan is more comprehensive, more learned, more impressionable.  Beauregard is a thorough soldier; M'Clellan may prove he is a great General.  The former only looks to military consequences, and disregards popular manifestations; the latter respects the opinions of the outer world, and sees political as well as military results in what he orders.  They are both the creatures of accident, so far as their present positions are concerned.  It remains to be seen if either can control the current of events, and if in either the artilleryman or the cavalry officer of the old United States' army there is the stuff around which history is moulded, such as that of which the artilleryman of Brienne or the leader of the Ironsides was made."</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MONG</hi> the incidental benefits likely to result from the civil war in America, as some compensation for the incalculable evils it inflicts, we are not without hope that a revision of belligerent rights will be one.  Much of what the world now accepts as international law with regard to them is unsuited to modern <orig reg="civilization">civilisation</orig>.  Take the right of blockade, for instance, as it is being illustrated in the unhappy contest between the Northern and Southern States of the great American Republic.  The right is held, and no doubt justly held, to be in perfect conformity with the law of nations.  But the instincts of mankind will infallibly teach them that the instrument of coercion which cannot be applied to crush the rebellious without at the same time exposing to equal damage the rights and interests of millions innocent of the smallest wrong ought not to be left in the hands of any Power.  It is hard that because the Confederate States have renounced their allegiance to the Union, and are strong enough to maintain their separate independence for months, and perhaps for years, large departments of manufacturing industry in England and France, upon which the subsistence of millions depend, should be visited with a calamity little short of destruction.  The mischief done by privateering, which the great Powers of Europe have agreed to abolish, is as nothing compared with the wholesale suffering which the blockade now being enforced by the Federal Government is causing to nations not in the least implicated in the pending quarrel.  We do not dispute the fact that the Federal Government is only availing itself of what all other Governments have insisted upon as a belligerent right.  We should be the last to suggest that we should be justified, in the present instance, in breaking the blockade merely because we happen to be the chief victim of its enforcement.  We must make up our minds to bear with patience and dignity the evils which a bad law we have been foremost in sustaining has unexpectedly brought upon ourselves.  But we do trust that the severe hardship which has overtaken us will open our eyes to the essential injustice of this belligerent right, and dispose us to take such steps as will preclude the chance of any similar visitation in future.</p>
<p>   It is too true, we fear, that we owe our present helpless position in regard to the blockade mainly, if not exclusively, to the policy of our own statesmen.  When the Government of the United States was invited, at the close of the Russian War, to agree to the article of  the Treaty of Paris which abolishes privateering, the Secretary of State, in declining that proposition on the ground of the obvious disadvantage at which it would place the American Government in relation to other maritime Powers, submitted a counter proposal, unless our memory greatly deceives us, which would have placed the entire commercial marine of all countries beyond the range of international hostilities.  If that project had found favour with the Governments of Europe the right of blockade  would have been applicable only against vessels of war, and goods contraband of war;  and the only obstruction to the usual flow of cotton to this country would have existed in the determination of the Southern States not to sell it-a determination which high prices and the prospect of raising up rival producers in other parts of the world  very surely and very speedily have overborne.  England alone, we believe, opposed to this reasonable and liberal proposition insuperable objections, and England is now fated to endure the heaviest penalty in consequence of the short-sightedness of her international policy.  In our too great anxiety to retain a weapon of offence which we could wield with better effect than any other Power we unconsciously hung up a scourge for our own backs, and we are now smarting under its infliction.</p>
<p>The unfortunate decision at which we then arrived was owing, probably, to our having limited our view of the evils of war to the injuries which belligerents are capable of doing to each other.  It was thought at the time, and powerfully argued, that Great Britain, the most formidable of the maritime Powers, would gratuitously fling away her sharpest weapon by acceding to Mr. Marcy's proposition; that, being at the expense of keeping afloat a great naval armament, it would prove comparatively useless, in case of hostilities, unless she could avail herself of it<pb n="464"> to strike a blow at the commerce of her enemy; and that the mere fact of her retaining the right and the power of devastating the commercial marine of any country with which she might chance to be at war would tend to the preservation of peace by compelling other nations to be cautious of embroiling themselves with her.  It was not foreseen, or not sufficiently considered, how this determination would bear upon neutrals.  It seems not to have entered into the mind of any one that, without being ourselves at war with the United States, our own excessive jealousy in upholding our naval supremacy might involve us in miseries almost as intolerable as those of actual warfare.  We were unwilling to see the commercial navy of any contingent foe withdrawn by previous arrangement from the reach of that arm in the strength of which we place our chief reliance; and, in refusing to forego our advantage in this respect, we retained, of course, the right of blockade.  But it is as a neutral, not a belligerent, Power that the evil consequences of our own decision have come home to us.  We have sided with neither of the contending parties in America-we have carefully abstained from giving just cause of offence to either of them; but we owe it to our own deliberate decision that, in their quarrel the one with the other, our cotton interests are being crushed as between the upper and the nether millstones.</p>
<p>Such being the circumstances, there would seem to be no alternative in the present case but to bear as best we may the calamity we have indirectly brought upon ourselves.  We must manfully abide by the results of the exercise by others of the belligerent rights we have insisted upon for ourselves.  We hope that her Majesty's Government will loyally and to the end preserve the neutrality they have proclaimed; and that no temptation offered to them by the Confederate States, and no inconvenience entailed upon them by the action of the Federal Union, will prevail upon them to break the blockade, either alone or in concert with other European Powers.  The present distress may be great, but we had far better endure it patiently than expose ourselves to the charge of a breach of international morality.  Any departure from our present neutral position would be but purchasing immediate relief at the expense of future and much greater suffering.  We cannot take direct steps towards putting an end to the existing crisis without sowing the seeds of  enmities the bitter fruit of which we should be compelled to reap at no very remote hereafter.  We might, it is true, by recognising the South, put a speedy end to the present unnatural contest, and liberate the stores of cotton for which our manufactures are pining.  But our intervention to close the dispute whilst the passions of the disputants are yet hot and eager would but precipitate a war of one or both of them with ourselves.  The vast army now resting on the Potomac would probably seek employment in Canada, and the Federal States bereft of the territory which they held south of Washington, and that, too, partly by our agency, would infallibly turn to the North for compensation.  No, we must not interfere.  Cotton is precious, but the price paid for it may be too high.  Tha alternative of neutrality is contingently such as may well</p>

<p rend="center">Make us rather bear the ills we have,</p>
<p rend="center">Than fly to others that we know not of.</p>

<p>England now resembles a man who, having entered into an engagement and refused when opportunity offered to reconsider it, unexpectedly finds that it has an aspect of extreme inconvenience towards himself.  She is utterly precluded by all the obligations of national honour from seeking relief by practically dishonouring her own bond.  Her true policy lies in another direction.  She cannot get cotton from America without breaking open the doors which, as the law of nations now stands, are rightfully barred against her.  She must reject every temptation to commit an international burglary, and resolutely look elsewhere for what she wants.  No doubt she will feel the pinch; but, having made up her mind to brave it, she will be the better prepared to use every legitimate appliance which will mitigate her sufferings.  She is not destined, under any conceivable circumstances, to face the entire destruction of her cotton manufacture.  The very extremity of distress to which she seems to be exposed will attract to her markets all the disposable cotton which tropical climates can forward to her.  The strain which is put upon her will bear down most of the obstacles which have hitherto indisposed her to seek her supplies elsewhere.  Even from America some part of the crop which is locked up by the civil war may find its way hither whenever the Confederate States shall have arrived at the conviction that we have no intention of breaking the blockade, and that they are in danger of losing the monopoly of our markets.  The hope of <orig reg="realizing">realising</orig> high prices on the one hand and the fear of being permanently supplanted by India on the other will operate powerfully towards their discovery of some method by which to convey their produce to Europe.  The slave trade has never yet been put down on the western coast of Africa by blockading squadrons, and the cotton trade, no doubt, will be equally fertile in expedients and equally successful in partially evading or surmounting the difficulties by which it is beset.  The greater our efforts to render ourselves independent of the Confederate States for our supplies of cotton the more desperate will be their attempts to reach our markets.  Indeed, it is becoming a fair question whether even our immediate as well as our remoter interests may not be best subserved by our loyal and steadfast observance of belligerent rights.</p>
<p>The events of the last few months, however, have surely sufficed to demonstrate that the law of nations embodying these belligerent rights is altogether out of tune with the spirit and wants of modern <orig reg="civilization">civilisation</orig>.  We trust the lesson which has been taught us will not have been thrown away.  War is now carried on under far different conditions than those which prevailed in olden times.  Armies are not now allowed to devastate private property in the countries in which they are engaged, nor is there any sound reason why navies should be permitted to do so at sea.  The interests of humanity equally demand the exemption of commerce from warlike liabilities.  But justice also demands it; for no one can pretend that the state of things which may involve the most vital interests of neutrals in every international dispute that may trouble the repose of the world is conformable with the first and most obvious principles of justice.  England has but to accept a more liberal doctrine to obtain for it universal recognition.  She is the first commercial nation in the world, and it would be as much to her interest as it would redound to her honour to place commerce beyond the lawful reach of international hostilities.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the steamer North American we have advices to the evening of the 26th ult.  The most important event of the week has been the completion of the great continental telegraph line, uniting San Francisco with New York, and so with Cape Race, Newfoundland-a connected line of 6000 miles, and the longest in the world.  It was finished on the 25th ult., and a message exchanged between the Mayors of  San Francisco and New York.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>A battle has been fought on the Upper Potomac to the advantage of the Confederates.  On the 21st ult. the Federals, to the number of 1736, advanced upon Leesburg.  The Federals were commanded by General Stone and the Confederates by General Evans.  The former was eventually compelled to abandon the field and fall back across the Potomac with the loss of 600 men, including General Baker, killed.  Of these 400 are set down as "missing."  The retreating forces reached the river-bank about twenty minutes before nightfall.  As there were no means of conveyance across the river, those who could swim plunged into the river, some carrying their arms and others throwing them away.  Many were drowned.  The Federals were subsequently reinforced, and returned to the charge; but, on the approach of two strong columns of Confederates, again retreated into Maryland.  General Baker was Senator for Oregon, and an Englishman by birth.  He emigrated, when young, to Illinois and thence to California.  He was, we believe, the only Englishman who ever sat in the United States' Senate.</p>
<p>The Confederates have obtained the command of the Potomac from Quantico Creek to Chopowamsic Creek.  A crowd of small vessels employed in the commissary service of the Washingtonians are detained below the batteries, and fears are entertained that the supplies of forage for the 30,000 horses and mules in and around the capital will run short unless the batteries are silenced.</p>
<p>In Kentucky General Zellicoffer at the head of a body of the Confederates attacked General Gerard.  He was repulsed three times.  This skirmish is the first which has taken place on the soil of this State.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia the campaign is over for the season.  The Northerners hold the ground from Gauley River on the south, to Cheat Mountain on the east.  The Federals were suffering much from sickness in this now inclement region.</p>
<p>In Missouri, Lexington has been retaken by the Federals.  150 troops under General White surprised the garrison, numbering 300.  Only two pieces of cannon were found in the fort.  General Fremont is still said to be in pursuit of General Price.  General Fremont has not been removed from his command only because the influence of his name with the Western people is so great that the Cabinet fears lest his removal would damp the popular ardour for the war there and put a stop to recruiting.</p>
<p>The accounts of the Confederate attack on the Federals on Santa Rosa Island and on the blockading fleet off New Orleans were much exaggerated, especially the latter.  No vessel was destroyed or even damaged, and no man killed.  Some timber was destroyed and a transport laden with coal taken.</p>
<p>The great naval expedition, composed of 80 vessels, carrying 500 guns and between 30,000 and 40,000 men, would sail from Hampton, near Fortress Monroe, on the 27th ult., for some undisclosed point on the Southern coast.</p>
<p>The Southern Commissioners to England and France who ran the blockade at Charleston have arrived at Cardenas, in Cuba.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARREST OF BRITISH SUBJECTS.</p>

<p>In an important correspondence between Lord Lyons and Mr. Seward relative to the arrest, by order of the latter, of two British subjects, and the refusal on the part of the military authorities to recognise the writ of habeas corpus, Lord Lyons, in the name of the English Government, vehemently complains of this proceeding as being at variance with the ties of amity between the two countries and a violation of the American Constitution.  Mr. Seward, in a lengthy reply, describes the circumstances under which the two British subjects in question were arrested, with a view to show that the Government were justified in regarding them as objects of suspicion, and that when their innocence was made apparent they were at once liberated.  Mr. Seward then defends the adoption of extreme measures on the ground of the exigencies of the country in a time of civil war, when battling for its existence, and with some sarcasm remarks that "the British Government will hardly expect that the President will accept their explanation of the Constitution of the United States."  Mr. Seward, at the same time, argues that the President has in no respect transcended his powers.</p>
<p>The Northern press, without exception, sustain Mr. Seward; but the<hi rend="italic"> New York Tribune</hi> hopes that these extraordinary powers will be used as seldom as possible, and that the offender will in loyal districts be speedily brought to trial.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward's previous circular to the Governors calling on them to fortify their coasts is condemned by the moderate portion of the press as uncalled for.  It caused a panic in the New York money market; Federal Six per Cents fell three per cent, and the popular subscriptions to the national loan dwindled to one half the previous amount.  The stocks have since recovered themselves, but the subscriptions to the loan continue to feel the effect of the panic.</p>
<p>Arms and munitions of the war are arriving in New York from England and the Continent.  They are chiefly destined for the army of the west.  The Quartermaster-General having sent an agent to England to purchase &pound:1,000,000 worth of clothing for the army, the New England manufacturers protested and declared that all purchases should be made at home.  The Quartermaster-General replied that his wants were urgent, and human life depended on an immediate supply, which could not be had at home, but that as little money should be disbursed abroad as possible.</p>
<p>The slave-traders have left the port of New York, where they find themselves watched too narrowly.  Nine persons indicted for participating in this traffic are now in gaol in New York awaiting their trial.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin and niece have visited Nevada Territory, where they were received with honour by the Legislature then in session there.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi>  9, 1861.
<p>Mexico now has full notice of what is in store for her.</p>

<p rend="center">They are coming, and they are three.</p>

<p>The terms of the convention under which England, France, and Spain intend to act are before the public, and nothing can be more just or fair.  The Powers enter upon the scene less as soldiers than as policemen.  It is specially agreed that no Power is to acquire any territory.  The important places are to be occupied, and then the Mexicans themselves will be rather stringently invited to set their house in order.  It has also been provided, in order that the "United" States may have no pretext for complaint, that President Lincoln may send in aid of the expedition any number of ships which he can spare from his operations against the South.  It is to be hoped that the ruffians who, under the priests, at present exercise unrestrained sway in the unfortunate country in question will not avail themselves of the interval between the announcement and the arrival of the expedition to commit new atrocities.  If they should do so, the duties of the policeman will have to be temporarily exchanged for those of the Provost Marshal and it is possible that the Mexican brigands may have a distinct idea that such will be the case.  Lieutenant-Colonel Lowder commands our force, and the officers have received orders to proceed to Plymouth for embarkation.</p>
<p>The American question is treated elsewhere.  Here it may be sufficient to note, as part of the record of the war, that the Federals have suffered another and a severe repulse on the Potomac, losing a General and 600 men.  Smaller affairs are reported, in which the Federals state themselves to have had the advantage, but the Southern journals deny this.  But a grand naval blow is now to be struck; and at the last mails a fleet of eighty vessels, with from 30,000 to 40,000 men on board, was to sail the next day, probably to attack New Orleans.  We have no information that justifies our believing that the South has adequate means of resisting such an onslaught; but the Confederates speak undauntedly, and declare that, be the victory as complete as it may, it shall be a barren one.  The army, under General M'Lellan, was daily expected to advance upon the enemy.</p>

<p rend="center">GUARD TENT: PUNISHMENT DRILL IN THE FEDERAL CAMP.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> modes of punishment adopted in the Federal army may be thought, perhaps, to smack of undue barbarity, although the Americans have been prone to taunt the English and other European Powers with the brutalities practised on their soldiers.  Judging by what has been said and written on this subject by Americans, it would seem that a free and enlightened people like our Transatlantic cousins, even when serving in the ranks, could not be treated as the hirelings of a despotic Government.  Yet, glancing at the Illustration on page 467 (from a Sketch by our Special Artist), it would require some hardihood to affirm that the English soldier is treated with greater indignity or cruelty than the American citizen.  On the left is an unfortunate Unionist with a cannon-ball chained to his ankle, and carrying on his shoulder a heavy log of wood.  Another delinquent is made to stand erect on a small barrel for hours together; while below him is a wretched wight trussed like a fowl for the spit.  In the background a poor fellow is corded, with his hands high above his head, to a tree-the rope which supports him eating into his wrists and stopping the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p rend="center">CUTTING OFF A CONFEDERATE DESPATCH-GALLEY ON THE POTOMAC.</p>

<p>The Confederates of Maryland keep up a constant communication with the Secession forces on the Virginian shore of the Potomac, and most hazardous are the means frequently employed to convey information of the Federal movements to the enemy.  At times a swift-going galley, manned by four oarsmen and a coxswain, will suddenly dash out from a creek at night and make rapidly for the Virginian side, trusting to escape the notice of the blockading flotilla in the confusion if speaking the numerous supply-boats carrying stores to Washington from Chesapeake Bay.  Sometimes these boats, it is likely enough, are successful in their attempts; but they are frequently detected, as in the instance illustrated by our Special Artist on page 470, and then ensues an exciting chase.  The gun-boat has lowered one of her gigs to go in pursuit, while she fires a shot from her bow-gun at the traitor galley.  There is full another mile to row to the shore, the man-of-war gig is coming up fast, and one more shot will shiver the "Secesh" to atoms.  So the crew give in, and the papers destined for Davis or Beauregard are sent up the next day to the State department at Washington, while the blockade-breakers are provided with quarters in Fortress Monroe.</p>
<p>Since receiving this Illustration from our Special Artist the command of the Potomac by the Federal forces has been somewhat checked.  Thus we read that on the 19th ult., as the Federal tug-boat the Resolute was towing up the Potomac a supply-vessel, the Confederate batteries opened upon them, and the latter, having got adrift, was boarded.  On the same day the flag ship Union went down the river from Washington, destined for Fortress Monroe.  To the mortification of the National authorities, she was compelled to return, having found it impossible to get past the formidable batteries which the Confederates had opened.  The officers of these vessels, moreover, announce that the guns were splendidly aimed, and that the Confederates are able, at the various points they command, to throw large-sized rifle shell clean over into the Maryland side.  On the 22nd Commander Craven, of the Potomac squadron, informed the Navy Department that the Confederate batteries were impassable, a formidable battery at Matthias Point having been unmasked. </p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICAN</hi> N<hi rend="smallcaps">ATIONAL</hi> H<hi rend="smallcaps">YMN</hi>.-It will be remembered, perhaps, that some Americans, sick of "Yankee Doodle," "Hail, Columbia!" and "The Star-spangled Banner," offered a prize of 500 dollars for a new national hymn.  Twelve hundred "copies of verses" were forwarded to the committee appointed for selection and judgment, who, being men of some sense and taste, came to the decision-which might have been anticipated-that not one out of the twelve hundred was worthy the prize of &pound:100.  The labour of the committee, however, did not end here.  They resolved to make a dollar volume out of the rejected hymns, and committed its arrangement to Mr. Richard Grant White, whose name is known on this side of the Atlantic as a painstaking editor and commentator on Shakespeare.  This book of hymns has just been published in New York, printed on tinted paper, with an essay by Mr. White on "National Hymns; how they are written, and how they are not written," illustrated by the words and music of the most popular patriotic European hymns.  Then follows a selection of the best and the worst of the rejected twelve hundred.  The worst, of course, are expected to be the most entertaining, as Mr. White prints them <hi rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</hi>, in all their grammatical and rhetorical effulgency.-<hi rend="Italic">Critic</hi>.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the Cunard steamer Arabia we have Boston journals to the 30th ult. and a telegram vi$acirc: Halifax to the 31st.  Owing to the stormy weather on the Atlantic, the weekly steamer of the Canadian line has not yet arrived.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The great naval expedition sailed from Hampton Roads on the 29th ult.  The naval armament is under the command of Captain Dupont, and the troops under that of Brigadier-General Sherman, an old and experienced officer.  The troops number about 20,000 men, mostly from New England and New York.  All the mat&eacute:rial of the expedition is of corresponding magnitude.  There are boats enough to land a division at a time.  There are army-<orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> and horses in abundance.  Carpenters, masons, and labourers, with stone and other building materials, accompany the troops.  It is the largest and best appointed naval force which ever left a United States' port.  Secretary Cameron instructs the commanders to hold strictly to the Conservative course hitherto pursued by the Federal Government towards the slaves in the vicinage of the place where the expedition will land.</p>
<p>With reference to the Federal defeat near Leesburg, now definitively called the battle of Ball's Bluff, we learnt nothing by the telegraph, as the Federal commanders showed no desire to publish their disasters to the world.  Private letters to the newspapers revealed the truth.  In one regiment there were only two swords and no firelocks left; all the others were lost, captured, or thrown away.  The scramble to the river is described as frightful-another Beresina-masses of drowning men.  If the Confederates had been provided with artillery there would have been a pitiable massacre.  The report of Colonel Hinks, of the Massachusetts 19th Regiment, sets down the loss at 900 out of 2100 engaged.  Of these 500 are reckoned as prisoners.  He also reports that a New York City regiment (the "Tammany") deserted its post in the intrenchments on an island in the Potomac and crossed over to the Maryland shore in disobedience of orders.  He says the means of transportation were "criminally deficient" and the landing-place most unfortunately selected, while within half a mile on either side there were convenient spots for the purpose.</p>
<p>The grand army of the Potomac is doing nothing more heroic than devastating the small portion of the Valley of Virginia which they hold.  In Western Virginia the Confederates have been surprised in and dislodged from Romney.  In Kentucky the skirmishes have resulted in favour of the Federalists, who hold two-thirds of the State.</p>
<p>In Missouri General Fremont has been at length superseded by the President.  General Hunter succeeds him in the command of the army of the West.  General Henderson has capitulated with 400 Confederates.  Many persons think that the removal of Fremont will have an injurious effect on recruiting in the Western States.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Judge Merrick has been put under arrest for issuing writs of habeas corpus in behalf of minors who have enlisted without their parents' consent, and for issuing warrants against the military authorities who disobeyed the writ.  The President subsequently intimated to the court that he had suspended the privilege of the writ in regard to the army, and the dispute ends with the victory of the military over the civil authorities.</p>
<p>General Baker's remains were honoured with public obsequies, which, however, spectators assert, were very negligently conducted.  The President was much affected by the event.  He paced up and down his room all night.  Mrs. Lincoln received no visitors.  Lord Lyons would have attended the funeral, but the invitation did not reach him in time.</p>

<p rend="center">WESTERN VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>The people of this region have ratified the action of their Legislature, and voted in favour of separation from the rest of the State by large majorities in both city and country.  A convention is to assemble on the 26th inst., to frame a Constitution for the new State, named Kanawha, from the river of that name which traverses it.  Thirty-nine counties participated in this vote.</p>

<p rend="center">GARIBALDI'S SYMPATHIES.</p>

<p>The following, addressed to the United States' Consul at Antwerp, has been published as genuine:- </p>

<p rend="right">Caprera, Sept. 10, 1861.</p>
<quote rend="quoteblock">MY  dear Sir,-I saw Mr. Sandford, and regret to be obliged to announce to you that I shall not be able to go to the United States at present.  I do not doubt of the triumph of the Union, and that shortly.  But if the war should unfortunately continue in your beautiful country, I shall overcome all obstacles which detain me and hasten to the defence of a people who are dear to me.              G. GARIBALDI</quote>
<p>To Mr. Quiggle, United States' Consul at Antwerp.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Memminger, the Secretary of the Treasury, has issued a circular, dated Richmond, Oct. 17, relative to the produce loan and the application of the cotton-planters for relief.  Mr. Memminger, in the name of the Cabinet, declines to grant any relief, either by the purchase of the cotton crop or an advance upon its hypothecated value.  He advises the planters to apply to the bankers for relief, and to "take measures for winter crops to relieve the demand for grain and provisions.  Let them proceed to divert part of their labour from cotton, and make their own clothing and supplies."</p>
<p>At the commercial convention held in Macon, Georgia, some resolutions conceived in a spirit hostile to the future resumption of commercial relations with the North were voted down on the motion of General Duff Green, who declared that the adoption of these resolutions would make any adjustment with the North impossible, and prevent any reconstruction of the commercial and financial relations between the North and the South.  This is interpreted at the North as a sign that the Southerners are not bent on resisting to the extremity.</p>
<p>Some citizens of Hyde County, North Carolina-a county in which Hatteras Inlet is included-have met together, under the protection of the Federal forces, and affirmed their unshaken loyalty to the Union and their non-allegiance to the Confederate Government.</p>
<p>M. Antonio Costa, of New Orleans, has reopened connection by mail between the Southern States and Europe, which has been closed since August.  The mail is a monthly one, and goes by way of Mexico and the English steamers to the West Indies.  The first post contained 1233 letters.  The tariff of charges is-to Mexico, 50 cents; to Cuba, 75 cents; to Europe, 1 dollar.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The vote at the late State election for the two "war" candidates for Governor was 86,300; for the peace candidate less than 33,000.</p>
<p>The first telegram sent from the Pacific to the Atlantic was sent by Chief Justice Field, of California, to the President.  It was as follows:-</p>

<p rend="right">Sacramento, Oct. 24. </p>
<quote rend="quoteblock">In the tempoaray absence of the Governor of the State, I am requested to send you the first message which will be transmitted over the wires of the telegraph line which connect the Pacific with the Atlantic States.  The people of California desire to congratulate you upon the completion of the great work.  They believe that it will be the means of strengthening the attachment which binds both the East and the West to the Union; and they desire in this the first message across the Continent to express their loyalty to that Union and their determination to stand by the Government in this its day of trial.  They regard that Government with affection, and will adhere to it under all fortunes.</quote>

<p>The European news which starts from Newfoundland at, say,4 p.m. would reach San Francisco at 11.30 a.m., or four hours and a half ahead of time.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PRIVATEERSMEN ON TRIAL.</p>

<p>The case of the captain of the privateer Savannah at New York, after a trial of three days' duration, ended in the discharge of the jury, they being unable to agree on a verdict.  In Philadelphia a jury have found a privateersman "Guilty."  The Judge has not yet pronounced sentence.</p>

<p>In the State of Kentucky at the present time it is estimated there are nearly 2,700,090 hogs and in Missouri nearly 2,000,000.  In the whole of the United States about 30,000,000 hogs are raised annually, of which more than one-half are raised in the Southern States.  During the week ending the 19th ult. 1,377,546 bushels of grain and 83,524 barrels of flour were exported from New York to Europe.  The value of these exports was about &pound:455,000.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> a recent Number we gave an Illustration and some account of the American Pony Express, the means by which rapid communication is maintained between the far-divided territories of the United States situated on each side of the Rocky Mountains.  We this week give a View of the town of St. Joseph, the eastern terminus of the various overland expresses, and one of the principal points of arrival and departure of the great overland traffic to and from the eastern and western territories.</p>
<p>The Sketch from which our Illustration is engraved is taken from the landing-place on the Kansas shore, near the town of Pembroke, where a steam-ferry exists, by which means the coaches, <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, &c., are carried across the turbid waters of the Missouri.</p>
<p>St. Joseph, always irreverently called St. Joe in the States, is a quaint and curious town, though so new, yet full of interest; like all newly-born American cities, it has commenced its growth in a number of different places at the same time.  The land, being laid out in square blocks and lots, is purchased sometimes by people who speculate in a rise in the price and do not intend to build; consequently those who do often find themselves without neighbours for some years after they have erected their houses, and a great street that is to be, may for some time have only one house in it.  "Town lots" are "<orig reg="favorite">favourite</orig> items" with the speculators, and no end of money has been made by the judicious and farseeing, and large sums have been as frequently lost by the over-sanguine and incautious.</p>
<p>St. Joe can boast of some good shops round about the market-place, and the houses in that locality lie pretty thick.  The principal buildings are, as usual in American towns, the hotels, and although St. Joe is a far-off, outlying place, with many a long stretch of prairie between it and the populous cities of the Union, yet the "Patee House" affords as comfortable accommodation and entertainment as many of the great hotels in the large cities.</p>
<p>St. Joe has of late been brought much before the public in England in the constantly-arriving reports from America; it is now threatened by the Confederate forces, and we may here any day of the place being taken by a <hi rend="italic">coup de main</hi>.  It was in the immediate neighbourhood of this city that the great wooden bridge was partly destroyed by the enemy, so that on the arrival of the train the whole was precipitated into a deep ravine, and a number of persons killed and wounded.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature about St. Joe arises from the fact of its being the principal point of departure and arrival for the trains of <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> going or returning from the overland passage to California or Oregon.  In our account of the pony express we mentioned the firm of Russell, Major, and Co., as being the proprietors of it; that is, however, but a small part of their business, for they are the most extensive carriers of goods and passengers in the Union, excepting, of course, the railway companies.  They started last year from St. Joe, Leavenworth, and Nebraska city, two hundred and eighteen trains<pb n="492"> of <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, each train consisting of twenty-six <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, making in all five thousand six hundred and sixty-eight <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, each drawn by twelve bullocks, consequently requiring in all between sixty and seventy thousand bullocks, besides relays and substitutes for those which break down.  This firm execute large transportation contracts for the United States' Government; their business with them in 1858 amounted to five million dollars.  They employ in all about five thousand men.</p>
<p>Near the foot of the Rocky Mountains is a place called Denver City.  Large deposits of gold and silver exist in its neighbourhood, and, as several thousand persons live there who produce nothing but the precious metals, the whole of the supplies have to be carried in these <orig reg="wagon">waggon</orig>-trains.  This is a large portion of the business during the summer, as they are entirely shut off from all supplies during the winter.  The United States' mail is carried twice a month from St. Joe to Salt Lake City, the abode of the Mormons, and on to Placerville, California.</p>
<p>For mutual protection the <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> travel in trains across the plains, from sixteen to twenty-six making up a train.  Each large <orig reg="wagon">waggon</orig> carries about 6000lb.: they are drawn by oxen or horses; they start early in the morning, and travel until midday; the cattle then graze on the plains in charge of a herdsman, while the voyageurs hunt and shoot, plenty of game being found on the prairies, as well as buffaloes, deer, elks, and antelopes.  At night the <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig> are placed together so as to form a square or a triangle, the cattle being placed within the inclosure, the camp fires are lighted, and the men sleep on the ground wrapped in their blankets.  Great caution is necessary when travelling on the plains, as tribes of wild Indians traverse them, who steal and kill when they dare; they are, however, afraid of white men and the terrible weapons they carry, and will only attack when immeasurably superior in numbers.  There are Comanchees, Pawnees, Crows, Blackfeet, Assinitoines, Sioux, and others; occasionally they fight great battles with each other.  At one place on the route of the trains is a spot called the Battle Ground: it consists of about six acres of land, filled with holes about 2ft. square and 4ft. deep.  In these holes a whole tribe of Indians hid themselves so that, when their opponents camped in the neighbourhood, they were unobserved, and, choosing a fitting time, they rushed down upon the unsuspecting enemy, and slaughtered and scalped the greater part of them.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 16, 1861.</p>
<p>At length the Southern States have sent us two gentlemen authorised to state to England the position and resolution of the Confederates.  The Hon. Messrs. Mann and Yancey were entertained by the Fishmongers on the night of the Lord Mayor's banquet, at which latter Mr. Adams, the American Minister, made a highly-complimentary speech, claiming for the North the same ancestry, traditions, and laws as those of England, but never alluding to the fact that ten millions of his countrymen were in arms against the North.  Mr. Adams was delivering himself thus at one end of a street at the other end of which Mr. Yancey was thanking us for having recognised the South as "belligerents," and was declaring that there could be no peace until they ceased to be treated as rebels.  He spoke out boldly, asserted the certainty of Southern independence, but added that there were few sacrifices it would not make consistently with the claims of liberty and honour.  Perhaps the impression is deepening that as soon as the North shall have gained some brilliant military or naval victory, and thus atoned for the long series of disasters which have marked its campaigns, both parties will not be disinclined to listen to the mediating voices of France and England.  If this should not be the case, and the ruin and wretchedness of millions in the Old World should appear the inevitable consequence of a continuance of the blockade, it is not impossible that the statesmen of both these countries may have to consider how far the rule <hi rend="italic">salus populi suprema lex</hi> can be harmonised with a too rigid interpretation of the law of nations.  But we trust they may be spared any such necessity.  We now await with interest the news from the great fleet which the North has sent forth.</p>

<p>The annual ceremony of the Lord Mayor's Day was attended on Saturday with all the paraphernalia that have come through time-hallowed customs to be associated with that event.  . . .</p>
<p>In the evening a more than usually influential company assembled to dine at the Guildhall.  Among the speakers after dinner were the Duke of Cambridge, Lord Palmerston, and Mr. Adams, the United States' Minister. . . . Lord Palmerston congratulated the country on the satisfactory state of the revenue, and spoke of the present dearth of cotton as a temporary evil which would, no doubt, be productive of  permanent good.  "We shall find," he said, "in various quarters of the globe a sure, a certain, and an ample supply, which will prevent us being dependent on one source of production." . . . His Lordship touched but slightly on the American war.  He "viewed the conflict with an affliction which no words could express; but it was not for us to pass judgment upon the dispute."  The Lord Mayor offered to Mr. Adams "the entire sympathy of the whole British people."  His Excellency, in returning thanks, said he was there to perpetuate the friendly relations between England and the United States.  He dwelt chiefly on the honour which is paid in America to those who have distinguished themselves in the mother country, and made the troubles which distract his country conspicuous by the absence of any reference thereto in his address. . . .</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Adams was being f&ecirc:ted at the Mansion House, Mr. Dudley Mann and Mr. Yancey, the Plenipotentiaries of the Confederate States, were dining and making speeches at the hall of the Fishmongers' Company.  The Prime Warden expressed an earnest hope that the strife which is now raging in North America might speedily give way to peace.  Mr. Yancey echoed this sentiment, but said there was no prospect of such a result so long as the Federal Government treated the people of the South as rebels.  If the North would recognise them as belligerents, then the Confederate Government would be "inflexible on one point only-its honour and independence.  For the great interests of peace and humanity it would yield much that is merely material or of secondary importance.  The Southerners," he continued, "are fighting for the right to govern themselves, and for the purpose of resisting subjugation; and, though they are cut off from foreign trade, they are still in a position to equip and maintain in the field an army of 250,000 men.  They have not sought, and they do not desire, foreign intervention; for they are united, and can fight their own battles.  They are anxious to be recognised by the various Powers, but they have no reason to complain, nor do they feel aggrieved, because these great Powers see fit for a season to defer their formal recognition and reception into the family of nations."  The report states that Mr. Yancey resumed his seat amid loud and continued cheering.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">RIGHAM</hi> Y<hi rend="smallcaps">OUNG</hi>, the President and Chief Prophet of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, or Mormons, was born about the year 1800.  Very little is known of his early life.  It is generally supposed that he is a native of the State of Ohio; and it is said that he has brothers engaged in the ministry in the Methodist Church.  In connection with the Mormons he first appeared in a prominent position in August, 1844, soon after the murder of Joseph Smith, the founder of the sect.  Young was then President of the Twelve Apostles, and in that capacity signed a letter addressed "To the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo (Illinois) and all the World."  One of the principal men in the community, Sydney Rigdon, sought to succeed Smith; but charges of heresy and improper conduct were urged against him by Young and others; he was excommunicated, and Young was appointed the successor of Smith.  By his shrewdness and great natural ability he has shown the wisdom of the choice.  Perceiving that the Illinoisians were hostile to his people, he planned and carried out an exodus unparalleled in history for the sufferings of the people who accomplished it.  They resolved to place the Rocky Mountains between them and persecuting Christendom.  Cold and hunger killed many on the road; but, after a year and a half of inconceivable hardships, the pioneers reached the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, in July, 1847, and founded a settlement.  The mass of the people followed in the next year, and in the thirteen years which have succeeded, under the guidance and government of Brigham Young, they have converted a bare valley into a lovely region of cultivated fields, rich orchards, flower-filled gardens, and pleasant residences.  They have brought the water from the hills in sparkling rivulets through every street.  They have erected mills for grinding the grain of their own growth, and sawing the wood that their own sturdy arms have felled.  They manufacture their own paper, and spin and weave their own fabrics; and when articles are wanted from the outer world they are carried across the great desert in <orig reg="wagons">waggons</orig>, sometimes numbering over fifty in a single train.  In all these works "the President," as the people call him, or "Brother Brigham," as he styles himself, has been the directing and influencing power.  He has forbidden the establishment of beershops, and there is only one place in Salt Lake City where liquor in quantities can be obtained.  Soon after sunset the streets are as quiet as Goldsmith's Deserted Village, for the citizens remain in their homes, except when in the winter they attend the balls or theatrical entertainments, which are frequent, or exercise their voices in their musical parties.  A traveller ignorant of their practice of polygamy would say from the appearance of things that a more industrious and better-conducted community is not to be found.  They consider polygamy, to the extent of having five wives at least, an essential of respectability; but the practice is by no means universal.  Young is President by semi-annual election, or rather by a unanimous viv&acirc: voce confirmation by the people assembled in the Bowery.  He rules, as head of the Church and <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Governor of the territory of Utah, over a region containing more than 180,000 square miles prior to the formation by the last Congress of the new territories, which have slightly infringed upon his domain.  This is an extent of country exceeding the size of Great Britain and Ireland by over 70,000 square miles.  Young is a portly man of middle height, now in his sixty-second year, and apparently so healthy that he may live for some years yet to direct the destinies of the 70,000 who are said to reside in Utah.</p>

<p rend="center">BRIGHAM YOUNG'S RESIDENCE.</p>

<p>The residence of Brigham Young is on the northern side of Salt Lake City, on a declivity above which the foothills of the Wahsatch Mountains rise. In the View his house is nearly in the centre, and is surmounted by a small square tower with a golden beehive on the top, the emblem of the city.  In this building, which is of timber, his first wife and family reside.  The low building on the left contains the offices of the church.  Next on the left, the principal object in the picture, is the Zion House, where the remainder of his wives reside.  Some say there are twenty of these spiritual wives, others say sixty-one, one for each year of his life.  A smaller (round) tower to the left of the turret on the house surmounts the schoolhouse, a neat edifice, in which the children only of Brigham Young and Heber Kimball only are educated.  The white house on the right of Brigham's was the first erected for him in Salt Lake City, and is now the home of his eldest son and designated successor, Joseph Young.  The buildings on the extreme left in the View are garden houses, offices, and residences of some of the wives.  A wall of earth and stones incloses a large piece of ground, and surrounds Young's and Kimball's premises and gardens.  In the lower corner of the Engraving, on the right, is a portion of the residence of Bishop Wells.</p>
<p>The View and the Portrait are from photographs taken recently by C. R. Savage, late of Southampton, and were brought from Salt Lake City by a gentleman who spent several days there early in September.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Cunard steamer Africa we have news from New York to the 6th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The expeditionary fleet had weathered the fierce gale which beset it, only one tug-boat, one ferry-boat, one gun-boat, and a steam-transport laden with horses and stores, having put back disabled.  On Saturday night, the 2nd inst., the fleet was seen, in fine order, within thirty miles of Bull's Bay, on the coast of South Carolina.  Bull's Bay is twenty-five miles north of Charleston.  It is generally supposed that Captain Dupont will effect a landing at this spot.  His instructions, it is said, are very general, and leave him at liberty to land at such and so many points of the Southern coast as he may see fit.</p>
<p>The blockading squadrons continue to report the capture of English vessels trying to run into the forbidden ports.</p>
<p>The Potomac is still commanded by Confederate batteries, and the "grand army" in the neighbourhood of Washington still maintains its inactive attitude.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia General Floyd had attacked General Rosencranz (Federal) at Gauley Bridge without success.  Two brigades were sent to cut off the retreat of Floyd, whose forces numbered about 7000, and hopes were entertained at Washington that the movement would be successful.</p>
<p>In Kentucky a Federal General captured Prestonsburg, in the extreme western part of the State.  The Confederate General retreated six miles, where he was expected to make a stand.</p>
<p>In Missouri the Confederate Generals Price and M'Culloch had united their forces, numbering 30,000 men, at Neosho, in the south-western angle of the State.  General Fremont's head-quarters were at Springfield when the order arrived relieving him of his command.  The intelligence created great indignation through the camp; many officers signified their intention to resign, whole companies laid down their arms.  General Fremont expostulated with both officers and men, and besought them not to abandon their posts.  He issued a farewell address to the "Mississippi army," exhorting them to continue to his successor the same cordial and enthusiastic support which had been accorded to him, and expressing his deep regret that he should not have the honour to lead them to the victory they were just about to win.  The body guard and Staff and one Brigadier-General (Asboth) remain firm to their personal allegiance, and return with Fremont to St. Louis.  Fremont's successor is General Hunter, his former second in command-a name which was metamorphosed by the telegraph into "Hanks."</p>

<p rend="center">THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S REPORT.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy public opinion that the action of the Administration was justifiable in reference to Fremont, the Cabinet has given to the public the report of the Adjutant-General on which they acted.  It is a tissue of invective against the deposed General, in which General Hunter and the Quartermaster and Paymaster-General figure as prominent accusers.  The following sentence will give the reader a fair idea of the general tone and style of this remarkable document:-</p>

<p>The opinion entertained by gentlemen of position and intelligence who have approached and observed him (Fremont) is that he is more fond of the pomp than of the stern realities of war; that his mind is incapable of fixed attention or strong concentration; that by his mismanagement of affairs since his arrival in Missouri the State has almost been lost; and that if he is continued in command the worst results may be anticipated.</p>

<p rend="center">THE RETIREMENT OF GENERAL SCOTT.</p>

<p>On the 31st ult., General Winfield Scott withdrew from active service on the ground of his increasing physical infirmities.  "For more than three years," he says, "I have been unable to mount a horse or to walk more than a few paces at a time, and that with much pain.  Other and new infirmities-dropsy and vertigo-admonish me that repose of mind and body are necessary to add a little more to a life already protracted much beyond the usual span of man."  The resignation was regretfully accepted, but his full pay and allowances are continued; and a special visit of the Cabinet was made to General Scott's residence to bid him farewell.  An affecting scene took place, in which General Scott shed tears, made a speech, and shook hands with every member of the Cabinet in turn.  General Scott was born in Eastern Virginia on the 13th of June, 1786, and is consequently now in his seventy-sixth year.  He entered the army in 1808.  He was taken prisoner by the British at the battle of Queenstown, and was severely wounded at Lundy's Lane.  His services in the Mexican War are better known.  In 1852 he was the Whig candidate for the Presidency, but was defeated by General Pierce, who was the standard-bearer of by far the stronger party.  Since the revolution commenced it is superfluous that he has repudiated all notion of allegiance to his native State, and devoted himself with all his energies to the cause of the Union.  General Scott, accompanied by several members of his family, is now on his way to Europe.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan received the post vacated by the veteran Scott.  He was born in the city of Philadelphia on the 26th of December, 1826, and is therefore not yet thirty-five years of age.  In the general order to the army announcing his promotion he says hesitation and self-distrust may well accompany the assumption of so vast a responsibility; but, confiding in the excellent qualities of his troops and the favour of Providence to the just cause, he cannot doubt of success.  The municipal authorities of his native city having presented him with a sword, he replied very modestly:-</p>

<p>Nothing that I have yet accomplished  would warrant this high compliment.  It is for the future to determine whether I shall realise the  expectations and hopes that have been centred in me.  I trust and feel that the day is not far distant when I shall return to the place dearest of all others to me, there to spend the balance of my life among the people from whom I have received this beautiful gift.  The war cannot be long.  It may be desperate.  I ask in the future forbearance, patience, and confidence.  With these we can recomplish all.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The Southern journals continue to urge on the planters the necessity of abandoning the cultivation of cotton and tobacco, and the dedication of the land to the production of cereals and meat.  The New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Delta</hi> remarks that prices of breadstuffs had advanced to most exorbitant prices.</p>

<p rend="center">JEWISH DISABILITIES.</p>

<p>A cavalry regiment having been raised in New York city, of which the majority were of the Jewish faith, a Rabbi had applied for the chaplaincy.  The Secretary for War replied that the Act of Congress only allowed the appointment of chaplains who belonged to "some Christian denomination."  The restriction is generally condemned, and public opinion demands that at the ensuing Session of Congress the Act be modified in a liberal sense.</p>
