LONDON: SATITRDA 1', APRIL 15, 1585,

In we do not "drift" into trouble with the Federal States it will not be the fault of noisy speakers and intemperate writers. These individuals are assuredly doing their best to assist in what Lord Palmerston described as the maoefaotnro of American political capital at the expense of England. Of this process, as carried on in Washington and New York, we have, perhaps, no great right to complain, and England has never shown herself harsh in her judgment of the acts of a nation struggling with unexampled difficulty, debt, and diaaater. But we moat protest, and that emphatically, against the attempt of the

¥ American organs hero to break the neutrality which has been proclaimed from the Throne, and which has been recognised by all the temperate and respectable part of the nation. This

¥ attempt has been postponed until the revoreea met by the Federals, and the solemn declaration of the South that nothing shall re-unite it with the North, have exasperated the Union organs beyond all bounds, and it is therefore shown to be a sort of desperate resource, akin to that by which Mr. Lincoln, after showing every willingness to coalesce with the slaveowners, proclaimed freedom to the slaves of "rebels" while retaining the others in bondage. Principle has nothing to do with the matter, and the effort to alter British policy is merely an expedient of war.

This will not do. England has determined net to be dragged into the American struggle if she can possibly avoid it, and thoresolve of a nation ought not to he affected by the sepibbtinge of fanatics or the nonsense of hireling orators, Nor will it be. The agitators against neutrality are the most insignificant per.-due who ever tried to about themselves into notoriety. The names of the speakers at the meetings in aid of Mi'. Seward are names which, in ordinary times, cause a man instinctively to peas on from the report to come other part .of the paper. They have an influence like that of the headings of the advertisements which seek to enlist attention by some paradox to whisk the puff is clumsily appended. The country laughs at such demonstrations. But, for all that, they may become excessively mischievous by their operation in America. Readers there are proverbially ignorant of the relative value and power of on:: public men. The New Yorker who is told in his own paper that Exeter Hall or St. James's Hall has been crowded with aympathieera, end that dory addresses have been delivered to them amid storms of approbation, thinks That all this means something, and has no influence in the national -cooeioils. He does not Irnow, and could scarcely comprehend the facto if laid before him, that a gathering of thirty or forty of our statesmen in a quiet room in Piccadilly or St James's-square would have more to do with

 o directing the policy of the Legislature than be largest crowd

¥ that ever. assembled to cheer Blondin; George Thompson, or Tom Themb. The American does not andoratan,l the ecrrete of Erglieh public life, the formation of public

¥ opinion here, and the certificate of character implied in the position of a leading politician. The New Yorker cannot see why an Edwin James has to emigrate, while a ihoondell Palmer is called upon to advice the Crown on internotional law. Hence these mob-meetings, and the angry and vindictive talk which impudently claims to be the utterance of the people, and is nothing of the hind, will pi-adnee-nay, we believe, are producing-upon the American mind a very evil influence. It will be believed in the North that the Government of England end the people of England are not as one in the

2 matter of neutrality, and the inference will be that: if the North menaces us with war, the people will drive Lord Palneeraton

f fremoffiro end reverse his policy. The idea is so ridiculous to no, of course, that there la danger of one refusing to believe that it oar be entertained in the North, and only those who are really

d aware of the belplece ignorance of the American people (in spite

' of their high education at the bands of the newspapers) open the reel feelings of Ergliehmeo, can entirely appreciate the

a importance of the consideration in question. We can ae,,ro our readers, however, that very fanstatc-nicrits discreditable to England would fail of obtaining belief in America, end that none at all would be rejected by the directors of a large portion

02 of the American press as too outrageous to form texts for fresh abuse of this country. It is painful to have to say this; but it is better to bear any such pain than to permit mischief to go on which may cause quarrel and blood,,hodding.

The Federals, having chant that they either cannot build veeaela whirl: are swift eneeghe to catch the Confederate ornisers,
or cannot spare for that service officers of sufficient skill and spirit to run down these privateers (and there is no lack of brave and able officers in the gallant navy of the North), content themselves with nbnsing England because some of the. Southern vessels have been builtwhere the North may build

equally good ships if it likes-namely, in British dockyards.

The law of England, both domestic and international, is

perfectly clear, and the proceedings which it is necessary to take to prevent the sailing of a chip on a supposed errand of war are as well known to the lawyers as those which are taken! on a dishonoured acceptance. If the case can he proved the vessel is stopped, as has been done,we learn, in the instance of a. newly-constructed beck, which was to have gone by the name of the Alexandra until she had left England and taken in her guns.. But mere suspicion will not do. A policeman does not capture a lounger on mere suspicion that at night he means to "open a bank," with a crowbar for his capitol. Regular evidence must ha adduced; and, whether the lair be sufficiently stringent or not, it is law. We hear very few complaints when expeditions, wider the meet transparent disguises, are fitted out against monarchies, end when adventurers, of more or less respectability, enlist men and buy, guns for the promotion of any revolution whatever, except the Southern revolution. Hitherto the law has heen found to work very well. But an exceptional case, to the minds of sympathisers with the North, has arisen, and these who were foremost in their ostentatious support of insurrectionary movements in Europe clamour against the ordinary English doctrine that proof of guilt shall precede punishment. And even this is not all. The Hence of (loinmona is open to the petitions of the nation and of all classes in the nation; and it is to the Hones of Commons, where a Liberal majority sways, that these malcontents should address themselves for an alteration of the law, if it be deemed too feeble. No such abject end constitutional course will, however, satisfy "the friends of freedom." The Government is called upon to violate the law, to exercise a despotic sway, and to do on behalf of the Northern States of America that which, had it been done on behalf of the King of Naples or the Emperor of Bussis, every organ of Federal interests would have stigmatised most furiously as a proceeding worthy of the days of Oselleceagh end Sidmnnth.

Were the Government to take this course, and act upon suspicion only, it would not only be a violation of British law, and a sacrifice of the traditions which are dearer to us all than any foreign alliance, but a direct departure from the policy announced three times from the Throne. The aympathisare with Mr. Lincoln call on us to interfere on behalf of the Federals, and to treat the South as enemies. We shall not do so; but it is very desirable that the country should understand that these unconstitutional demonstrations, though they

¥ can do no harm here, may produce much in America, and that

¥ the Anglo-American organs ore doing their best to involve us in a horrible war.
THE COMING STRUGGLE AT CHARLESTON-The Cherloeton

correspondent of the dfebde Register writes so follows:-" The struggle, when it comet, will certainly be at a feat-fob character. It will be the shook of tremendous forces, the relative powers of whirls are yet untried. The long. mooted question of the fighting voice of the ships against batteries will he brought as a teat more conclusive than any to which human warfare has yet subjected it. In other words, rice Monitor treortada which the Yankees claim to be the meet impaootnsbbe vessels ever constructed will necessarily come within point-blank rouge of the most numerous and powerful batteries that have over yet been used to a single engagement. We have goad r0000n, too, to believe that our guns will be managed with admirable tart and precision. The more important batteries am manned bytho South Carolina svgalum, far whom the credit h claimed, and I think justly, of beldeg the most expert end practical heavy artillerists in the Confederate army. The fleets are well officered, and General Rtptoy, who line mode the study of heavy ordnance a specialty for years, and whose excellence in that particular branch of military knowledge is on admitted feat, will himself takocommaud at Feet Samtor an soon so the enemy msbmhia appearance. Itlo erarecly posslblethrst any loosing thing can bresetunhereeod the concentrated storm of heavy meted from the guns of Sumtor, Macbrie, end Bettory Boo, the them principal works commending the throat of the harbour. Nor can the peril of running line terrible gauntlet be diminished by an attempt to puce under cover of the darkness, as hoe too. the mae at Viobeborg and New Wears. So tortuous and intricate Is the channel lcodtog to the forte that the most experienced pilots of the harbour wuold not vontoro to be-tog in a vessel by sight, under the conditions which the enemy cannot escape, viz.-without light or landmark to guide the way. Even whoa the bloohado-running vessels fears the harbour Ibis always necessary to aid their exit by previously-arranged lights (shaded) and signals; so that It is reasonably certain that the attacking Iroocbude meet either cuter in open day or incur the imminent homed of getting aground upon one of the most treacherous hem on the Southern coast, which seldom yields a vessel when once it has grasped the heel. But if, yerchaace,deepltoef meoy channel, multiplied derpodees, and the combined batteries of the forts, some of the nine Monitors should olsaum in gel into part, they would still have to encounter a concentrated lire of other batteries, which, as the Yonlcoe papers have learned from cuutrahaedo, 'tins the shores of the interior of the harbour.' And then will come the 'ta,g of war' which will determine the pcoseesbes of the

honoured old city.' -
THE ALABAMA AT PORT ROYAL, JAMAICA.

Own Engraving represents the Alabama as the put into Port Royal,

Jamaica, for repairs after her sharp and decisive engagement with the United Skies' goon-boat Hatteras. Our Correspondent, a young officer of her Majesty's ship Challenger, to whom we are indebted for the sketch from which our Engraving in taken, has also forwarded us a spirited account of the engagement as narrated to ham by one of Captain Semmeo' ocera. "Tne Alabama," writes our Correspondent, 44 was trying to break the blockade off Port Galveston, and came auddeoly upon the Yankee fleet at anchor. She immadcately put about, about, about, but not before she was espied and a large gnu-boat was after her but being a good sailer, the kept her position without any material iotenoa being gained or loot on either side. However, when Captain Soromos thought he was sufficiently clear of the Yankee float, be determined to shorten sail and fight his purenor. So, 'easing lie sheets a little,' to use their own words, up comes this gun-boat, only a vessel of 1200 tons, with eleven guns with a hail, 'Ship-ahoy! Wbat'o your name, and whore bound P Olcooros, the Alabama was all ready prepared, and Captain Ssnooeo answered the hail with 'Alabama, and bound to the-!' and a broadside. The action lasted seventeen minutes, at the expiration of which time the captain of the Yankee vessel, the Hatteras-for that was hername-bailad for q3oarter, saying that she was sinking, and that he wanted asciotanea. &-hey saved 101 men end 17 officers; but there is every reason to believe that some mast have perished, but bow many Captain Ssnunes never could find out, as a strict silence was kept by the Federals on the subject. The Alabama same in here under French colours; but at eight next morning she displayed the Secessionist flag. She came on on the evening of the 20th of January, and started again on the 26th of same month, after¥ having ooaled, revistusilod, and repaired damages. She was etmokinfive places; three maybe seen lnthsflketah I send you. They present a jagged appearance. One little inaldent speaks greatly against the efficiency of the Yankee shells, one of which,

was found in the Alabama's stokehole, after the action, with the face burnt down; but instead of there being powder in the shell et was full of black sand. The action was fought at seventy yards' distance, the Alabama being under sail, while the Yankee was under steam. They landed all their prisoners on the afternoon or the 22nd."

PLANTATION 1iEGROBS WORKING ON THE DEPBNOES OP ONAItLESTON.

Since the breaking out of the civil war there has been but little planting going on near the seaboard of South Carolina in consequence of the too

otoss proximity of the Northern forces. The planters, therefore, are glad to turn over gangs of their negroes to the military authorities, by whom they

are usefully employed in constructing earthworks. There seems little re

to doubt that the negroes work contentedly enough at the task of riveting

their fetters still more tightly upon themselves. Nor is their ragged look to

be in any way attributed to the existence of want or misery among them, to

their toasters' neglect, or to their own indifference to their personal appearance. The negro is perfectly willing to go about his work in rags for six days in the week provided that on the seventh be Maya ttire himself in & garb of outrageous brilliancy. "The very men," writes our Correspondent, "portrayed in my sketch have more than once made me feel uncommonly mean and shabby when I have met them on Sunday in all their splendour and been forced to contrast my own well-worn and somewhat shabby attire with their brilliant costumes. The old uncle in front, who is shown leading off with his rammer is what is here termed the 'boss' nigger or head man of ths party. The reel are under his especial control, and over them he exercises hia power in a right lordly fashion. As those who are working below throw up th80

As a rule, the negroes appear to be the most contented labourera at this and similar work imaginable, and, what with their singing and constant chattering, do as little for their living as any class of men I ever saw." -

THE ATTACK ON FORT WALLISTIM.

Our Correspondent writes as follows respecting the attack by the Federal gun-beifa en Fort Wlifliater, which took place on March 2 :-"Aa I was making up my packet, ready to send off by the first chance I heard of a movement of the Federal gun-boats from Fort Royal towards Savannah. Leaving the envelope open, I started to Fort M'Allister, on the Ogeeehee, 150 miles. off, believing that to be the point threatened, and arrived there juat in time to be present at the attack- here were three turreted ironalada and a mortar-boot engaged, each ironclad being armed with a 15-inch and 11-inch
gun. Alter eight hours of incessant firing the ironclads din oft' leaving, however, the mortarboat etillengaged, which kept throwing shell into the fort the greater portion of the night. Today (the 3rd) none have resumed the attack, but how long it may be before the ball is renewed it is impossible to say. The Pederele are exceedingly anxious to take the position as it will enable them to turn the right of the Savannah defences by reaching the Gulf Railroad. The damage to the fort was trifling-the parapets and revetments somewhat knocked about, a gun dismounted, and a few men injured. It is calculated that at least fifty tons of metal were thrown into the work My sketch is very rough, as it was made amidst flying sand and earth, besides which I had to keep dodging pretty briskly. We hear that the Federal transports are landing troops lower down; if so, we shall have it hot and strong.

 Admiral Ferregut is safe, end commands the Mississippi between Port Hudson end Yiekeburg. He is thus able to step the eerrent of supplies which the Confederates have hitherto received from Texas by way of the Red River.

Admiral Porter's official report of his attempt to reach Yeeee, by wey of the Sunflower River, is published. During eight days he woe-bed his way up with his gun-beats only seventy miles. The channels were exceedingly narrow and filled with obstructions. The expedition was finally checked when within 803 yards of the point Admiral Porter desired to reach. He estimates that the Confederates burned '20,000 bales of cotton along his rents, beside, what he himself burned. Manyplenters manifested affection for the Federal flag. and the negroes were unanimous in devotion to it.

The Confederates have burned two Federal steamers on the Trnneaeee River, and captured the Federal steamer Diana on the Atchafayala River, after a sharp engagement, in which the Federal Ceptain end several gunners were killed.

On the other hand, the Confederate gun-boat Vickeburg broke from her moorings during a storm, and floated down the river until she fell into the hands of Admiral Farraget.

The Confederate, have crossed the Rio Grande into hfsrioe, and captured two Federal officers and three privates (probably "loyal" refegcee from Texas).

called Vanity .Fair, and which aspired to be the Now York Punch. J'anity Fair, after an existence of three or four years, has just expired. That wonderful rowdy "Manhattan" ascribes its downfall to the dearth of comic wrotaxu in America, and. states that an express was cent to England to implore Mr. John Brougham and another Transatlantic humorist to coins out to New York and revive the moribund. journal. We don't think that the reason given is the correct one. There is no lack of writers, facetious or satirical, in the State,. Indeed, our cousins have a natural turn for grim humour and saturnine pers/a9c. The dsfIcultiee against which every comic journal in America has to struggle, and which must ultimately overwhelm it, lie in the paucity, if not the actual non-existence, of clever caricaturists who are accomplished draughtociun as well as satirists. In. England even we can count the really first-rate caricaturist, on our fingers. When Cruikoharik, Phiz. Leech, Doyle, Yesmy Meadows, end Tenniel have been enumerated, how many remain? In Franc,, after Cbam, Dauscsier, Bortall, and Henry Monnier (we don't hold Ilaroiwi or Guotas'e Dm4 to be caricaturist, at all), the catalagaw sinks into mediocrity.

Wr give an Engraving of the Weehawken, one of the nine Federal iron-clad gun-boats onin the recent attack on Charleston. This vessel shows only about sixteen inches above water. Her tower revolves by means of a small engine, and its weight rests on the central shaft, the lower portion of which bears on the keelsons. During action all apertures are shut, ventilation r kept up by two fans, which .9 in sir from the top of the tower, and the boiler - furnace aaxries out all foul air. In one of the enemy boarding, the guns may be brought to bear on deck, and hand-grenades thrown from

the top of the turret. In the engagement at Ullarieston the

Weehawken acted as pioneer, having attached to her bow an )rioeaon raft, intended to lift or explode submarine torpedoes. During the

~ night following the bombardment she lost her raft, which was wished

ashore on Morris Ieland, and taken possession of by the enemy.
- LONDON: SATURDAY, MAY 2, IM,

Toes great "artillery duel," as American writers are so fond of calling what used to be termed a cannonade, seems to have

astounded the Federal organs into something like frankness

and veracity. They admit, almost candidly, that the Confederates have fairly beaten the fleet of the North. We would meet them in a similar opirif, by saying that (apart from the fact that the terrible swagger with which the certain destruction of Charli stun was announced has been mest sadly rebuked) three is nothing to be ashamed of in the repulse that has been sadeirred. The South had deco everything that science couldSuggest to male the harbour impregnable, and the advantages were chiefly on the Confederate side. The lire of the defenders mass awful, and yet but one vessel was sunk and one placed hos do combat, and the Northern commander affected a safe retreat with the others. A "safe retreat" is, to judge by the history of the war, the height of the ambition of Federal land captains; and the Federal sea captains, who have occasionally done much more, are not to be assailed for having simply kept up to the standard of Union successes. It behoves usat home to study this conflict with reference to more important considersfloes than the reputation of American leaders but into this pert of the business we do not propose to enter at present.

Charleston is deride. It is said that Washington, in North

Carolina, baa been relieved; but we are uncertain on this point

tickaburg is described as being prepared for the fiercest attack, and victuelled for the longest siege likely to be laid. There are the uenal rumours of mysterious movements, and of great things that are to be suddenly done ; but we might keep this sentence in stereotype, as also its usual lame anti-climax, which arrives with the nat batch of telegrams, The war may be said, briefly, to he in the most unsatisfactory state as regards the North; and die roper of largest circulation there distinctly asserts that a trials is approaching in which it will be necessary to hand over the Union to a military dictator and despot-the words are the journal's own. It comforts the people by precedents to show that the natural progress of all Statee is from liberty to despotism; so that, we presume, England, who thinks herself not to be entirely without some little remnant of freedom, is considered to helm a transition condition. We can wait.

Meantime, and while looking nut for a dictator, and c-hUe the many Isles every opportunity of cheering "little Mae," the dew made Fresbytu-lan, in proof that the soldiers comprehend the real meaning of the elaborate pamphlet published

:'fiairlat l,ius by tile Ilepchliran cc,, miesigucra, the American Ceveesaneart, ne are told, Iras sr.cde up its mind to inform Earl
Russell that if auotcr vessel of English build gets into the bends of the Confederates, Load Lyons and Mr. Adams shall charge places. Of course, if this he true, the probabilities are in favour of a collision. We think we may assume it as certain that no one, save the workers of the American press Ia London, will ask Lord Russell to propose to Parliainuat to change tIi law-the Foreign Enlistment law. Even to please Mr. Seward, we are not prepared to accelerate the progress which we are said to be making along the road to a despotism. We must continue to adhere to the old Saxon rule which, its the snout unenlightened manner, prescribes that there shall be some evidence of guilt before anybody is punished. The law has been fairly worked. In one single ease an offender escaped us, as hundreds have escaped from the vigilance of the American authorities themselves, though they had ten times the means of preventing such escapes, and were hound by no superstitions regard for the arrangements called laws. But where evidence could be obtained we have interfered, and the Alexandra lies in helpless captivity. Mr. Seward knows all this perfectly well, and we doubt not that at his own table bespeaks with all recoguitiOn of the bone thins of the English Government, though the necessities of party, for which we make all allowance, induce him to permit agitation against this country, and may have even driven him to the extreme step of requiring us to commit illegal acts in order to sttisfy the North. We speak of Mr. Seward, for it is clear that the Government has virtually passed from the hands of the goodnatured attorney, who ought to have been left to entertain his friends with highly-flavoured anecdotes in Kentucky. Mr. Seward must understand that there is nothing England would so much hate as a war with America, except one thing, and that is a cowardly suet thee of an Englishman's rights to the protection of the law, until it can be shown that there is a priand facie case for converting the protector into a PunhslC1

 We are not, however, in the absence of more specific. info r. mallen, inclined to believe that Mr. Seward has clone more than reiterate the complaints which have been so conclusively answered by Earl Russell, oven if the American statesman has done so much. The kind of despatch which has been described would leave next to nothing to be done beyond a recall of Lord Lions, and then the fatal preparation for that for which Mr. Roebuck, in language that cannot be condemned more strongly than it. deserves, needlessly stated we were ready, calling out himself the indignant reproof of the gencrous.heartecl Moucklon Mimes. For such an issue we believe that n states. man in America is really pecpared; and the mercantile and educated classes would, we imagine, signify in an unmistakable *y, at need, that the destinies of their country had been played with long enough. The instant recognition of the South would follow, the blockade would be. forced wherever it interfered with commerce, and if France did not rash into the quarrel it would only be because her mediatiosi wou1c sought by those who have so rudely repulsed it, in confidence in the will and power Of England to keep her ally in good temper. We aced not point to Canada in arms to the strength of that pcsitlou about which so much uconsenso has been talked, but which American soldiers are now declaring to be es formidable as anything in the South for to the invasion qf Canada we do not believe the war would ever come. But for any part of this programme the American Government is unprepared, and Mr. Seward will hardly have risked new damage to the amoar prtpn't' of hi subjects by sending a despatch which can receive no notice beyond acknowledgment, We should hear, with a gladness for which the American press will give us no credit, but which tl better nature of those who sent the Griswold to Liverpool will surely no clerstrmd, that the Charleston lesson, in which there is no disgrace, has been accepted by the North as a final intimation that the crimson flag with the blue cross is not to be pulled down, and therefore had batter be saluted. We write these lines on the anniversary of the proclamation of European peace seven pears ago, and wish we could, find an omen in the date.
SKETCHES IN PARLIAMENT.

7iccs is not so humdrum a Session after all. The old features fire cc misg out, and the only new habit that prevails as yet is that late aitfirs are the exception, end there is a tone of remonstrance about the lower Hence against lapsing into that pernicious eastern. It is curious to observe how little influence the Government peseossas in the regulation and management of the Commons-witness the other night, when the first of the two debates on our relations with America which have occurred in the lasi live or air days was forced en against the manifest reluctance of Ministers. Mr Bsntfnclr had given notice of a motion, which would have brought the subject on; Kt it s rrmed that attempts had been made to etavait oil, and it is poceiblo that the formal motion might have been begged away. But Er, llcrbnclr,in an atrabilaricus rage, dashedinto an extempore assault en his qnondsm'brothere across the Atlantic, and proceeded, in his summary and execrating macthor, to put them out of the pale of ossilised humsuily. He get up a raw, and was splashing about in the turmoil with evident enjoyment, when Lord Palmerston tried to stop hint by the artful device of jumping up to answer a question he had Asked during one of those pauses which lsesometimes makes withmterst to concentrate bin rrienimetit into me special and high-spiced anathcma. Best in vain. Mr. Rational: bad reviewed his vocabulary of contempt and soloated his adequate phrases, and he was not to be baulked in their enunciation

sndho wasnet. The sensitive believers an Federal exoollonoo shuddered and obreelc froth the hot blast of his indignation; and Mr. Bentinok, being n atursily annoyed at having his coosparativoly mild thunder -anticipated was not to be tempted by the meek request of the Premier to Isthim move the grant for the memorial to the Prince Concoct before the motions name on, doubtless in the belief that that subject might produce n feeling of harmony, the eltacts of which would neutralise the acidity, not to say bitterness, of the subecqurut discussion. But it was clear that the Aeucricau question had got together a large House, the Opposition mustering in fares; and cc Mr. Bentiurk went on in what would bave boon a forcible style bad it rot him weakened by contrast with Mr. Pitebuek's miraculous flow of ace tbity. And so the debate continued, and Mr. Maims was able to state, nith bisususi rotund emphatic, that ho felt himself "humiliated every morning" at the insults inflicted by Commodore Wilkac en the British Bag; and Mr. Bernal Osborne-who was supposed to have, for this Eesaionat least, abandoned Parliamentary flowers of speech for the cultivation of cabbages in Ireland, hot who somehow or ether turned up when arrangements for filling vacant offices were in psvgrece-wae enabled to Assume an sir of virtuous severity, and to rebuke those who sought to promote irritation in America, and who, lie insinuated, were in doubt whether the interests and honour of the country were safe in the hands of that very Government; which last July hi himeeif denounced in his most powerful and therefore most diaegrccable style.

 Much more digeifled and argumentative was the second dircusaisn en this subject, which was initiated by Mr. Hersfali in a most able and impressive speech, end which was eupplamantod. by Mr. Cobdsn in his snctisn from the ether point of view-namely, that of placating the Pcderalewlaile Mr. Horsisil demanded that they slyonld. net have ovcrjthihg theft own way. No man has proved more practically than Mr. Cobden his faith in American institutionI and American people; for he trusted them with his money, and lost it. That he is net mercenary, and that he hardly understands the value of money, he has also proved; and therefore it, is probable that he of all men would ho lssst likely to have has convictions in. a nation shaken by the lees of mere pall; but certainly it doss seem something verging on simplicity to heir him arguing, and -with no little skill, that the nasmal tendency of the Americans has been. to forbearance and kindly dealing to this country. The ingenuity with which on the peasant occasion he illustratedtbisdpgma from the oconn'sneoe of the robelhonin Canada, was remarkable; and his whole Argument and speech, delivered as earnestly and in such trod faith, angered on amiable credulity whirlapeoplo have somehow begun to discover is a paramount quality in see whom they had once thought the very type and symbol of a bard-headed, practical man. In these international debates it was amusing, but at the same time rather painful, to witness the quiet deposition of (ha that law officer of the Orswn from the chief pleas as the organ of the Government. In the present ease, as there were two debates, although the subject Y. as cognate, the Solioltor-Osnaral was resorted to sum up the mass in that which was specially originated by Mr. Cobdeu; and therefore it was necessary, that the Attorney(Irnarsi should take an early part in the discussion. It was cruel of Mr. Wbitsside to say that this high legal functionary had missed all the points, but that be supposed the Solicitor-General could supply the deficiencies of his senior officer; and it was cruel of the House to burst into ironical laughter when, later, the Sslieitor.Ganeral, with some naivete, caid that he thought his noble and learned friend had not been understood. But when the House takes up sue idea about one of its members it seldom, if aver, relinquishes ii; and so en able leveler and a practical man of business, who has fought his way to the highest positions in his profession, is placed under a Parliament esy ostracism, principally, as we believe, because he has not ctuglst the knack of the pines. In enewer to Mr. Whitoside's call, there cams a response from the Solicitor-General in posoe; that is Mr. Collier, who intarvenad, and enabled the Solicitor-Usneral its sate to bold his allotted place-in the debate. The feature of the discussion, bewevea was the Appearance, for the first time this Session, of Mr. Rcrscnon; and he draw all the eoverte of the Houss for everybody flcekrd in to hear him. Well, he was tens to his inspirations, for such a tisauo of gentlemanly imprecation flowed from him as perhaps even he lass nnvdr befero prsduoed; One understands Mr. Itoobnsk'e rugged irsaoibility, and the spontsnsity of his ire; when he says bitter things, anddencunces, like Habablcok Muolrlsssrath, eve know that the man sam a rags, and that the Abundance of his heartis pouring throggb his lips. But ens does not comprehend the cold, calm delivery, in rounded, polished sentences, of a prepared oration, which consists of: tthe sharpest and most virulent abuse, which does not seam to rub, from the midst of a white heat at passion, but to odes out of an aesomulated mess of lllhoimoar and dislike.

 he absolutely shocked Mr. Bernal Oeboinc f. -

ALLEGED ENLISTMENT OF BRITfSH SUBJECTS FOR T1111 FEnteocAb Aaat.ev.-Wo loam from a lohiobook just ironed that some corre

spetudenco lisa passed between Earl Russell and Mr. Adams on the subject the alleged recruiting in the United Kingdom for the Federal army. As tow back a the 20th et November last, the Foreign Secretary intimated to the United States' Minister that the Government had been informed by persons "to whom they were disposed to give credit" that recruiting for the Nortleeni. cervion was being carried on in this country by agents who altered large bounties. Mr. Manes gave a general dental to the report, and Earl ltnsosll eseboeqeecotly informed his Excellency that, further inquiries showed that the ntttcmOaota as to the 'alleged recruiting in London" were without foundation. On the 18h Inst., however, tire noble Earl, called Mr. Adaaao'B attention to the ereteccire emigration from Ireland-rcmnsrklng that a report which had reached the Government on the subject was to the effect that "it. cannot be doubled that the emigrants era intended for the United State" army, and that, in fact, many of them do not deny it." Mr. Adams replied. that numerous applications had been made to him for a face passage, and that a considerable proportion of these contained offers to enhiat In the soti'iae O

the Northern (internment. But he had uniformly, rejected these proposals, essi lead instructed the consular agents of the Federal States to decline all such effect. "I have noreason tobolicve," h,'edUed, "that city American oitlal010 in Misplaced, clothed with authority, has ventured to act in any other W5y." Mr. Adams also appease to have complained of the Confederate lean and the capply of arms to the South, best Earl Russell maintained for lila conobryincan a right, which the Americans themselves have always assorted, to lend money or sell nanaeitiolaa of war to a belligerent. Another grievance of the Federal Minister was that English cellars had entered the naval service of the Goat' federate ideates; but Bail Russell retorted with a request that ' before you repeaL 'car, ecisplaiaeae that British callers hart. entered the serviec at the socalled Ceafederate States, you will furilisit me with proofs that oil British rsibjrota reeving in the Federal army or navy have been ellseliargeil, and orders given not to relict or eugene such lrrwom to serve In arena contrary to that lectern tf her Majesty's procloucaticai."
THE ATTACK ON CHA3LESTON.

Admiral Dopont, who coonnanded the Federal iron fleet in the attack on Charleston, has mode his report of the engagement to the Secretary of the Navy, but it has not been published, as the Government "does not consider it sufficiently explicit." But descriptions of the whole attack have been given by the New York journals.

The expedition had been in preparation for a considerable time. As the iron vessels were completed they were collected on the Secnh Carolina coast,

and daring the week preceding the 7th of April the fleet had been nuietly assembling in the North Edisto River, which is about midway between Port Royal and Charleston. The whole force consisted of nine iron cased steamers or Monitors-the name of the first vessel of the kind constructed for actual service having been adopted to describe the entire class. There waa a squadron of reserve, consisting of five more vessels, which were to have supported the attack, but these ships took no part in the engagement.

The Federal fleet crossed the bar on the morning of the 5th of April and anchored inside it, in the main ship channel. The old passage through the bar has been abstracted by the "atone fleet" the Federals sunk in it with the intention to destroy the harbour; but the action of the tides has farmed anew channel, and through this the Monitors paused.

The following description of the position of the forts renders the accounts of the engagement Intelligible, and, indeed, explains the defeat. The only channels of entrance were commanded and swept by the heavy gone of the forte and batteries. All the defensive works mentioned, except Forts floonter and Real trio, have been constructed since the commencement of the war

 "Ta the left of the channel, on entering Charleston harbour, is Morris Inland, and is the right Sasllivan's sland. The batteries on the former command the maims ship channel, and those on the latter the Swash and North Channel. In front and at short range from these channels Is Fort Sumter, with Fort Monltrle apposite, on the right, and the fort on Comocolog's Paint at the left. All the principal channels converge and ran between MonlIris and Sumter, and beyond these are Foot Ripley, and Castle Pinelmey. On Sofllvan'e Island is a battery at the north end, guarding Breach Inlet, which Is too distant to disturb the passage of our vessels, and nearer, and close to the Mooltu-le Hotel, in a strong sand battery called Port Beauregard; south of Comnmiog's Point Battery is Fort Wagner; and there is another fortification on the inlet whiola divides Morris from Folly Island.

The nine Monitors engaged were the Woehawken (with an Brleseon raft chained to her bow); the Paessaie, Captain Percival Draytsn; the Monlank, Commander John L. Warden; the Patapeco, Commander Daniel Amman; the Now Ironsides, Commander Thomas Turner; the Catskill, Commander il. W. Rogers- the Nantucket, Commander Donald MN; Fairfax; the Nahant, Commander John Dcwnso; and the lisekeek, Lieutenant. Commander Alexander G. Thud.

Admiral Dupont was on board the New Ircnaidea, from which all the signals wore made. Atone o'clock, altar a short prayer had been read by the Captain of the Ironsidsa, the fleet advanced to the attack in single line, the ships following each other in the order in which they are named above. A delay of nearly an hear was canoed by the raft of the Weehawken, intended to his or explode the submarine torpedoes, becoming entangled. At two o'clock, however, all was clear again, and the line advanced. The first ship, the Weolaawkeo, was nearly fear miles from the point the float, was Ordered to make before opening fire; and all the batteries on Morris Island, the ships passing within easy range of each, had to be ran. As the vessels steamed slowly by, however, the forts on the island were silent. The Confederates reserved their fire I It coald be delivered with the otmoet Possible effect. At three in the afternoon the fleet rounded the point coming within the range of the guns of Fort Sumter and the batteries on Scllivan'a Island. They opened their fire on the advancing ships, and with terrible results,

 The correspondent of the I'ribaae, who was on board the Irunsidas says

"Six bells had just struck when a doll sound, like that of a sledge.'hamaosar upon an anvil, was board on the bow-port aids. It was the hostile greeting of Fort Sumter, now Within 1155 yards of us. A. second and third, more violently than the first, shook the aides of the ship. Soon came whizzing and humming of rifled and round shot and shell overhead. Still the successive discharges could be distinguished. The several reports bed not yet been drowned, so to speak , in a continuous roar. But, hark I there is a'ravarhsration as though of numerous, simultaneous thunder-claps; now a fierce nocsaaing roar vibrating the air with a violence that causes even the solid mass of our ship to tremble. A leek through the span port on the port side discloses the cause of the furious Outburst. The first fear Monitors had reached the converging point of the lire of Cummiog's Point Battery, Forts Sneutec' and Moultris, and Battery Boo. One after the other had steadily steamed, without thing a shot, to the verge of the concentrating ranges. The enemy evidently reserved their main fire for work at close quarters; but when the Weehawlson had reached within (100 yards of Fort Sumter a bog, bread, brilliant flame suddenly leaped from its aide, with all but simultaneous intense glares from Comming e Point and Muoltrie, followed instantaneously by Immsnac volumes Of smoke and a rain of Projectiles that fairly hid the turrets of our craft with spouts of water thrown up by the abet and shell.

 At this point of the action it was discovered that the outran uo channels were abstracted by lines of piles stretching acrasatham, which it was impossible to peso.

The report of the New York Times says:-" You can readily conceive that

this unleekcd-for catcppet utterly deranged the original intentions. The rebels were quite as well aware as we that the north-west fans of Ssemter is it. weakest point; that it was, hi fact, never finished, and therefore that ft would be first attacked; and they used means which admirable engineering skill would suggest to prevent our reaching it. Thus brought to a pause, it nnly remained for the irenulada to isles up such positions as they could. se, the complication was feather increased by the all-behaviour of the flagship, the Irsusnidsa. While steaming along up through the passage in front of Blunter she was caught by the tideway and veered off from her course, and, bar hugs iron frame refusing to obey her rudder, she became isa great part unmanageable. This embarrassed nether nnl.y, but all that portion of the fleet following bar. The two Monitors immediately behind (the Catskill and the Nantucket) fell foul of her, one on one side and the other on the other, and it was full fifteen minutes before they could be get clear and pass on. In this plight it Only remained for Admiral llupont to signal to the fleet to disregard the movcmenteefthefiagslsip. Thiehedid, and tbeshipstbaeueasomed such poeltions as were available and they could gain, the whole number being at the mouth of the hsrbcsar between Caminiog's Point Red Sullivan's Inland, and opposite the north-east and sastem face of Fort Sumter, at distances of from (100 to 1000 yards. While the mausoovree rapidly indicated in these paragraphs an going an, you must not suppose the enemy is inactive. The powerful wait on CUM-11319's Point, named Battery Bee, opens; the long-range ride ordnance of Fort Beauregard joins in; Moulteto hurls its heavy metal; the lii guns that line the Bedan swell the firs; and the tremendous armament of Sumter vomits forth its fiery hail. There now ensues a period of not more than thirty minutes, Which loran the climax and white heat of the fight; for though from the time when the was opened on the bead of the approaching line to the time when the retiring fleet passed out of the enemy's rouge covered an interval of two hours and a halffrom half-past two till five, yet the essence of the fight was shut op in these thirty tremendous minutes."

 It being impossible longer to face the fire of 30 0 guns of the heaviest calibre,

or to advance under it, the signal was made to cease action and retire. The engagement ended at a few minutes after five o'clock:

THE ALEXANDRA.

TmcorTGII the courtesy of Mr. William Woods of Queen's

rose!, Liverpool, we are enabled to give an illustration of

the Alexandra, recently seized at Liverpool by order of the Government on suspicion that he was intended for the use of the confederates, The Alexandra was built by Masers, Miller and Co., of Liverpool, for Messrs. Fa'woott, Prescott, and Co., of the same town, both Inns being of long standing and great respectability. She was built, launched, and fttted, out in dock, when, on the 6th ult., a custom-houeo officer went on board, and gave e notice to the folio-wing shea's -"I have herewith to inform you that, pursuant to the directions of the Collector of Customs, the vessel Alexandra, built by you, line been seined, and will be detained until further instructions shall be received as to the course to be our

ILLUSTRATION OF P115 ATTACK ON CHARLESTON.

Tan unsuccessful attempt on Ctarleeion by the Federal iron-clad

fleet has so recently been detailed in this Journal that it will not be necesesry to give more than a few partioulace of the fleet's advance, in relation to which we have an Engraving on the preceding page. "The attack," says the correspondent of the iVi'tc York Hove/d, "would have commenced an hour or two earlier then it did had it not been that the Admiral was advised to wait far the ebb tedo, rather than earl up with the deed tide, no the former would be more apt to discover the locality of the obstructions in the channel; and the tide turned at eleven o'clock. Doting thoee hours of suspense the eye had an opportunity at taking the features of the scene on which the great act was to be played. The blue waters danced in the bright sunshine, and flocks of sea-birds dipped their white wings in the waves and uttered their ehritl cries as they ewoepod downward after their prey. Over the parapoto of Ferte Sumlar end Moultrie the cebeldefendere were watching our movements cod eigoalieing them; end even on the roofs end steeples of the distant city we could 000 hundreds of spectators. Distinctly in view were the numerous batteries extending from the Wappcc Creek c ii the Aahley River, following the contour of limes Island down to the Lighthouse Battery, on the south point of Mends Island. On the other aide they were more numerous still.

Meanwhile the attaching vessels lay at anchor in the main ship channel, within a nub of the batteries on Moms Island, without provoking a hostile shot. They lay in the airier named in the plea of attack, as follows -The Weehawkea. yceeste, Moetauk, Patapeco, New Iransides, Katekill, Nantucket, Nelcant0 and ltaokuk. Frye ships

 a were in reserve. At half-past twelve the fleet commenced to move. me The diatanco to the positions at which they were directed to attack h was nearly font miles, and for almost all that distance they were it within range of the enemy's batteries. But again there was a delay. re Grappling-irons attached to the Weebawicon had got foul of her ty snahor- cable, and it teak nearly en hour in eel enattom right. Ablest c. the difficulty wan got over, and once more the vessels were underway. s Slowly they may. up the ship channel. They paused within easy range of Fact Wagner on Mocois Island, but not a shot disputed their program; they passed the battery at Gumming's Point, named, I o believe, Battecy Boo, but still not a discharge from a rebel gun. And

¥ it wee net till the vessels had got fairly b-tweon the two upper points of Mends Inland and Sullivan's Island, which are about a male apart, and were rounding to make the entrance of the harbour, that the ominous stillness wanbraken. Fart Ssmtcr opened the boil with her

barbotle 5uns; Foci tfsuitrie took up the loud refrain. The various

batteries joined in the deafening chorus, and the iounolado found themselves within a circle of fire, concentrated from all the rebel geuso that could be brought in bear upon the paint."
