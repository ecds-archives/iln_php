r'nMUL ATTACK ON THE ULOABGUR DBThNOES OF CadIeLEMIT. (ftem ear Special Ocrrespoe'fel&)

Charleston, April 5.

Arlength the long expected moment arrives. Nine peaerellronolld ore scan off the Box, aocomponied by twenty-foor wooden vessels of war, while others are coming up in the distance. A greet number of transports having troops on board are in the mouth of the "Steno

Biter, end GOOD Federal soldiers have been. already landed on" Cole's"

Island. Their object is to take the land defences of Charleston in the

flask, while the fleet make an effort to force a Passage past the forte. Should they succeed, the city of Charleston will lie at the merry of the North, endite cause, which has sustained so many disappointments and repulses, will receIve a great encouragement. But I have every faith in the result of the coming encounter, for never at any time have the Confederates been more determined to do or die then they express themselves now. Every preparation has been made, every appliance pressed into service by General Ripley, the Brigadier commanding, to give the fee a worm reception; end, Surrounded as he is, aprently by obstacles that appear ineurmeontable, his zed end success seem perfectly wonderful. His headquarters during the coming fight will he in Pert Sumter itself, end, as he expresses it, he will 'fight it low down' until net a brick nor stone is left for another to root upon before he gives in. If the mailclad monsters now in the offing ere repulsed, it will be to General Ripley end the brave man under him that victory will be due. I send you now a sketch of sinking torpedoes by moonlight in the ehannela by which the enemy will probably advance to the attack. As this letter mast run the gauntlet of the blockading squadron, end may very probably be captured, I will be silent as to how many thousand pounds of powder are contained in each of these strange engines of warfare. In my next letter I will do my beet to give a graphic account with pen end pencil of the impending fight, which will be assuredly one of the most extraordinary ever witnessedarmourplated Ships against send-batteries, earthwork end brick end stone forts.

 Pert Sumter, Charleston Harbour, Morning of Spoil S.

The antcualy.awaited attack took place yesterday afternoon, at three p.m. I immediately started for Fort Sumter, whence I intended to witness the fight. Upon my way, as I crossed the Battery promenade to the boat, a scene met my eye which demonstrated undoubtedly that the ladies of Charleston had he undue fear for the result of the attack, which, if suocoaeful, would place their homes at the mercy of an exasperated foe. I sketched the scene, end finished the drawing in the evening, while the garrison of Port Sumter were repairing damages. The engagement, of which no doubt you have received full partirulare, lasted two hours and twenty-five minutes. There were eight turreted iranolada, including the boasted double-teoreted 'Kookuk' end an immense plated frigate known as the Ironaidce. .Alltheee marine menders was armcdwith eleven end fifteen inch guns. They were all struck by the forts repeatedly; and, after maintaining the fight for the time I named, they steamed away, evidently mach damaged. Thin morning we have ample evidence of the fact. The Keokok has sunk, while another of the Monitors has been towed away South, disabled. Six h-onclada only an left off Mortla Island, anchored out of range of our guns. Withthemia the Ironaidea, with all herpumpe at work, proving plainly enough that she hadheen bit below the water-line. Clothes clotted with bleed have been picked up that have floated from the Keokok, end there can be little doubt that she was pierced through and through, and that the lose of His on board her has been severe. Iwiliforward other Sketches as cpportunlty efface of the incidents of the fight0 the thickeot port of which I witnessed from this place. The Confederate lose does not amount to more than fear men killed and about a dozen wounded. There were a few casualties here, and we had two of our guns dismounted by the fire fromthe ships. The fight maybe renewed at any moment if the pedards have the stomach fer the attempt; but I think they have suffered too much to provoke another encounter, In my sketch of the Battery promenade during the fight, Castle Pinakney may be aeon in the foreground to the left; then Battery Bee, Portbteultris, end Fort Beauregard, on Sulliven'e Island. In the centre is Fart Sumter, with the Keokuk to the left and the other tuoretedironelada, Between Sumter and Cummiog'e Feint Batteries, on Morris bland, on the right, are other Monitors, end the Troonidea, The enell, isolated fort in the eantre middle distance is Pert Biploy. The Yankee transports have landed some thousands of men on Folly Island, South of Morris Island, who will, as soon as possible, receive every attention.

Evming of April 8,

My Sketch shows all that remains of the boasted Keckuk, that was

to take so great a share in destroying Fort Sumter end forcing an

entrance into Charleston Harbour. In all probability her guns will

be recovered by the Confederates, and the vessel itself maybe raised, should the remainder of the Yankee fleet follow the example of the

¥ Monitor, which has already retired in a helpless condition, apparently,

from the scone of motion.

The operations of the French in Mexico seostere long be can. ducted on a large sonic; and if the policy which is supposed to have dictated that expedition be carried not, it will involve 0 war between Prince and the Northern States of America, the former power becoming the ally o the Confederates. liven if such on event be thought somewhat remote, at can hardly be denied that whore so many small causes of difference, if not of diopete, exist at present between England and the Federal States, they may at any moment take an aggregate shape and ripen into a reseat kohl. So moos for the prospects of the future; a word or two now on actualities.

Probably at no period of the contest in America lees more in teeest been felt than In the movements of General Hooker, the present commander of the Army of the Potomac. Haquestionably some sympathy is felt fee a Federal General who exhibits at ones boldness and chili. The tactics whish Beaker adopted bad within them the elements of brilliant nsceess; hot the materials with which he hail to work are spparesstly unfitted for such a system as he has pursued, copenally when bets opposed to leaders en daring and vigilantes Lee and .Taeksosr, ably seconded as they are by their singularly Mobile troops. By a bold and unexpected movement Hooker,

 elivtdbeg his forces end crossing .the Happahannoclc at dif-ferent potato, succeeded in placing the bulk of his army an the most between Fcedcrieksboeg and Richmond, and, therefore, in the rear of the Confederates, leaving a corps ,miler General Sedgwiek to occupy the attention of the enemy by advancing upon the battle-field of Fredericksburg. Not in the leant taken aback, Stonewall Jackson, by a rapid Counter movement, onlilasaked Honker himself, and fell fiercely oil, Me right wing; and for two days a series of obstinate eaeeenters-a battle, divided as it were, into four or five aoteensued. and when the latest accounts left America there could be no doubt of Hooker's entire failurs. On the third day, he was standing on the defensive, intrecnlelcg himself, his front sempletoly changed, no longer between the Confederates and Richmond. He had their whole army in his front and the rivers ltappehamaeek and itapidan in his rear ; while Sedgwiek'a corps, which had continued to threaten the Confederate army, was assailed,defentedwitla great less, and driven hack aseroostharivor. The position of the Federal General is such that he will be subjected to an attack in force by the Confederates, and, unless a military miracle In wrought, we do not ace anything for him bar a choice between capitulation and being driven into one of two riven, according to his selection. Assuming his defeat. the question arises whether such an occurrence will be considered decisive of the war. We confess we think not. It would be quite possible for the Confederate Army to follow Meeker and march upon Washington, but it is much to be doubted whether such a course will be pursued. Apart from the perils of an attack on Washington, which city would of stems he defended by the concentration of all the Federal troops whirls could he got there, en that something like a, siege would ensue. It is not unlikely that the Confederate statesmen would look at an araault on the mpitai of the once United Btatrn more from a political than a military paint of viewThe Capture of Washington by the Seceesioniete would urns. perate the Northerners and goad them to froth eltorts against the South; while, as amatteref policy, itmayseorn to Jefferson BRAS and his advisers judicious to let it appear that the war is net aggressive on their port,

LONDON: SATURDAY, MAY 2, 1803.

Ma. 13 RIGHT'S avowal of regret that the trades unions in this country do not take more action in political matters has not been expressed in vain, Encouraged by the member for Birmingham, the unions have been pleased to approach Mr. Adams, the American Minister here, with information as to their opinion upon the Fdcru1 and Confederate struggle, and have also favoured Lord Palmerston with a visit in the interest of Poland, and with suggestions for the benefit of the Foreign Office. Neither demonstration should be treated disrespect
fully, for there is no doubt that, though the individuals cornposing the deputations may have no personal claim to public attention, they have been instructed to utter the sentiments which happen at present to be those of a very large number of English workmen.

The unions told Mr. Adams that they believed the cause of the North to be the cause of freedom, that they wished. for the success of Mr. Lincoln's armies, and that any English sympathy that was manifested for the Confederates was entertained by other than the working classes. The deputation would not have fairly represented the order of salad which is usually found among the humbler orders, and would have been unworthy pupils of Mr. Bright, had they confined themselves to these stair. ments and failed to impute unworthy motives to other persons. It was fitting, therefore, that Mr. Adams should be told, that the educated classes in this country favour the South from enmity to democratic principles, and because personal interests are involved in the maintenance of an aristocratic system against wbiqh American institutions are a standing protest. We are not disposed to speak harshly even of this kind of talk. It is the language which is taught by the inferior press, and largely used in "the poor man's club," and it is a thousand times better that working men should speak out what they think to be truth than that they should mutter it in secret societies, or whisper it in exchange for pass. words and handgrips, or that they should dilate their linest nonsense with the washy platitudes dear to vestrymen and hireling orators. If they really think that all the parsons who are so much better qualified than themselves to form an opinion upon a question of foreign affairs are either haughty tyrants or interested knaves, by all means let them say so, and thus give a practical answer to certain other persons who affect to believe that the English workman requires an elaborate machinery of protection to enable him to express the political sentiments which he is afraid to utter in the face of his conntrynieie.

 We are not vain enough to suppose that we arc favoured with the ear of many of these who waited upon Mr. Adams, or that it would be very profitable to attempt to show them that one may be neither a tyrant nor a knave and yet be unconvinced that Mr. Lincoln is a patriot, and that the devastation of a vast and beautiful country is wan-anted even for the sake of forcing slave emancipation, were such the object of the invaders. Were we likely to be listened to, we might urge that white men have their rights to freedom as well so black neon, end, moreover, that if Mr. Dane were to-morrow to send an envoy to Mr. Lincoln announcing the submission of the South on condition that the "domestic institution" were to remain intact, not only would peace be made on these terms by the next telegraph, but Mr. Davis's envoy would be the most popular individual in the Northern States. Re would be photographed, fited, serenaded, and the next week would be anything but a pleasant period in the life of 'Massa Greeley," and such of his sable protdgds as might come in the way of the exulting patriots of Federalia. This is, how-ever, so perfectly well known to every dispassionate person that it is almost wonderful that messes of our fellow.cnontrysrlen can be blind to the fact.. But they have been told that this is a war for the freedom of the slave, and they accept with child-like faith an idea which it is so -very easy to grasp, end reproduce with au iteration that would be ludicrous if we could see anything diverting in the ignorance of men who honestly believe themselves qualified to govern the State.

While, however, the working class confines itself to an approbation, upon wrong grounds, of the policy of the Government of England, and restricts itself to a regret that our non-intervention cannot be reconciled with active measures in favour of the Northern States, there can be no serious quarrel with men who do no wrong, but simply blunder. We are not going to interfere for the South; we seize steamers that appear to have been fitted out with that intention we encourage no breaking of the blockade; and Earl Russell and the Earl of Derby, as repre. sentatives of the two powers in Parliament, go out of their way to compliment the Prize Courts of America, and to declare that allowance ought to be made for the natural Irritation of the Federals at the numerous attempts made by our merehoantsto sell munitions of war to the South. So far all classes are happily

at one and this is well. Bat e a vice 0 F. "xi IN

On the evening of Tuesday, the 5th, General Hooker, finding his communications threatened, commenced his retreat across the Rappa)aeanock, which was swollen by a tremendous torrent of rain. The south tide of the Rappahaunook was evacuated before noon on the 6th. Nearly all of the army had crossed before the Confodoratos, found out that the Federale were retreating, and then they brought up a few pieces of artillery, which the Federal cannon drove bath. On this day General Hooker issued, from his head-gnartcre at Falmouth, an order of the day, wherein he claims that the army of the Potomac had indicted heavier blows than those they had received.

/ WARRENTON, VIRGINIA,

(From a Covospcoc!ecl.)

NEXT to Fredericksburg the only place of any importance included

within the area of the late four days' battles in Virginia is Wetrenton, sometimes called Warrington.

This town is the capital of Fatquier (pronounced Forkeer) County, end has three or four thousand inhabitants. It has for many years been a fashionable resort during the summer, on account of the mineral springs in its neighbourhood. It is noted for its healthfultees end its beautiful scenery near the Blue Ridge mountains. It is about twelve miles from the Gordoneville, Culpepper and Maneesas Railroad, at the termination of a branch leading directly to the town. At this point the engagement took place between the Federal Colonel Dc Forrest, and the Confederate cavalry under Colonel Moseley, known as the "Black Horse Cavalry," and which was first organised in Fanquier County. It was probably merely a slmirmmdeh, or surprise, though variously described as a "reconnoieeance," a "heavy fight," and a "terrific charge;" in which "the rebels were scattered in every direction."

Warrenton has been for a whole year in the miserable plight of a

border town held alternately byfriends end foes. After theevacuation

of Manaseas and all that section of Virginia by the Confederate army,

it was held by the Federals. For a time its beautiful residences

became hospitals and soldiers' quarters ; and its fields and gardens were laid waste. Then, again, Confederate successes drove the Northern forces from the neighbourhood. The whole of Fauquier County is now almost cleared of provisions, the lend has remained uncultivated, those of the inhabitants who could afford to seek other homes have long since done so, while the poor have been compelled to remain, and to suffer all the miserable privations of war.

Wsrrenton is sixteen miles west of the battle-ground of Bull Run, twenty-two from Centreville, end about twenty south of Leeeburg. It is situated on a high and varied range of hills, which, however, are low in comparison with its beautiful background of mountains. The principal residences are detached, and surrounded by trees and gardens. It has six or seven small churches, the handsomest of which is the Episcopal church, seen in the centre of our Engraving. To the right, the flag is waving from the cupola of the Courthouse, which is situated in the principal street of the town proper.

Warrenton has always supported excellent sohools, and boasted a large and handsome new college, where the education of young ladies was conducted by professors of acknowledged ability. -

To the left of the Engraving is the railroad, which terminatee about

100 yards beyond the little wooden bridge-one of those slight structures so moth more easily burned or destroyed than replaced in these tronblooe times.

Fauflier County has been distinguished for the refinement of its eociecy and for being the birthplace of many eminent Virginians. The late er-President Tyler, ex-Governor Smith, the Scatte, the Ashbye, and Captain Marr, the first victim of the present war, were nativee of this county.

Like most other American towns, Warrenton occupies a wide extent of land for the number of its inhabitants. The shanty andthe cornfield, with the decaying stumps of the ancient forest trees standing ameng the branching inaine, are found among villas andgardeo; and the whole country partakes of the -wildness of the mountain

In this rough, hilly country, where the roads at best maybe porn

pared to our broadest and wildest English lanes, and are so often impassable after heavy rains, the importance of a "plank-road'

is obvious. Where the long, heavy, parallel planks are planted firmly and closely on an even surface, a more permsnentlevel is secured than by any other means. Therefore was the plankroad between Fredericksburg and the County (Spotsylvania) Court-house an object of such contention in the late battles.

The quartermaster of the battalion in the fort immediately sprang forward, and seizing the fallen flag tore it from its hold and leapt on to the traverse, where he stood under the heavy fire immovable, until a jurymast was rigged and raised ore the place of the shattered staff. The soldiers in the foreground of my Sketch are removing the broken staff from the body of the poor fellow, who .lies beneath it, and who was the only moot killed be' the

The Richmond 1l,icrer gives full particulars of the circumstances

'ihilh led to the wounding of General Jackson. He had ridden, late

at might, on Saturday, the 2nd nit, in advance of the skirmishers, attended by his Staff and part of couriers. On returning, the cavalcade was mistaken for the enemy's cavalry and fired upon by a regiment-of his own corps. He was struokby three balls, one through the left xm, two inches below the shoulder-joint, shattering the bone and jevering the chief artery; another ball passed through the same arm, between the elbow and the wrist, making its exit through the palm of the hand; a third ball entered the palm of the right hand about its middle, passing through, and broke two bones. He fell from his horse and was caught by Captain Worinley, to whom he remarked, "All airy wounds. are by my own men." Several of Ins Staff and attendants were klled and wounded. The General was placed in a litter; but thering had attracted the attention of the enemy, who opened fire an their side. They shot down one of the litter-bearers, and the General tell from the shoulders of the men, receiving a severe contusion, adding to the injury of the arm and injuring his side severely. After amputation he complained of the effects of the fall from the litter. On Tuesday his 'wounds 'were doing so well that he inquired how -long he should be kept from the field.

MASTER WILLIE PAPE, THE AMERICAN

PIANIST.

Wrrn BenlczsMoRE FAME was born at Mobile,

Alabama, on the 27th of February, 1850. His

talent for music was noticed when only four years old. In 1854 his father commenced giving bier instruction, and such was his progress that he played at an exhibition of the new organ of St. John's Cathedral, in Mobile, one of Baoh's voluntaries, before an audience of over 2000 persons. In 1858 he was admitted a member of the Alabama Philbannonic Society, and up to January, 1881, he had the honour to be a soloist at every concert given by that society.

At this time his father was advised to place him

under some distinguished master in Europe, and for this purpose he left Mobile in January, 1858, and was about taking passage for England when the intelligence arrived, of the secession of Alabama from the Union. This determined his father to remain for a time in New York, until the result of this disunion sentiment should be own. In the meantime the b07 was placed under the tuition of Sebastian Bach Mills, a graduate of Leipsic, with whom he went through a course of classical study.

Master Papa appeared publicly in New York for the first time in May, 1861, in a course of soires at the Stuveysoent Institute, with Mdme. Anna Bishop, and astonished the public by his extraordinary execution and wonderful memory.

In July he made his first appearance at the Academy of Music, New York, playing pieces by Beethoven, Thalberg, and Liszt. In February, 1862, he accepted an engagement in Havannah, where he secured the patronage of the Captain-General, Count Serrano. Alter spending a few weeks in Havannah he returned to the United States, and was invited by the Philharmonic Society of Brooklyn to be their soloist at their concert of the 8th of May, at which he met with the most marked success, both from the audience and the press. Alter a short engagement in New York with Mdlle. Pat ti and other distinguished artists, he took a tour through Canada, making the acquaintance of the Governor-General, Lord Munok, and other noblemen and gentlemen, who took a kindly interest in the young pianist and gave him introductory letters to many influential personages in England.

A special correspondent of the New York- Times, writing from the Federal head-quarters near Vickabuxg, states that after some of the assaults on the place many of the wounded lay where they fell for

nearly four days, and that "the proportion of living to dead was

terribly emaIl," Few of those brou?lit off alive were likely to recover. In reference to the defences of Vicksburg, the same correspondent says

 Tim WAR flO VIRGINIA,

The report that General Leo had evacuated Fredericksburg and that Hooker had occupied the city was untrue. It appoars that, in consequence of the withdrawal of a Confederate brigade from Predeiioksburg, General Hooker sent a division across the Rappahannook at Deel) Run to reconnoitre. This division crossed in face of a heavy dre from the Confederate rifle-pits on the opposite shore, and, after capturing 100 Confederates in therifle-pits andasiertaining that Leaogstreet was there in force, crossed the river with the lose of forty men.

Onk.he 9th there was a Fevers cavalry engagement on the Rappa

]iencek. Lee had assembled a force of cavalry at Onipepper Courthouse for a raid into Maryland, and three brigades of Federal oavalry and 2000 infantry crossed the river at Beverley Ford to attack them.

A fight ensued, 'which lasted all day, when, heavy infantry reinforce-ments reaching the Confederates the Fedarals retired taking with thorn their dead end wounded. ha object of the expedition, to pre'vent the raid, is said to have been accomplished.

The .ZView Th* Times thus epitomises the great cavalry fight beyond

the Rappahsnnook

At daylight on Tuesday, the 0th, General Pleasa'oton crossed the Kappahassock in two columns, the right at Beverley's Ford and the left at Kelly's Ford, both fords being captured without much loss. Trio right column, commanded by BnBord, a mile from the river, canoe upon a brigade of Confederate cavalry just aroused from their sleep, when the fight commenced, and continued from five am, till three p.m., by which time the entire Confederate force, under general Stuart, consisting of 12,000 cavalry and 10 pieces of artillery, had been engaged, and driven back three miles on the right and five on the left with alight lees, the left column, under Gregg, having formed a junction with the right about two p.m. near Brandy Station. At three o'clock the fight was discontinued, the rebels having been driven back upon strong infantry supports, which were hurried up by rail from Ceilpepper, supposed to be a part of General Longstreet's force; and our forces returned almost unnoolcsteel to this ride of the river, The Confederate force proved to be more numerous than ours; but, notwithstanding this advantage, they were driven back with a'less of twenty and a stand of colours. Important papers were taken in the camps, by which it appears that General Stuart was to start on his great raid through the loyal States, passing through the Shenandoah Valley. This enterprise has new probably been postponed for a time.

 Several ylundering expeditions have been sent in different directions

by the Fe derals, and a great deal of property has been destroyed.

'various battles. The country represented on the map is about 200 p miles long by 110 broad, The battles fought thereon ranged, there- p

the Scattish border. The figures used, it wilL be soon, are of two characters, The larger denote twerity-four successive bettle-fields, of more or less importance; the smallermilicate the several occasions and the various routes by which the masterly marches of the late General Jackson to the rear of the Federal arming contributed. to defeat their purpose. It should she be wild thak, for the purpose

 of avoiding mmecossaxy detail and. consequent confusion, no towns have been denoted. upon our map save such as are of military or i stratooo importance. We shall now proceed to explain: the battlefields in detail, and. in their arithmetical, which will also be found to be their cluronological, order, 1. Yorktown (from April 6 to May 4, 186Z).-It was from this lpiut that the first noxious advance upon Richmond was niade. It will be remembered that when General M'Clolhm approached Richmond from Fort Monroe, with a~na

t7x4oof 158.000 man and a large fleet of gun-boate, the conied neral M'Gruder (now in Texas) throw a line of worts across from Yorktown to the James River, distance, about twelve miles. A portion of it, however, was composed of mffi-dams and avveraps. General Joseph Johnston arrived with his army from the Rappahannock in time to stop the gogress of the Federal General, who could otherwise have proceeded

I ally to Richmond, as MIGrador only had 6000 men under his earnmand. Upon General M'Clellan being reinforced by his iron- dad

boa-ts Johnston had to abandon his works, lest his suppliep, w reached him. by steamers, &a., on York River, should be out off. There were several sanguinary assaults upon Johnston's works; hub they failed, with considerable lose to thoFwlerds. Artillery duds ontinued for some forty days.

2. At Williamsburg (May 5, 1862) the Fedonds fall with force upon Johnston's rear as he retired towards Richmond. This 'action was very hotly contested, and resuitea iri Frost slaughter, the total killed and wounded reaching 6400, The Frost fought long and well; but they could not ourapeas impossibilities-the state of the roads and the heraig endurance of the Confederates baflling all their efforts.

 3. Barhomaville (May 7th).-Here General MIOIeU= next landed 20,000 man, supported by a fleet of vessels, intraiding to out off the rigarguard and waggon-train of Johnston, under command of General G. W. Smith, which must necessarily pass within two miles of this point. General Smith directed Brigaffier-General Whiting with 8000 men, to attack this force and drive them back to their boa;e. So un

Uhad an attack in the dense forests, where Texan rifles lurked

K= every Use, had its offbob~ and that trains passed in safety all that day.

4. "The Seven Pines" and "The Fair Oaks" (May 31 and June 1).-General Johnston, ban followed by M'Olellan across the Chiokahominy, turned upon and attacked him. The action ceasad after dark, General Johnston being severely wounded. The lationes

of the hour and the lose of General Johnston rendered the hard day,: struggle fruitless, although the Confederates hold the field. On the let Of June, 18G2, General Lee assumed the general oommand. of the Confederate forces.

5 and 6. Battles near Mechanicsville (June 26).-Gonoral Jackson at this time was near liechroYa River. General Lee, knowing that General M'Olellan had spies in Richmond, used them to mialewl him. He ordered General Whiting to take a division and proceed by niglit,

th d diapshoh, vi9L Lynchburg and Charlottesville, to

el onhoTs Rrv~enr (about 200 miles), and rop art to General Jackson.

While General M'Clellau wag tologrWhing to President Lincoln in Washington, and General Banks at thheater, to look out for Stonewall Jackson, who had been thus heavily minforoad and might threaten either place, Jackson was, by forced marches (sea I and arrows denoting his route), taking those very reinforcements back towards Richmond; and before M'Olellan suspected it he was in his re~ some miles norbh-eastof Mechanicsville.

19. On the night of Sept. 14 General Lee withdrew big men from outh Mountain, in consequence of General U401ellanhaTing obtained ossession. of Crampton's Gap, loading directly to Sharpsburg; and, roceedinR to the latter position, he t-here awaitod the coming of ackson. GenexulAl'Olellan followed him on Monday afternoon (16th),

and General Lee stood at bay for two days on the south-west bank of

Antietam, using his artilloryto delay M,CleUw!s %ttackuntilXackgon could join him. Jackson marohed all night afbar the capture of Harper's Ferry; andoxiWeduesday, the 17th, he fought a battle oxithe extreme left of the Confederate lines, which were more than four miles long,

General M'Olellan had three hose of battle; General Los was

scarcely able to present a single line, whirls 1 in some places, was not adequately supported. In addition to thin M'Cisllan had a large reserve, which was so admirably need that, when the Confederates at any point drove in the Federal lines, which they often did, the reserves overwhelmed them and compelled them to fell hack. The Federal signal corps contributed to this result, by giving immediate notice to M'Clellan of every event along the lines. In addition, there was great disparity of numbers between the contending forces. The action lasted from morning until dark. General A. P. Hill did not gsa into position until late in the afternoon, and his men wore weer'oed by their march from Rarpsr'e Ferry. General Lee, finding himself short of ammunition, forage, rations for the men, Go., and that M'Cleilan did not renew the notion on Thursday, crossed the Potomac that night. This movement was managed with such skill that the Confederate pickets did not know the army was gene until they were driven in after sunrise next morning.

 20. Shophordetown (September 20).-On Friday there was an artillery duel between the Confederate General Pondlston and M'Clsilan, across the Potomac River at Shepbsrdstown; but on the next day Jackson directed that a low brigades of M'Clellan'e army should be allowed to cross the river, and that General A. P. Hill should then attack them. It is impossible to estimate the immense numbers that were slaughtered or drowned on that occasion. The river was rod with blood and dieSgured with bodies for some distance. The total lees could not have been loss than 4000.

21. Pkoderichosborg (December 3)-This was the first occasion on which General Lee had the advantage of an extended line of works. He selected aonagniflcont plain about five miles long and from two to two and a half breed, and surrounded it with abattis, riflepits, and mesksd batteries, Into this plain the Federal army, under commend of General Burnsido ventured. Lungstrcet was on the left, Jackson and Stuart on he right. The hills around the plain were in the form of a crescent, and were each surmounted with batteries commanding the whole plain. Had General Lee been acquainted. with the extent of the Federal looses, he would have moved from his position and completed their destruction. As it was, he doily expected them to make another attempt to carry his works, and General Bornoido succeeded in withdrawing his army in the night across the river. The plan of the relative position of Lee and Barnsido's armies at Fredericksburg shows than so distiuotly as to prooludo the necessity of verbal description. The plain on which the battles were fought is, it will be sees, overlooked by the Stafford heights, on which batteries of guns of large size were placed, and in some noose shot and shell were sent five miles across the river and plain. There were few trees upon the plain, and consequently the movements of the Federal troops could be aeon from the hills.

 Stonewall Jackson had his hoart-qusrtere on a hill in roar of Hamilton's Crossing, end nearly 500 shot and shell fell that day within one hundred yards of whom he stood. At Mavye'e-hill the ground was covered for acres with killed and wounded Foderale lying in some places two or three deep. The orcos-street on this hill formed a fine stone bonastwork for the Confederates.

22. (Mao-oh 7, lS';l). A cavalry ongagemnnt between aiargobsdy of Federal cavalry (said to be 2500) and Brigadier-General Fit-c-Leo (a nephew of the lion. J. M. Mason). The losses were heavy', but the Federals n-crossed the itappahannook. General Los had only 750 men under his commend.

23. The Wilderness.-Geusmh Jackson, with a portion of his corps, pursued the source indioatsd by fig. ii and arrows, in order to tore the flank of General Hooker, whose army had crossed the river and was at Chanoollerevillo, and got between him and the fords and pontoons by which alone he could re-cress the river. Had it not been for his being wounded by his own men he would, in all probability, have compelled Hooker to surrender or fight his way hack to the river. Jackson had only 20,000 men in the action. In consequence of his wounds, the action defeated but did not destroy Hooker,

24. felarye's-bill.-Geueral flodgwiok, with 20,000 Federal troops (another statement makes it only 15, 000), having taken possession of the heights above Fredoriokoburg, and alsin, captured, or scattered the troops left in charge (aupposod to be Colonel llarkosdals's regiment)

was to turn attacked by a division of General Lee's army, and rontort with great slaughter.

In all the above engagements, and in ethers of lees importance, the Federal olSoers arid men fought with great snduraneo and bravery. as must be evident when the length of time they held their ground and their heavy losses are considered.

On the other hand, the victories of the Confederate leaders, hardly groused no they havo boon, havo failed often in bringing about those rsenltswhioh might fairly havo been expected from them.

11. August 8 and 9.-Jaokeee, whose line of march will be found denoted by the smaller figure 2 and arrows, here defeated Banks at Cedar Mountain (ales called "South-waet Mountain" and "Sleughter'eMountain "); lees about 2500.

13. Auguat 29 and l0.-,Tackeon here fought the second battle of Manaseee. The small fignre 2 and arrows show the entree Satan took to get in Pope's rear, Pope having fallen back to Warrenten. Jackson had marched day and night some fifty miles through Jefferson, Orleans, and Salem, meeting on the way and driving back to Alexandria the forces sent out to capture General Stuart. Re then took and deetroycl railroad traine and igoacce, cOerce that he found at lleneeeae; and, when Pope sent several dictions to surround him be met and fought them separately, holding them in check until Longetreet came up.
