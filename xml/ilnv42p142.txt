What Is Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?

Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of turning an image into computereditable text. An image is an electronic picture of text such as a scanned paper document or an electronic fax file. Images do not have editable text characters; they have many tiny dots (pixels) that together form a picture of text.

During OCR, OmniPage Pro analyzes an image and defines characters to produce editable text. This is also called recognizing text. After OCR, you can export the recognized text to a variety of word-processing, page layout, and spreadsheet applications.

Basic Steps of OmniPage Pro OCR

These are the basic steps of OmniPage Pro's OCR process:

1) Bring a document image into OmniPage Pro. You can scan a paper document or load an image file. The resulting image appears in the Image View.

2) Create zones to identify the parts of the document you want to recognize as text or retain as graphics. Zones are borders that enclose the parts of a document image that will get processed. You can create zones manually, automatically, or with a template. Any areas not enclosed by zones are ignored during OCR.

3) Perform OCR to convert image information into editable text characters. During OCR, OmniPage Pro defines text characters in an image. After OCR, you can check for and edit any errors.

4) Export the document to the desired location. You can save your document to a specified file format or place it on the Clipboard.
