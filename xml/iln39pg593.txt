<p>By the arrival of the screw-steamer Etna we have received New York journals of the 30th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OUTRAGE ON THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The journals of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, as a general rule, speak much more hesitatingly of the legality of Captain Wilks's act than they did a week previously. They condescend to contemplate the possibility of reclamations on the part of Great Britain, and of yielding thereto. The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says:-" If the British Government can be induced for the sake of reclaiming them" (Messrs. Mason and Slidell) "to take the highest American ground in favour of neutral maritime rights, we shall have sold them for a great deal more than they are worth." The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> acknowledges that the Northerners have hitherto been unjust to the British Government in complaining that it recognised the South as a belligerent Power. The President must soon take the same position.</p>

<p>It has transpired that no dispatches have been found in the trunks of the Ambassadors. The <hi rend="italics">New York Times</hi> remarks upon this unwelcome discovery :- "In that case the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of much of the reasoning employed in justification of the act of Captain Wilks may become nugatory."</p>

<p>The lawyers have begun to suspect that the Laurens and other cases have been misrepresented by Messrs. George Sumner and Everett, while the moneyed men still refuse to accept the assurances of the journals that it was "all right." It was feared, however, that the news of the turning of the Harvey Birch by the Nashville would again inflame the minds of the people against England.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS' RECEPTION IN BOSTON.</p>

<p>The Bostonians, usually so much more friendly than the New Yorkers, have on this occasion not acted in a manner worthy of their well-earned reputation. A public banquet at the Revere House was got up for the hero of the hour, and nothing could exceed the bad taste of the Massachusetts speakers (among whom were Judges Bigelow and Russell, Governor Andrew, and Mayor Rice), whether their insolent bombast was levelled at their two unfortunate captives or at the Government and people of a friendly nation.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>The Federals had taken possession of the island of Tybee, at the mouth of the Savannah River. The people of that city were flying panicstruck into the interior. The Confederates had blocked up the inlet leading to Savannah.</p>

<p>The Federals at Hilton Island found the place vary unhealthy, and were suffering much from fever and ague and congestive fever. All the teamsters and camp-followers were leaving for the North. The Federals have also occupied a post on St. Helena Sound, fifteen miles north of Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 19th ult. Colonel Brown opened fire from Fort Pickens on Pensacola, Florida. On the 24th the fight was still going on, we know not certainly with what result. The Southerners admit that the Navyyard was destroyed, with all its stores; that Pensacola had been evacuated; and that General Bragg had called for reinforcements. On the other hand, they claim to have driven off five vessels of war, to have riddled the Niagara with balls, and thoroughly disabled the Colorado. This is the Southern account; it will probably be another week before the Northern report reaches us.</p>

<p>The armies of the Potomac and the Upper Potomac were engaged in hutting themselves. It is still, however, strenuously denied that they are going into winter quarters.</p>

<p>The largest body of men ever reviewed on the American continent was passed in review by General M'Clellan, at Washington, on the 20th of November. The troops consisted of seventy-six regiments of infantry, seven of cavalry, and seventeen batteries, in all about 70,000 men.</p>

<p>Commerce in Missouri below St. Louis will be conducted by the Federal Government only.</p>

<p>The Fingal had run into Charleston with her valuable and timely cargo. On the other hand, the Federal ships have captured several vessels laden with contraband of war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE POLICY OF EMANCIPATION.</p>

<p>On this question Secretary Smith, a member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has expressed himself to the effect that the views of Mr. Cameron were not those of the Administration.</p>

<p rend="Center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Congress had passed a resolution for removing the seat of Government from Richmond to Nashville, Tennessee. Perhaps one reason for this step is the destruction of the costly bridges on the Virginia and Tenneessee Railroad, which imperils the connection between Richmond and the South-western States.</p>

<p>The Union men of North Carolina formally established a provisional State Government at Hatteras inlet on the 18th ult.</p>

<p>A portion of the people of Kentucky and Missouri have passed Secessionn ordinances.</p>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT DAVIS'S MESSAGE.</p>

<p>President Davis congratulates Congress on the progress of domestic manufactures among them. He speaks moderately of the great deeds of the Confederate army and of the high spirit of patriotism with which they are animated. He says:-
<p>A succession of glorious victories at Bethel, Bull Run, Manassas, Springfield Lexington, Leesburg, and Belmont, has checked the wicked invasion which greed of gain and the unhallowed lust of power brought upon our soil, and has proved that numbers cease to avail when directed against a people fighting for the sacred right of self-government and the privileges of freemen. After seven months of war the enemy have not only failed to extend their occupancy of our soil, but new States and territories have been added to our confederacy; while, instead of their threatened march of unchecked conquest, they have been driven at more than one point to assume the defensive, and, upon a fair comparison between the two belligerents as to men, military means, and fiancial condition the Confederate States are relatively much stronger now than when the struggle commenced.</p>

<p>After referring to the occurrences in Kentucky and Missouri, and, acknowleging that the postal service was entirely disarranged, he puts as good a face as possible on the condition of the Confederate treasury, which, however, is evidently driven to the extremity of issuing baseless promises to pay. By constructing forty miles of railroad between Danville in Virginia, and Queensborough, in North Carolina, a third through line of communication could be opened from North to South. He urgently advises Congress to give aid to the company organised for its construction and administration. He scoffs at the very idea of reconstructing the Union. "Our people now look with contemptuous astonishment on those with whom they have been so recently associated. They shrink with aversion from the bare idea of renewing such a connection :"-</p>
<p>When they see a President making war without the assent of Congress-when they behold Judges threatened because they maintain the writ of habeas corpus, so sacred to freemen-when they see justice and law trampled under the armed heel of military authority, and upright men insist and innocent women dragged to distant dungeons-when they find all this tolerated and applauded by a people who have been in the full enjoyment of freedom but a few mouths ago, they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility between such a people and themselves. With such a people we may be content to live at peace, but the separation is final, and for the independence we have asserted we will accept no alternative.</p>

<p>After denouncing the barbarous manner in which the United States have conducted the war, he accuses them of desiring to excite a servile war by the invasion of South Carolina, and warns them that in such a war they would forfeit all claims to be considered as prisoners of war. Of the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell he says.-

<p>The United States have thus claimed a general jurisdiction over the high seas, and, entering a British ship, sailing under its country's flag, violated the rights of embassy, for the most part held sacred, even more among barabrians, by seizing our Ministers whilst under the protection and within the dominions of a neutral nation.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were as much under the jurisdiction of the British Government upon that ship and beneath that flag as if they had been on its soil, and a claim  on the part of the United States to seize them in the streets of London would have been as well founded as that to apprehend them where they were taken. Had they been malefactors, and citizens even of the United States, they could not have been arrested on a British ship or on British soil unless under the express provisions of a treaty and according to the forms therein provided for the extradition of criminals. But rights the most sacred seem to have lost all respect in their eyes.</p>

<p>The close of Mr. Davis's Message is evidently levelled rather at Great Britain and France than at the body he professes to be addressing. On the subjects of the blockade and the growth of cotton he says:-

<p>Perhaps we had the right, if see had chosen to exercise it, to ask to know whether the principle, that blockades to be binding must be effectual, solemnly announced by the great Powers of Europe at Paris, is to be generally enforced or applied only to particular cases.</p>

<p>When the Confederate States, at your last session, became a party to the declaration reaffirming this principle of international law, which has been recognised so long by publicists and Governments, we certainly supposed it was to be universally enforced. The customary law of nations is made up of their practice rather than their declarationse, and if such declarations are only to be enforced in particular instances at the pleasure of those who make them, then the commerce of this world, so far from being placed under a general law, will become subject to the caprise of those who execute it or suspend it at will. If such is to be the course of nations in regard to this law, it is plain that it will thus become a rule for the weak and not for the strong.</p>

<p>Feeling that such views must be taken by the neutral nations of the earth, I have caused the evidence to be collected which proves comp letely the utter inefficiency of the proclaimed blockade of our coast, and shall direct it to be laid before such Government as shall afford us the means of being heard.</p>

<p>But, although we should be benefitted by this enforcement of this law, so solemnly declared by the great Powers of Europe, we are not dependent on that enforcement for this successful prosecution of the war. As long as hostilities continue the Confederate States will exhibit a steadily increasing capacity to furnish their troops with food, clothing, and arms. If they should be forced to forego many of the luxuries and some of the comforts of life, they will at least have the consolation of knowing that they are thus daily becoming more and more independent of the rest of the world. If, in this process, labour in the Confederate States should be gradually diverted from those great Southern staples which have given life to so much of the commerce of mankind into other channels, so as to make them rival producers instead of profitable customers, they will not be the only or even the chief losers by this change in the direction of their industry.</p>

<p>Although it is true that the cotton supply from the Southern states could only be totally cut off by the subversion of our social system, yet it is plain that a long continuance of this blockade might, by a diversion of labour and investment of capital in other employments, so diminish the supply as to bring ruin upon all those interests of foreign countries which are dependent on that staple.</p>

<p>For every labourer who is diverted from the culture of cotton in the South, perhaps four I times the number elsewhere, who found subsistence in the various employments growing out of its use, will be forced also to change their occupations.</p>

<p>While the war which is waged to take from us the right of self-government can never attain that end, it remains to be seen how far it may work a revolution in the industrial system of the world, which may carry suffering to other lands as well as to our own.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>

<p>On the San Jacinto outrage the <hi rend="italics">Quebec Chronicle</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Advertiser</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Spectator</hi> declare themselves in a sense hostile to the United States. It is said that there are only two Canadian newspapers which dissent from the general view.</p>

<p>Both the Imperial authorities and the people are preparing for the worst. The former have commenced the erection of new forts at Toronto, the latter are filling up the ranks of their volunteer regiments, and eagerly learning the rudiments of a soldier's profession.</p>

<p>Since the Canadian line of European Steamers have begun to start from the United States' port of Portland the passport system, inaugurated by Mr. Seward, is very troublesome to Canadian travellers. As no one but the Secretary of State is authorised to issue passports, much delay ensues, and many travellers have been forced to remain over for a week with or without their baggage. This conduct on the part of Mr. Seward causes much heartburning among the people who dwell on the north bank of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lord Monck was sworn in as Governor-General of Canada on the 28th ult.</p>

<p>The war in America has hitherto brought many advantages to the industrial interests of Canada. For the first time in history the St. Lawrence route has enjoyed a considerable share of the export trade of the Western States. As a consequence, Montreal has risen to be the second American seaport in the grain and provision business. The canal-boats, warehouses, and elevators on the St. Lawrence line are unable to transact the business which has so suddenly poured in upon them. Canadian imports from Europe have increased, while those of the United States have fallen off more than fifty per cent. The number of immigrants from Europe have increased from 9654 last year to 19,461 this year. The increase of immigrants from both Northern and Sontherns States is in still larger proportion. These American immigrants have established in Canada many small mannfactories. Probably, at least 50,000 souls have been added to the population of the province by immigration in 1861.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> latest intelligence from the United States, although not quite so unsatisfactory as that previously received, still leaves strong grounds for apprehension. There is no disguising the fact that most of the leading journals, and public opinion in that country generally, are against yielding to any demands that may be made by her Majesty's Government to restore the citizens of the Confederate States recently taken by force from the deck of a West India mail-packet carrying the English flag. Looking, at the same time, to the opinion and temper of the English people upon this subject, we see such sufficient cause for alarm that our attention is immediately drawn towards the position of the British colonies in North America, and particularly to the boundary line that separates them from the United States.</p>

<p>It would be useless now to discuss the question as to how the frontier line of Canada and New Brunswick has become what it is, or whether it might not have been, by more judicious management, better than we now find it; but it is certain that the boundary line of the States of Maine and New York does so cut into the British territory that United States' armies may encamp within exceedingly short distance of our principal cities and yet be on their own soil.</p>

<p>Newfoundland being an island, and Nova Scotia nearly one, we may safely calculate on our naval supremacy ensuring them protection from molestation; but with the important province of New Brunswick, the Canadas, and the British North-west Territory, our position is by no means so satisfactory, as in many instances in these latter provinces there is no physical boundary whatever, the British possessions and those of the United States being separated by little more than an imaginary line. The trees have been cut down where it passes through the wilderness, and a few stones have been set up at long distances apart, and that is the only division that marks the territories of two peoples who, though coming of a common stock, speaking the same language, and worshipping God in the same manner, yet are intent only on doing each other the largest possible amount of mischief. There is yet hope that it may not be so, but the threatening aspect of affairs compels us to look narrowly at our position on the frontier.</p>

<p>The city of Quebec, our great stronghold in North America, is only sixty miles from the United States' territory; and River de Loup, the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, and of the Canadian sytem of railways generally, although 120 miles lower down the St. Lawrence, is within thirty miles of the international boundary line.</p>

<p>Montreal, the capital of the Canadas, is only forty-four miles by railway from Rouse's Point at the head of Lake Champlain-a point where the States of New York and Vermont meet. Several of the United States' railways focus to this place, and it will become an important position should war break out: it was so in 1841, a great battle being fought in this neighbourhood, the victory being claimed by the Americans.</p>

<p>From Rouse's Point for neary 300 miles eastward are what are called the eastern townships of Canada-districts containing many important towns and much cleared and cultivated land; these abut upon the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, without any marked physical boundary, the St. Lawrence lying on their northern or western edge. West of Montreal, nearly opposite the Canadian town of Cornwall, the boundary line of the United States hits the St. Lawrence, and the river then separates them from Canada until it receives its waters at the outlet from Lake Ontario, many good towns lying on each side of it. On the Canadian banks the principal are Cornwall, Morrisburg, Prescott, and Kingston; on the United States' side the principle town is Ogdenburg, exactly opposite Prescott.  These latter are large and important places, situated pretty much as Gravesend and Tilbury Fort are; both are important railway termini. Prescott is the point of junction of the Giant Trunk Railway with the line to Ottawa, the intended seat of the Government of Canada; while Ogdensburg is connected by railway with Rouse's Point to the eastward and with the New York Central Railway to the southward and westward. Kingston, in Canada, is situated at the point where Lake Ontario pours its waters into the St. Lawrence through a thousand channels formed by a number of beautiful islands. Kingston is a fortified place, and adjoins Fort Henry, a military position second only in importance to Quebec. Fort Henry is built on the site of the old French Fort Frontenac. In a war with the United States this place would become most important as a d&eacute:p&ocirc:t for troops, as well as a naval station, where craft would be built to act upon Lake Ontario and the upper waters of the St. Lawrence. On the north shore of Lake Ontario is situated the large, rich, and flourishing city of Toronto, the capital of Western Canada. It is built close upon the waters edge, is utterly unprotected by art, but nature his done much for it. It is a peculiar characteristic of Lake Ontario to have formed in particular situations long banks of sand and shingle, locally called beaches. At a considerable distance from the shore, in front of the city, is a long narrow bank of this description, upon which batteries could be formed with rapidity, that would effectually protect this important city from all attacks on the lake side, while direct railway communication with Fort Henry would secure it landwards. Toronto, therefore, though apparently so exposed, may be safely expected to take care of itself when the time arrives for its doing so. At the western end of Lake Ontario is situated another large and important city, Hamilton, and protected from all attacks from the lake by a beach similar to that which lies in front of Toronto. A single vessel sunk in the canal which connects the waters of Burlington Bay (on the south shore of which Hamilton is situated) with those of Lake Ontario render it impossible for any vessel to approach within three or four miles of Hamilton. Its dangers, therefore, must be sought for in the oppsitosite direction.</p>

<p>On the south shore of Lake Ontario there are situated several important United States' towns; and between the mouth of the Niagara River and the point where the lake becomes the River St. Lawrence are no lees than six railway termini to lines which are connected with the New York central line. In the Genesee, at Oswego, and Sackett's harbour, in the event of hostilities, armaments would be fitted out to operate upon the opposite shore, in which case Lake Ontario would again become the scene of remarkable naval exploits. Across the lake, nearly opposite to Toronto, and within sight of it on a fine day, upon a high hill, stands the monument recently erected to General Brock, who fell there, after having gained a victory over the American troops.</p>

<p>The international boundary line, having passed up the centre of Lake Ontario to opposite this point, turns suddenly inwards and then follows, the centre of the deep river which enters the lake here, pouring out in one unbroken mass the accumulated surplus waters of the great Lake Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, white and foamy after the great leap they have made at Niagara, only a few miles higher up the stream. The Niagara River is a secure barrier for either nation. It may be crossed at its mouth, it is true, but not with impunity if an enemy occupied the precipitous hills on either side. At the foot of the Great Falls it may also be crossed, but a thousand men having done so could not land if fifty occupying the heights chose to prevent them. A magnificent bridge spans the terrible rush of waters down the gorge of the Niagara- a triumph of engineering skill which the arts of peace have produced, and which, doubtless, the art of war will destroy.</p>

<p>Above the Falls of Niagara the boundary line keeps the centre of the stream until it enters Lake Erie. The north shore of this lake is British, and centains some of the best districts of Western Canada. On the American side is the large city of Buffalo; also, Dunkirk, Erie, Cleveland, and Sandusky, the whole of which are railway termini.</p>

<p>The international boundary line is up the centre of Like Erie and through the River St. Clair and Lake St. Clair into Lake Huron. Between Lakes Huron and Erie the United States and British territory is divided only by a fine navigable river, much like the Thames at Erith; the large American city of Detroit is situated on its west bank and the Canadian town of Windsor opposite to it. The latter is the western terminus of the Great Western Railway of Canada; the former the focus of a system of railways. From the upper end of the River St. Clair, the boundary line divides equally the waters of Lake Huron, and enters Lake Superior through the St. Marie. The larger portion of this lake belongs to the Americans. From its northern shore the line follows the direction of the water communications until it reaches the parallel of 49&deg: north latitude, along which it is continued across the Rocky Mountains until it reaches the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>On the north side of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, adjoining the State of Minnesota, there exists a very valuable country known as the North-west Territory. Although in the occupation of the Hudson Bay Company, it is a tract of exceedingly fine land, and contains some settlements known as the Red River or Selkirk settlements. This is a far-off, outlying property of the British Crown, exceedingly valuable to us, and much coveted by the United States, it has been sadly neglected by its owners, and we may soon find it the most difficult to protect.</p>

Subsequently he joined the West India mail service as a junior officer, and at the time of the Russian War he was chief officer of the Royal mail steam-packet Orinoco when that vessel was engaged in towing the disabled men-of-war from the thickest of the fight. Soon after the war he was appointed commander of the Royal mail steam-packet Teviot, then to the Conway, and finally to the Trent, which he now commands. On several occasions he has had to take the command of the Atrato and La Plata in the Transatlantic service, and the passengers by those, as well as the intercolonial ships which he has commanded, cannot fail to remember the strict attention paid to their comfort, the scrupulous neatness and cleanliness of the ship, the excellent discipline of the crew, and courteous and gentlemanlike demeanour of the Captain, of whom the worst that can be said is, that he is a good officer and a thorough gentleman.</p>

Meantime journalists can but speculate and express the united feeling of the nation that we must uphold the honour of the English flag, but that we trust the good sense of the respectable classes in America will dominate over the passionate mob and spare us the terrible necessity of striking a blow. From the French papers we cull little save the expression of French opinion upon the outrage for which we have demanded redress, and it is satisfactory to see that the logical minds of the Parisian journalists, when permitted fair play, at once lead them to the conclusion that England had but one course open to her. Deeply interesting as would be at any other time the debates in the Italian Parliament and the situation of Baron Ricasoli and his Ministry, the fiery elegance or languid pedantry of the speakers is little heeded, nor can much indignation be spared for the atrocious cruelties which, if accounts be true, are being perpetrated upon the unfortunate Poles, in punishment for their recent demonstrations of love of country. All this negligence of all but one subject should be noted across the Atlantic, for it is a grim proof how thoroughly England-once aroused-shows herself in earnest.</p>

<p="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>In consequence of the possibility of a rupture between this country and the Federol States of North America the war authorities have exerted themselves with extraordinary vigour to send reinforcements promptly to Canada. The <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> tells us that by to-day (Saturday) 2200 additional troops will be on their way to Canada. This will bring up the strength of the regular forces in the colony to between 7000 and 8000, and we have at home a reserve which, if the necessity should be forced upon us, would enable up to bring 30,000 highly disciplined men at once into the field. At all the dockyards the greatest activity prevails in getting ships of war ready for sea-the number destined for service on the West India and North American station being roughly estimated at about sixty.</p>

<p>Yesterday week the officers, non-commissioned officers, gunners, and drivers, comprising Captain Vesey's E battery of the 4th brigade Royal Field Artillery, assembled on parade at Woolwich, and after inspection proceeded in marching order from the garrison to the Royal Arsenal, for embarkation on board the screw steam-vessel Melbourne, for Canada. The streets in the line of march were crowded with spectators, and the force, which was preceded by the full band of the regiment and numerous field officers, was repeatedly cheered by the public, and especially on entering the main gate of the Royal Arsenal, where a multitude had assembled. The force immediately embarked from the Royal Arsenal jetty on board the Melbourne, which has shipped during the week the following amount of war stores-viz., two complete batteries of Armstrong guns, several howitzers, 30,000 stand of arms and accoutrements, 2,500,000 rounds of Mini&eacute: rifle balls and smallarms ammunition, 1500 rounds of Armstrong-gun ammunition, cartridges, &c. She also takes out military clothing and a quantity of stores peculiarly adapted for Canada, including a number of snow-sleighs, which the wheelers and carpenters of the Royal carriage department were working day and night to manufacture during the week. The Melbourne was under orders to sail in the evening, but an order was received to increase by a large number the supply of sleighs for the transport of guns, &c., and an additional number of workmen were consequently employed during the night. The embarkation scene is depicted on p607, and on page 612 we give an Engraving of one of the sleighs for the transport of guns. The Melbourne sailed on Saturday at half-past two p.m. The long and spacious platform of the Royal Arsenal Pier was thronged during the process of getting under way by officers of the garrison and their families. As soon as the ship had veered round from her moorings and was fairly on her course the spectators gave a hearty "God speed!" which was immediately followed by the waving of caps and handkerchiefs and shouts of applause. The shouts then commenced on board, and were repeatedly heard when the Melbourne was far down the Thames, testifying in a perfectly unmistakable manner to the feelings of the troops. Besides the ordinary warm clothing which was sent out in the Melbourne, each man will be provided with the following articles :-A fur (sealskin) cap, two flannel waistcoats, a pair of fur gloves, six pair of Canada boots, two pair of woollen stockings, a comforter, and a chamois leather jacket. Sonic 3000 moccasins and snowshoes will also be sent as soon as they can be procured. The 30,000 Enfield rifles conveyed by the Melbourne are intended for the Canadian militia. This excellent force, numbering now some 30,000, and capable of being increased to 200,000, was organised during the Crimean War. The volunteer movement has also taken deep root in Canada, and as almost every village contains an old military officer, their drilling and organisation have been well looked after.</p>

<p>Other ships will speedily follow the Melbourne with similar freights. In addition to the Persia and Australasian, each of which will take out about 1200 men, the Government have decided upon chartering six large steamers for the purpose of carrying troops and stores to Jamaica, Bermuda, and Halifax. The Persia and Australasian are being rapidly fitted for the conveyance of troops, stores, and ammunition, and it is expected they will be ready to sail about the 14th or 15th inst. Each of them is to carry out a complement of 1100 soldiers, 5000 stand of arms, and 300 tons of stores. Besides these each is to take out a field battery and a large quantity of ammunition.</p>

<p>It has been determined to send out a considerable number of non-commissioned officers to assist in the organisation of the Canadian militia-cach regiment at Aldershott having been called to furnish three volunteers for this duty. It is stated that in some regiments as many as thirty sergeants have volunteered.</p>

<p>Colonel Napier, Deputy Quartermaster-General in Canada, is placed on the Staff in that colony, with the rank of Major-General. He is succeed as the Deputy Quartermaster-Genera1 by Colonel Mackenzie, C.B., who was on the China Staff. Colonel Lysons will be the Adjutant-General of Militia for the colony.</p>

<p>On Sunday week a large number of mechanics and labourers were employed at the Tower of London in packing firearms and every kind of article which is required for active service. Another order was received on Saturday last to prepare 25,000 more rifles, which were duly packed and conveyed in barges to the Government d&eacute:p&ocirc:t at Woolwich, where they were placed on board the several vessels which are about to depart for Canada. The large gunmakers at the east end of London are working night and day to execute large numbers of rifles, and each contractor has to supply a certain number daily, which are tested at the proofhouse and then sent to the Tower for exportation.</p>

<p>On Monday the fleet battalion of the Grenadier Gaurds were inspected at the Tower previous to their embarkation for Canada. This whole of the men have undergone medical examination, and those found infit for active service have been rejected.</p>

<p>By order of the Lords of this Admiralty, Commodore Nicolson, of H.M.S. Fisgard, the guardship for the port of London, has issued notice that all members of the Royal Navy temporarily borne on the books of the Fisgard from ships that have been paid off, and who have been granted one month's leave of absence, are to rejoin immediately. Similar orders have been sent to all the outports, and all leave of absence is for the present suspended in the Royal Navy. The entry of able and ordinary seamen for her Majesty's service is being vigorously prosecuted, and the Royal Naval Rendezvous, Towerhill, which has been closed for some months, is to be reopened to receive men desirous of joining the service. From the returns recently made by Captain Brown, principal registrar of the Reserve of Naval Volunteers, it appears that the tootal strength of the corps ic 7646 men. 180 of the number holding certificates of competency as masters and mates, and 1050 being competent to act as petty officers-all of whom are ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The total number of men available in our naval reserve is estimated by the <hi rend="italics">United Service Gazette</hi> at 21,231. The following is a detail of the several reserves on the lst instant:-Coastguard on ships' books for shore duty, 232 officers, 3386 men-3618. Ships' crews, 227 officers, 1763 men, and 719 boys-2709. Tenders' crews, 107 officers, 574 men, and 166 boys-847; marines, 510. Total, 7174. Old reserve force: 26 officers, 1108 men. Naval coast volunteers, 7768. Naval reserve force, 7440.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at various military stations in Ireland for completing the strength of sixty-nine regiments of the Line. Recruiting for that purpose will commence immediately.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> says that we could quadruple the force now and about to be under Admiral Milne, on the North American station, without any apparent effort. We could, besides heavy line-of-battle ships, frigates, corvettes, sloops, and gun vessels, spread over the seaboard of the Northern States no less than fifty screw gun-boats, each armed with heavy Armstrongs (they are all ready), to be followed by another hatch of fifty, if the first required support. The total force which we could place under Sir Alexander's orders wherewith he could open the ball would be, supposing the Mediterranean fleet furnished its quota, eleven line-of-battle ships, mounting 975 guns, manned by 9580 men; ten frigates, mounting 447 guns, manned by 5150 men; five heavy corvettes, mounting 105 guns, manned by 1360 men; and seventeen sloops and smaller vessels, mounting together 93 guns, manned by 1493 men; making a grand total of 1527 guns, end 12,436 men. In addition to the men now mentioned, the Donegal, Conqueror, and Sanspareil have on board a battalion of marines in the highest state of discipline.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> of Wednesday has a brief leader to the following effect:-Various statements, all more or 1ess inaccurate, having been made respecting the reinforcements for the protection of our interests in North America, it may be well to mention the steps actually taken for that purpose. The following troops have been ordered to Canada in the Persia,tho Australasian, and the Melbourne, of which the Melbourne has sailed:- Two battalions of infantry of the Line, two batteries of Field Artillery, one company of Royal Engineers. And we understand that arrangements are being made for forwarding to British North America at once two battalions of Guards, four battalions of infantry of the Line, three batteries of Field Artillery, five batteries of Garrison Artillery, two battalions of Military Train, and two companies of Royal Engineers. The two battalions of the Guards under orders are the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards, now at the Tower, and the second battalion Scots Fusilier Guards, at Wellington Barracks. The Rifle Brigade and first battalion of the l6th are in course of embarkation, and the following battalions are held in readiness- viz., the first of the 15th, 96th, and second of the 16th Regiments.</p>
