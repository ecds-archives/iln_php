<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">REVIOUS</hi> Numbers of this Journal have contained some particulars of the unsuccessful attempt of Stone's and Bank's columns to effect a landing on the 21st ult, on the Virginian Shore of the Upper Potomac, near Leesburg; and we now give two Illustrations, from Sketches by our Special Artist, in connection with this seemingly mad enterprise on the part of the Federal forces. The whole affair appears to have been ill-planned and adds another to the grievous blunders committed by the Federal commanders. It is hardly credible that 1800 men should have been sent across a river in the face of an enemy most strongly posted, and left unsupported when 30,000 of the division to which they belonged were within sound of their rifles. The small body, however, fought gallantly throughout the day against three times their number. One incident of the fight-a desperate effort made by the 15th Massachusetts Regiment to clear the woods by a bayonet charge-is Illustrated on our first page. This is believed to be the only instance in which a bayonet charge has been attempted by a regiment in the Federal army. The 15th Massachusetts fought most gallantly throughout the whole affair, although they knew the odds to be greatly against them; and the example set by their officers, mostly students from Harvard College, Cambridge, was most praiseworthy. Their efforts, however, were not crowned with success, as the deadly fire of the Mississippi riflemen drove them back each time; and, as evening drew on, seeing the utter uselessness of contending against their powerful enemy, the few surviving combatants slowly fell back to the river-side with but two line officers remaining. In the endeavour to recross to the island, midway between the Maryland and Virginian shoress, from which they had started, the general organisation of the force was quite abandoned, each company acting separately. The officers and men who could swim started, half naked, over the river, and the boats were kept awhile for the wounded. This, however lasted but a little time. All order was quickly lost. A large flat boat was sunk by overcrowding, and scores of men perished, some by drowning and some by the fire of the Confederates, who now crowded the high bank and poured an incessant fire upon the scattering fugitives. The river channel was thickly strewed with the dead and dying, but the bearing of the survivors is reported to have been strangely quiet-the immobility, perhaps of desperate hopelessness. Hundreds, probably, were here sacrificed. This much is certain, that out of the 1800 who landed scarcely 600 returned. The retreat of the Federalists forms the subject of the accompanying Engraving.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 23, 1861.</p>

<p>T<hi redn="smallcaps">HE</hi> fearful storms which have raged on the eastern coast of North America have acquired a strange and almost ghastly interest for the North and South. The magnificently-described Armada that had sailed to deal the accumulated vengeance of the Federalists upon the Confederates had, it was thought, steered into the very heart of the tempest. The most opposite passions were aroused, and while the Northerners were praying that the armament to which the honour of the Union had been so solemnly confided might escape the fury of the elements the fiercer prayers of the South went up for its destruction- a result which the terrible character of the storms made painfully probable. We are told that it is almost certain that the fleet has been preserved; and we may hear at once that it has not only been saved, but has delivered its blow at Charleston or elsewhere. Meantime affairs on land have assumed a perplexing, not to say menacing, character. It was finally decided to remove General Fremont from his command, and the order came suddenly down to his camp, together with the journals which made the fact public. A mutiny of the gravest kind instantly showed itself. We say of the gravest kind, because the principal actors were not from the rank and file, but were officers, whose first duty was subordination, and who set the fatal example of declaring that they would not serve except under the General whose somewhat melodramatic faults seem to have endeared him to the forces lately under his command. General Fremont himself had to appeal to their sense of duty to the Republic; and it would appear that a sullen acquiescence was obtained, and that they will condescend to fight under the new leader appointed by the authorities. This may all augur ill for operations in that quarter. An American writer who has been narrowly inspecting the army of the North draws so unfavourable a picture of its discipline, cleanliness, and soldierly bearing as makes the English reports appear almost complimentary. But, in the face of all, Secretary Cameron announces to the nation that the day of reverses is over, and that the Union is now about to proceed from triumph to triumph. More to the purpose, it is distinctly stated that not only is the abolition of Southern slavery entirety out of the plans of the North, but that slaves who may be used by the army of the Federalists shall, if they belong to loyal owners, be paid for just as if they had been mules or any other article required for the campaign. This may be regarded as a provisional olive-branch held out to smooth matters in the event of a Northern success making a compromise possible. The Abolition party are enraged beyond measure, and their demonstrations are formidable. Meantime the usual raving of the ribald press is launched against England; and we are told that ours is a "Puritan and blackleg Cabinet," that the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> is the accepted organ of the English Tories (which may be news to our contemporary), and that as soon as ever the war is over " such a train of disasters" shall be inflicted upon England as shall make her rue the day when she dared to say that ten millions of Americans were belligerents instead of rebels. It is impossible to believe that such rabid rant and utter nonsense can have weight with educated Americans; but why is it tolerated by authorities that have and use power to suppress a journal for only expressing a wish for peace?...</p>
<p>The Americans, who profess themselves so enchanted at the sympathies of the Czar, and who half menace us and France with a Russo-American crusade, will have some few sacrifices to make in the matter of civilisation when the proposed coalition takes place. They open private letters, imprison suspected persons, put down journals, and clamour for hanging spies, but they have not attained the point of tying up women and flogging them for Southern proclivities, though, if it be true, as stated, that "the ladies of the North are all for the Southrons," there is no saying what the New York press may not recommend as "vigour of action."</p>

<p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">EW</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">DELPHI</hi>.-The long-announced production or "The Octoroon," the new sensation drama by Mr. Boucicault, took place on Monday before a crowded audience which filled the house to the ceiling. The scene is in Louisiana, where the Octoroon, or "eighth blood," is not allowed by law to marry with a white person; and the interest of the plot is based on this circumstance. Zoe, the natural daughter of Judge Peyton, has been reared in luxury but not fully emancipated, and on the death of her father is exposed to the machinations of a rascally overseer, Jacob M'Closkey (Mr. Emery), who, having mismanaged the estate, has an interest in forcing on its sale, with the slaves belonging to it, that he may purchase Zoe, and subdue her to his unwelcome passion. George Peyton, the nephew of the Judge and heir to the property (Mr. Billington), seeks naturally to avoid the sale, and expects daily a remittance from Liverpool sufficient to satisfy all demands. M'Closkey takes measures to prevent the packet from reaching his hands in time, in consequence of which the slaves are sold. A slave auction accordingly forms the grand sensation scene of the drama, which is conducted with all the formalities accompanying such transactions in Southern America, and forms a most exciting tableau. M'Closkey outbids all intending purchasers for the fair Octoroon, and  becomes her possessor. But, in his attempt to retard the delivery of the letter to Peyton, he has incurred a guilt for which he is destined to punishment. He has murdered a negro lad who was in charge of the post-bag; and a picture of the act has been accidentally taken by a photographic machine which was being worked in the vicinity. He falls into the clutches of Lyncn law, and is confined on board a steamer pending his execution. To effect his escape he hurls a lantern among some tar-barrels, and thus causes an explosion. But an avenging Indian is on his track, and slays him on the grave of the poor negro whom he had murdered. And all might now be well, but that Zoe, ignorant of these facts, has taken poison in despair. The drama is placed on the stage with all the accessories that can conduce to a great and marked success, and is illustrated with local scenery of great beauty. The composition itself is distinguished by a lightness and elegance of touch which compensates for whatever is revolting in the action. The whole was capitally performed. Mr. Emery was remarkably impressive in M'Closkey, and Mr. Boucicault as tim Yankee overseer, who afterwards turns photographer, was characteristically made up, and sustained his part with great humour. Mrs. Boucicault, as the heroine, excited so much interest that the audience were scarcely reconciled to her failing a victim in order to point more effectually the moral of the drama. We certainly recognise no aesthetic necessity for such a d&Eacute:nouement, but rather the contrary, and think that the author would have found his account in a happier ending. Mr. Billington, as the hero, was pathetic and gentlemenly; and the other parts were well supported, particularly that of an old negro, by Mr. George Jamison, and that of the Indian, by Mr. Phillips. The female parts, also, were well filled by Mrs. Marston and Miss Latimer. Miss Clara Denvil, as the poor murdered negro-lad, acted with her usual grace and spirit The success of the piece was decided.</p>

Captain Nelson, of the Harvey Birch, reports having left havre on Saturday last, the 17th inst., bound for New York, in ballast. On the 19th inst., when in lat. 42 deg. 6 min. N., long. 9 deg. 52 min. W., she was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagrim, late of the United States' navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who at once ordered the captain and crew on board the steamer, allowing them to take a few of their effects and fresh provisions. Captain Peagrim then ordered the Harvey Birch to be fired, and laid alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge. Captain Nelson is just landed with his crew and officers, twenty-nine in all, and has immediattely placed himself in communication with Captain Britton, the United States' Consul at this port. The Nashville is still lying in the river, flying the Southern Confederate flag. Captain Nelson says that Commander Peagrim states he has no commission from the Southern Government as a war-steamer, and yet declares he is not a privateer. No Southern Commissioners have arrived by the Nashville. There are, however, on board a Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton appears to have some commission to execute, as he proceeds to London immediately. The Nashville has experienced very bad weather since running the blockade at Charleston. Her crew consists of English and Irish, who, after shipment, were compelled to sign other articles. The whole of the crew of the Harvey Birch, with the exception of Captain Nelson and his two officers, were placed in irons until arriving here. Captain Peagrim endeavoured to make Captain Nelson and his crew take an oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government. Captain Peagrim has communicated with Mr. Yancey."</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has become a question whether there is any design in both or either of the contending parties in the States of America to obtain from Great Britain, in a certain sense involuntarily,that which would amount to a violation of neutrality. It is well known that there has been, and probably there still is, an irritability among the more sensitive spirits of the Federal States against England on account of the decided principles of non-intervention in this terrible quarrel which have been laid down by our statesmen and universally acquiesced in by our people. What was expected of this country in such a juncture of American affairs as now exists does not very clearly appear; but of the fact that dissatisfaction with the conduct of England prevails to a considerable extent in the Northern States there is no doubt. Of the feeling towards this country in the Southern States we have little or no knowledge; but there have been rumours, the effect of which is that the Confederates believe that, in our secret hearts, our leaning is to

</p><pb n="536">
their Side, and that our sympathies are, so to speak, wrapped up in cotton. So much of our prosperity, and of the welfare of a large part of our population, is supposed, not without reason, to depend on our import of an article of which in our markets the South has hitherto enjoyed a practical monopoly, that it has been whispered that the Confederate leaders had determined not to allow the export of any cotton to this country under any circumstances, and even apart from the restriction of a blockade, in the hope that England would yield to a commercial pressure, which might easily be converted into a social disturbance, and take such steps as would in effect cause her to do something more than lean to the party of the Secessionists. It would scarcely be denied, even in America itself-certainly not in the Southern States-that even a show of partisanship on the part of England would throw a heavy weight into the scale against the party which she discountenanced; and, however any such idea may be disavowed, it is more than probable that either section would be glad to test the real feeling of this country and the absolute soundness of the neutrality which she professes. Circumstances have just occurred which, as we conceive, will tend to bring about a settlement of any doubts which may exist in regard to this question. Far be it from us to insinuate anything which can be construed into even a tendency to offence to either party in this unhappy contest, but we may be permitted to say that it has long been the boast of the Americans as a people that they are essentially what they call "smart;" and, among other additions to the language which is common to the Old and the New Country which they have succeeded in making is the word "dodge"-the significancy of which is admitted. Of course, the word could not exist unless that which it signifies also existed; and that its application should creep into the conduct of the public affairs of the States, Federal or Confederate, at a critical moment, and when a great object was at stake, would not be in the least surprising.</p>

<p>These remarks have been elicited by the fact that armed vessels, both of the Federal and Confederate States, have made their appearance at one of our principal ports, and have demanded that aid, in the shape of opportunities and facilities for refitting, which, by the permission of the Sovereign, any State is accustomed to afford to the war-vessels of all nations. In the cave of the Federal vessel, whatever may have been her objects or her destination, she bore with her no distinctive marks of those qualities which would have brought her within the terms of the declaration of neutrality which has been solemnly enuticiated to the contending parties in America by the Government of this country. In that declaration it is laid down that her Majesty and all her subjects will "hold a strict and impartial neutrality between the Government of the United States of America and certain States styling themselves the Confederate States of America." The subjects of this realm are warned against adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties; and an interdict has been laid on the armed ships, and also the privateers of both parties, from carrying prizes made by them into the ports of the United Kingdom or of any of her Majesty's possessions. Sinning overtly against none of these provisions, the James Adger-Federalist-got what she required at Southampton, and in due time departed from that port, whither and for what immediate purposes we were bound by the letter of international law not too curiously to inquire. Hardly had the Federal flag disappeared from our waters when the Confederate colours floated in the same harbour, also over an armed ship, coming, avowedly, for the purpose of refitting. But here the parallel ceases. Without any attempt at disguise, but, as far as we can judge, with ostentatious frankness, it is made known by the commander of the Nashville that almost, if not entirely, in British waters, he had captured and burnt a trading vessel belonging to adherents of the Federal party, made prisoners of the crew, and brought them to England in irons; this latter course having been taken because they declined to enter the Confederate service.</p>
<p>So much of the well-known facts connected with the Nashville it has been necessary to state in order to justify the supposition which we venture to lay down, that the whole proceeding, from first to last, was carried on with the design of bringing to the test the question of British neutrality. It would seem as if this merchantman in ballast was taken and destroyed by a Confederate ship of war with the object of exhibiting the character of the latter openly before the eyes of the English Government, and coming, as it were, red-handed, from the destruction of a Federal vessel, she enters an English port, and asks aid and assistance in rendering her complete and efficient, and enabled to proceed on a cruise in which, of course she expects to meet with other vessels belonging to her enemies and to deal with them in the same manner as she treated the Harvey Birch. It is true that she brought no prize into a British port; but she brought with her all the symbols and signs of a prize. Indeed, she retains property on board of her belonging to the captain and passengers of the captured, for the recovery of which these latter have endeavoured to invoke the help of English law. Can it be denied that, if permission were given to the Nashville to refit and repair, it would be a violation of the spirit, if not of the letter-and even this distinction is by no means clear-of that part of the Queen's declaration which forbids "the adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties?" No doubt the technical answer to this assertion is, that these words apply only to matters which are called contraband of war. But the real question is, how would such an act as the aiding and comforting-to use an old legal word- of this Confederate vessel, fresh from the capture of a Federal vessel, he construed by the authorities and the people of the North; and, if the truth were known, does not the Captain of the Nashville know that it would be construed in a hostile sense; and is not that the very reason why he has brought his ship, with the crew of her prize, into Southampton harbour?</p>

<p>Something might be said of the "prononc&eacute:" manner in which a Confederate agent who has come to England in the Nashville-of whom and of his mission we say nothing-has talked of the vast quantities of cotton which are lying ready for shipment in the Southern States, and which, of course, only await some contingency which would break up or render ineffective the Federal blockade. This matter, small in itself, is sufficiently suggestive, and is not without significance in arguing the view we have taken in reference to this transaction.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that we are discussing this question, not in any spirit of partisanship or with any tendency of feeling or opinion towards either party in the United States, but solely, as it stands, as a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the Government of this country in carrying out that principle of neutrality which has been laid down as our rule of action. In that sense, and considering the question only from that point of view in coming to a conclusion, it seems to us that the observance of pure and unadulterated neutrality demands that no assistance should be given to the Nashville. Admitting that all which we have suggested of a crafty device having been adopted in order to embroil this country with the Federal Government to be without foundation, and indeed we did not for a moment mean to insinuate that it should enter into the consideration of the Government in practically dealing with the matter, on the true construction of our declaration of rigid non-intervention, and, still more, on the principle of sound policy, the usual accommodation and appliances which are granted to ships of war in our ports ought to be withheld from this Confederate vessel of war presenting herself under her peculiar circumstances to the notice of the English authorities.</p>

<p>We have waited in vain up to the moment at which we are writing for the decision of her Majesty's Government on this subject. For all that has hitherto appeared the affair of the Nashville remains unsettled. It is certain that some definite and unmistakable rule which would include just such circumstances as those which surround the case of the Confederate ship ought to have been immediately promulgated by the Government, so that there might be no mistake as to the conditions on which armed vessels of either belligerent are henceforth to be allowed to enter British harbours, and as to the rights which they are to enjoy whilst they remain in harbour. It is true that a still more important event may bring the question of the relations which are to exist between this country and the Federals into a condition of exactitude; but it is just possible that the acts of the Commander of the San Jacinto to our mailsteamer Trent may not lead to hostilities between the two countries, and in that case the necessity for accurate and unmistakable rules of neutrality will be more than ever needed.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> greatest excitement prevailed at Southampton last Thursday week by the arrival in the waters there of a large paddle-sloop of war, with pennant, and flying the Confederate flag of America. She proved to be the Nashville, Captain Peagrim, which ran the blockade at Charleston on the 26th of October last; and on her coming to anchor there landed from her, with their personal effects, the crew (twenty-nine in number) of the late American slip Harvey Birch. This latter was a full-rigged vessel of 1500 tons burden, cost 150,000 dollars, and was bound from Havre to New York in ballast, but fallen in with by the Nashville on the morning of Tuesday, the 19th inst., and by her captured and destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The following is the statement of her commander, Captain W. H. Nelson:- The American ship Harvey Birch, of New York, left Havre on Saturday, the 17th inst., bound to New York, in ballast; when in lat 49.6 N., long. 9.52 W., was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagram, late of the United States' Navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who were at once ordered on board the Confederate steamer, allowing Captain Nelson and crew to take a few of their effects and some fresh provisions. The Harvey Birch was then ordered to to fired by Commander Peagrim, who remained alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o'clock the Nashville arrived off the entrance of the docks, and at one p.m. was moored alongside the north jetty, which was literally besieged with spectators. She brought as passengers, under orders of the Hon. the Secretary of the Navy, Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton is on special duty for the State of North Carolina, and, notwithstanding the length of the voyage and the heavy weather experienced throughout her passage, which carried away portions of her paddle-boxes. &c., they are in good health. He says that there are 750,000 bales of cotton of the old crop, and over 4,000,000 bales of the new crop, and 50,000,000 dols.' worth of tobacco and naval stores ready for shipment.</p>

<p>Captain Peagrim is an old officer of the United States' Navy, and bore a conspicuous part in the Mexican War, in the Paraguay and Japan expeditions, and during the war waged by the English and French in China. For his distinguished services his native State of Virginia voted him, by the unanimous voice of the General Assembly of the Legislature, a splendid sword, and Sir John Stirling, in his despatches to the Admiralty, makes the following mention of him:- "It is impossible to speak too highly of the American co-operating party engaged. They were with the Rattler, emulating each other in the thickest of the attack. But my warmest thanks in particular are due to Lieutenant Peagrim, the American senior officer: his encouragement of the men, and coolness under a heavy fire, and determined bravery, when surrounded by a persevering and revengeful foe, was conspicuous to all." First Lieutenant Fauntleroy was Aide-de-Camp to General Johnson at the battle of Manassas. Second Lieutenant Bennett served there in the naval battery, while one youngster on board named Cary received his appointment as midshipman in the Confederate navy as a reward for distinguished gallantry in the same action. The remainder of her company, chiefly Scotch and Irish, consists of two mates, eight midshipmen, paymaster, surgeon, engineer, and staff; firemen, coaltrimmers, and crew, amounting in all to some sixty men.</p>

<p>The Nashville does not carry a very formidable armament, having only two English 12-pounder rifled guns, of Captain Blakeley's manufacture. She is of 1100 tons burden and 800-horse power, and was built for the passenger and coasting trade between New York and Charleston. Though by no means qualified to make a thoroughly efficient ship-of-war, she is superior to many that have been adopted into the service of the belligerents. Like most American passenger-steamers, she is fitted with a deckhouse and hurricane-deck, which would have to be removed before she could he made to answer even tolerably as a gun-boat. Her paddle-wheels are, of course, a great drawback to her utility for actual warfare, while her machinery, being scarcely below the level of the deck, would, in all probability, be disabled by the first shot. She is a good model, and, in smooth water and proper trim, her speed is over fifteen knots an hour. In spite of her top-hamper the officers speak of her qualities as a seaboat, and of her performance during a succession of heavy gales, in terms of the highest praise. She is sister ship to the James Adger, Federal war-sloop, of eight guns.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Europa we are in receipt of papers to the 13th

and telegrams to the 15th, inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CAPTURE OF BEAUFORT.</p>

<p>Of the eighty-four transports and war-vessels which constituted the naval expedition when it set sail from Hampton Roads seventy-five arrived safely in the harbour of Port Royal, on the coast of South Carolina, about midway between Charleston and Savannah. The bombardment commenced on the 7th inst., and, after a fight of four hours, the Confederates abandoned the forts at the entrance to the inlet, and retreated precipitately. The Federals captured two forts, forty-three guns, military equipments, charts, and other valuable papers. The Confederates complain that their artillery was badly served, while that of their enemies was ably handled. The Federals in the attack lost only one gun-boat, whose hands were all saved. On the following day the Federal army, numbering 15,000 men, landed and established themselves at Beaufort, the seaside resort of the platers. The settlement, together with the neighbouring plantations, had been totally destroyed by the Confederates. Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp. The loss of life seems to have been small. The Federals set down their loss at eight; that of the Confederates is loosely estimated at a hundred. The small fleet of the Confederates, commanded by Commodore Tatnall, took no part in the action. Many of them escaped up the inlet leading to the Savannah river, others were run ashore, and the remainder were intercepted by the Federal vessels. Of the nine Federal vessels which were disabled en route, seven returned to Fortress Monroe, and two were wrecked on the coast of North Carolina. One of these contained ordnance stores, the other, troops to the number of 75 (who were taken prisoner) and horses, of whom all were lost except 15.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND</p>

<p>In Western Virginia the town of Guyandotte, on the Ohio River, was attacked by 600 Confederates, and, out of 150 Union troops stationed there, 100 were either killed or taken prisoners. The Confederates then retreated, when a loyal regiment retook the town and set fire to it, reducing the greater part to ashes.</p>

<p>At Piketown, the capital of Pike county, Kentucky, the easternmost county in the State, General Nelson (Federal) defeated General Williams's forces and took their leaders prisoners, The Secessionists lost 400 killed and a large number of prisoners.</p>

<p>A battle took place in Missouri on the 7th, of which the accounts are very unsatisfactory. It appears that an expedition left the Federal camp at Cairo, Illinois, and landed at Belmont, in Missouri, nearly opposite Columbia. The expedition numbered about 3500 men, and made an attack on a Confederate camp, numbering, they say, 7000. The enuny were driven out of their entrenchments, and their camp destroyed. As the Federals were retiring, booty laden, they were taken in the rear by a body of Confederates and compelled to retreat to their boats, leaving their booty to the enemy. The Federals admit a  loss of from 300 to 500 in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>The army of the West has not advanced beyond Springfield. General Halleck, of California, hss been appointed to command it. He is one of the four Major-Generals of the regular army of the United States. He entered the army in 1839, and is now about forty-two years of age. He has written two works on military matters, and till recently was practising law in San Francisco. General Fremont, on his return to St. Louis, received an ovation from the Germans of that city.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOUTHERN COAST.</p>

<p>The late gale, in which the North Briton was lost, raged with almost unexampled severity at Hatteras Inlet, and the high tide had overflowed the space outside the forts to such an extent that a new channel was being formed between them. It was apprehended that the forts might thus be rendered untenable. Some clothing and stores taken down from Fortress Monroe for the use of the Indiana regiment stationed there were washed away, after being landed, and lost. The ocamp of this regiment was submerged and everything it contained washed away. The regiment has since been brought back to Monroe. Much sickness prevails among the occupying force on hatteras.</p>

<p>The Southern journals report the arrival of the Confederate steamer Theodora at Savannah with a valuable cargo of stores.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda escaped from Charleston with a cargo of rosin and turpentine and 2000 bales of cotton. She was permitted to take a cargo of cotton as a mark of gratitude for the valuable supply of arms and ammunition she had brought; but, as a general rule, ships running the blockade for Europe are not allowed by the people to take cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis and Vice-President Stephens have been re-elected to the positions they now severally occupy.</p>

<p>Judah P. Benjamin has been appointed Secretary for War.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEFENCE OF THE COASTS.</p>

<p>Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, has written a caustic reply to Mr. Seward's circular letter. He objects to corresponding by slips cut from newspapers; he is surprised that the late Congress was not solicited to pass appropriations for this purpose if things were more menacing then than now. He says that he does not feel himself justified in calling a special Session of the State Legislature, while Congress will reassemble a month before the regular Session of the fotmer body. The whole subject of coast defences could only be dealt with by the general Government. Even if the States were to undertake the job, the competition in the money markets for loans between the nation and the States would be very injurious to both. Pennsylvania had already advanced considerable sums for raising volunteers, and the Federal Government had thrown great difficulties in the way of repayment. On the whole, he suggests the abandonment of Mr. Seward's plan.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The captain of the slaver Erie had been convicted of the capital offence by a New York jury. This is remarkable as being the only conviction of the kind since 1820 when the traffic was declared piracy by Congress. Another trial for a similar crime is progressing in New Bedford.</p>

<p>In New Jersey the Democratic party had carried the State. In Maryland the Union ticket prevailed. To this result the surveillance exercised over the polls by General Dix's troops greatly contributed.</p>
<p>A memorial was in circulation in St. Louis, asking Congress to relieve Missouri from the national taxes, because her citizens have already suffered so seriously from the war.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuters's office yesterday (Friday):-</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the Steamer City of New York, which arrived at Queenstown on Thursday, we have intelligence from New York to the 15th inst:-</p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence of the occupation of Beaufort by the Federals. The Charleston papers of the 12th inst. deny that the Federals have occupied the town, and state that reinforcements had been sent thither by the Confederates who were preparing to defend the town. The Federals, however, have occupied Hilton Island, the cotton crop on which was found to have been fired by the residents before leaving. The <hi rend="italics">Charleston Courier</hi> says there is little cotton stored at or near Beaufort. The New York journals state that the Federal Government has not determined whether Beaufort shall be made a port of entry. The Southern journals state that black flags have been hoisted at Charleston and Savannah as an indication that no quarter would be given and that none would be asked.</p>

<p>Eighteen Federal officers, prisoners of war at Richmond, have been selected to be hung, should the Federal Government hang the crew of the privateer Savannah.</p>

<p>Confirmatory accounts have been received of bridge-burning on a most extensive scale by the Union men of East Tennessee, Missouri.</p>

<p>The Federal army has evacuated Springfield, Missouri, returning to St. Louis.</p>

<p>It is reported that a United States' war-vessel has captured a large British steamer, supposed to be the Fingal, laden with arms, at Key West.</p>

<p>Colonel Cochrane, in addressing his regiment at Washington, urged the arming of the Southern slaves against their masters. The Secretary for War was present on the occasion, and is reported to have fully endorsed Colonel Cochrane's speech.</p>

<p>A despatch from Fortress Monroe reports the arrival of the United States' steam-sloop-of-war San Jacinto, with Messrs. Slidell and Mason on board.</p>

<p>The reported battle at Pikeville, Kentucky, was very much exaggerated. There were no killed, and the number of wounded and prisoners is reduced to 80 and 50 respectively.</p>

<p>The report of the capture of the Sumter has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">TARTLING</hi> news has been brought by the West Indian mail steamer La Plata, which arrived at Southampton on Wednesday. On the 8th inst. Mr. Slidell, the accredited commissioner to France from the Confederate States, and Mr. Mason, engaged on a similar mission to France, with their respective secretaries, Messrs. Eustis and M'Farland-who had run the blockade at Charleston and arrived at Havannah on the 18th ult., were forcibly taken out of the British mail-steamer Trent by the commander of the American steam-frigate San Jacinto.</p>

<p>It appears that on the 7th inst. the Trent sailed in her regular course of service from Havnnah for St. Thomas. On the following day, while the Trent was approaching a narrow passage in the Bahama Channel, a large steam-ship of war, which showed no colours, was seen waiting ahead. The Trent hoisted the British ensign, but elicited no responsive display of colours until she had approached within about 200 yards of the strange ship, which then fired a shot across the Trent's bow, hoisted the United States' flag, and fired a shell to leeward of the Trent. Captain Moir, the commander of the Trent, hailed the United States' steamer's captain, who replied that he wished to send a boat on board. A boat, containing two officers and ten men, boarded the Trent; and the boat's commanding officer, Lieutenant Fairfax, demanded to inspect the passenger-list, but was refused permission. He then declared that his commander, Captain Wilks, of the United States' steam-ship San Jacinto, had received information that Messrs. Shideil, Mason, Eustace, and M'Farland were among the passengers, and required that they should be given up to him. Captain Moir and Commander Williams, the naval officer in charge of the mails, refused to comply with the requisition; and the Confederate Commissioners, who were standing near, claimed the protection of the British flag under which they were sailing. Lieutenant Fairfax said he would take charge of the Trent, and made a signal to the San Jacinto, which immediately dispatched several armed boats, containing about 100 marines and seamen, who with drawn cutlasses boarded the Trent, arrested the Confederate Commissioners, and forced them into the boats. While this was doing, Commander Williams protested against the act in the following terms:-</p>

<quote rend="quoteblock">In this ship I am the representative of her Majesty'S Governmsnt, nd I call upon the officers of the ship and passengers generally to mark my words when, in the name of the British Government, and in distinct language, I denounce this as an illegal act, an act in violation of international law-an act, indeed, of wanton piracy, which, had we the means of defence, you would not dare to attempt.</quote>

<p>Mr. Slidell, as he was forced into the boat, requested the Trent's Captain to report exactly what had occurred, and declared that he looked to the British Government for redress for the outrage committed upon him while he was under the protection of the British flag. The American officers next complained that they were short of provisions, and asked for a supply for their prisoners, which was given by Captain Moir for the "exclusive use " of Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland. Lieutenant Fairfax said that he was ordered to take Captain Moir and his papers on board the San Jacinto; but Captain Moir refused to go unless he was forcibly removed from his quarterdeck. Lieutenant Fairfax thereupon told Captain Moir that he wanted nothing further, and ordered his men into the boats, which returned to the San Jacinto, leaving the Trent to prosecute her voyage.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 30, 1861.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has been for some time rumoured that a vessel of war bearing the flag of the Federal States of America was lying in the track of our West India mail-steamers with the intention of searching them for certain commissioners sent by the Confederate States to Europe. The statement was received with a good deal of incredulity, and the surprise and indignant feeling have been proportionably strong at the intelligence of the course pursued by the Commander of the San Jacinto towards the mail-packet Trent. Apart from the violation of right and the insult to the British flag which are necessarily involved in this transaction, there would appear to have been a savageness in the mode in which the proceedings were conducted, from which we are inclined to augur that the American officers were actuated by that feeling which generally induces persons who are doubtful whether they are in the right to overdo their parts. It is quite clear that it needed not the additional circumstances of ferocity implied in firing, first round shot and then shell, at an unarmed steamer, merely for the purpose of bringing her to; or the personal violence which is reported to have been used in the arrest of Mr. Slidell in particular, to elicit in a manner not to be mistaken the spirit of this country in regard to this proceeding. The most decided indications of public opinion have been afforded that England will not tamely submit to have her vessels boarded and passengers forcibly torn from beneath the protection of her flag. If, as has been asserted, it has been the object and design of the Federal Government to force Great Britain into an attitude of hostility, without question full reason and justification has been now afforded. Such an act, if done under the direct sanction and authority of the Executive at Washington, speaks for itself. Neither of the parties can desire a more complete "casus belli." It remains to be seen whether the proceedings of the commander of the San Jacinto will be adopted or disavowed by his Government. It is well known that American naval officers have been always somewhat hasty in asserting what they conceive to be the rights of their country; and in many cases it has been necessary on the part of those representatives of other countries with whom they have come into collision to exercise great forbearance. When the matter is looked at, considered with that coolness and calmness which its importance requires, it seems almost impossible to suppose that so flagrant a trespass on the rights which by international law are covered by a flag can have been deliberately planned by the American Government, or that when temperate but firm demands made for the disavowal of conduct on the face of it so unjustifiable on all grounds but one-that of seeking occasion for a quarrel-that disavowal will not be given. Notwithstanding the indignant feeling which has been evinced in this country on the receipt of this intelligence, there is no doubt that the gravity of the consequences which may ensue will be acknowledged by every Englishman. It is to be hoped that in the Northern States of America a corresponding feeling will prevail.</p>

<p>By the capture of Beaufort, the summer resort of Carolinian planters, the United States' Government have fully avenged the insult of Fort Sumter. In April the solo remiaining star-spangled banner on South Carolinian Soil was ignominiously lowered. In November the United States' flag has again been hoisted there, while that of the Confederates trails in the dust. But the war, in its ever-expanding magnitude, has long since outgrown the puerile issue on which it was commenced. The passionate resolve to redress an outrage inflicted on the Federal flag has long since deepened into a purpose of conquest. It would be a chimerical to hope that this success would tend to placate the North as that the forcible opening of a Southern port will lead to a renewal of the Southern trade with Europe.</p>

<p>This time, at least, the blow has fallen in the right place. Hitherto the border States-Maryland, Virginia (East and West), Kentucky, and Missouri-have alone felt the ravages which attend the shock of invading armies. Yet all these regions, except Eastern Virginia, are still in the Union. It has been the fate of the border Slave States to act as a sort of breakwater to the fury of the Northern storm behind which the revolutionary Gulf States dwelt in safety and comparative repose. On the Northern frontier of Secessia was the " shell" with which the far South incased its softer and more vital parts. All attempts to break through that shell by a front attack have hitherto failed. But the fleet has accomplished what the unaided army could not. South Carolina is the very heart and focus of the revolution, and the Isle of Anglesca of old was not more given up to Druidical worship than are the sea islands, on one of which the Federals are encamped, consecrated to slave-grown products. Negroes, rice, and the finest sorts of cotton-these are the pride and glory of Beaufort county, situated midway between Charleston and Savannah, the two principal southern ports on the Atlantic coast. Full five-sixths of the population of Beaufort county are slaves.</p>

<p>The angry North has at last condescended to carry the war into "Africa." In the border Slave States, where slavery is not of vigorous growth, the Administration and every General, except the deposed Fremont, have been sedulous to deprive the war of an anti-slavery character. But in this thickly-settled region, where slavery flourishes rankly, the Northern army of occupation must, in the very nature of things, and in spite even of the ingrained prejudices of the men composing it, become an instrument of emancipation. Already the telegraph tells us " Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp." These late chattels will not be restored to their owners. The Federal Government, which, in the border States, restores fugitives to "loyal" owners, rightly conjectures there are  no loyal proprietors in South Carolina, and at length allows its camp to be a gladsome City of Refuge to all who may flock thither. The slaves of this region, removed by a whole heaven from Canada, had no hope of escape from thraldom but death. A host of men from the North, contending for empire and a flag, but stung by the repulses at Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, suddenly appear in the midst of the negroes, consent to abandon their practice of slave-catching, and fastidiously resign themselves to the inevitable consequence that a chance of freedom will thereby be opened to a more or less numerous band of a downtrodden race. Had the midsummer cry of "Forward to Richmond!" availed we should never have heard of this autumnal invasion of the South Carolina coast. Adversity has taught the North to conquer one poor iota of her prejudices. It is this aspect of the camp at Beaufort which will give it an interest in the eyes of the onlooking world superior to that attaching to to Fortress Monroe, Hatteras Inlet, and Fort Pickens.</p>

<p>The second success of the fleet will be highly welcome to the Administration and the Commander-in-Chief, for two reasons- one political and one military. The Northern people had again grown impatient at the inaction or disasters of the two armies on the Lower and Upper Potomac. They demanded a victory, and demanded it in vain. General M'Clellan obstinately inculcated "patience," that virtue so difficult for an excited Democracy to observe. The universal feeling was," Something must be done; we want some equivalent for our money and other sacrifices." Popular enthusiasm threatened to flag, the subscriptions to the national loan fell off, and murmurs against the Administration began to make themselves heard. The achievements of the fleet will calm this dangerous mood of the public mind and give the Commander-in-Chief a few more weeks to mature his plans. In a military point of view, the 15,000 men at Beaufort will operate as an invaluable diversion of the enemy's forces. The invaders are within sixteen miles' distance of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, whose wooden bridges and trestle-work are easily destructible, and whose iron tires if once thrown into the river cannot now be replaced. The Confederates have to make head against a force of, say, 350,000 Federals pressing upon them on a line of 1500 miles, stretching from the Atlantic to the Missouri. Up to the present time they have done so with a fair amount of success. But can the Confederate Generals create new armies to watch every body of men whom the Federal fleet may throw upon their almost undefended coast? Or can they detach a sufficient number of men from the frontier without leaving the road to Richmond, Nashville, and Memphis open to their foes? It is evident that General Scott, for one, does not so believe, for his last words to time New Yorkers were, that by April or May next the "rebellion" would be surely crushed.</p>

<p>If the South still preserves the advantage of greater earnestness and singleness of purpose, the superior financial strength of the North begins to tell. The appeal of the planters to the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury and the reply thereto are signs that the South is "shortwinded" in this respect. Doubtless this difficulty would vanish if the South could make sale of her cotton, rice, and tobacco; but here the Federal fleet sails in and pitilessly relegates the South to her native resources. The Federal Government is well supported by the banks of the three chief cities of the North, and the people relieve the banks of the seven-and-three-tenths per cent Treasury notes nearly, but not quite, so fast as they are issued Northern patriotism, as expressed in <pb n="541">the readiness to take the Government loan, has by no means equalled the superabundant enthusiasm we are accustomed to witness in France on similar occasions, but seems to have exceeded the lagging offerings of the Italians for their late loan. American national sentiment, valued in dollars, stands midway between that of France and Italy. The immense quantities of grain and flour which the North has all this year been selling to British and French purchasers keep the exchange in favour of the Americans, and enable their banks, in spite of the stoppage of the usual export from the South, to retain the specie in their vaults. Thus confidence is maintained; the banks have not suspended specie payments and, notwithstanding Mr. Seward's uncalled-for and reckless circulars, Government and railroad stocks of loyal States are higher now than they have been since the Presidential election.</p>

<p>In the mean time, among the mountains of Western Virginia a revolutionary movement has been progressing which is independent, to some extent, of both North and South. The people of thirty-nine contiguous counties of the trans-Allegheny section of Virginia, occupying an area about twice the size of Wales, and numbering 282,000, of whom only 9000 are slaves, have declared their independence of the State of Virginia, and, organised themselves, with great unanimity, into a new state, called Kanawha, from the river of that name, which traverses it. Although the Kanawhans occupy a territory of giant value to the United States, and although the region has been liberated from Confederate armies by M'Clellan and Rosencranz, yet this demonstration meets with no favour from the Federal Government, which cannot now afford to countenance the right of revolution, even when it is made in behalf of the Union and the old flag. Separated as these people are from Eastern Virginia by physical barriers similar to those which divide Savoy from Italy, and united to the adjacent free-labour States by similar pursuits and moral and political sympathies, it is very improbable, come what may, that the old territorial arrangements will ever be restored. But the incident furnishes another proof that the air of America was charged with revolution, and that the time was ripe for a recombination of the heterogeneous elements of which the United States for the last forty years have been composed.</p>

<P>M<hi rend="smallcaps">UCH</hi> interest is felt in the recent determination of the Federal Government to fortify its coast, lake, and frontier line, as conveyed in Mr. Seward's instructions of the 14th of October. The American Government, however, have for some time past been repairing and enlarging the system of fortifications on the Canadian frontier. One of the strongest of the enlarged works is Fort Montgomery, at Rowse's Point, at the head of Lake Champlain. This fort has been nicknamed Fort Blunder, because erected upon British soil, afterwards given up, under treaty, to the United States. The fort has been considerably enlarged, and is now nearly completed. It will mount sixty-five guns in position, and twenty-five en barbette. It is protected on the land side by a moat and rampart of earth; and, on the whole, it is a very formidable work. Rowse's Point is about thirty-eight miles from Montreal, and upon the main line of railway communication between Boston, New York, and Canada. Lake Champlain, which lies between the States of New York and Vermont, extending for four miles into Lower Canada, is 105 miles in length, north to south, its breadth varying from ten miles to half a mile. It contains numerous islands, receives several rivers, and discharges its superfluous waters by the Richelieu river into the St. Lawrence. This lake was the centre of  many important military operations during the revolutionary war, and now forms an important medium of commerce.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> British public has been agitated by intense excitement during the past week by the apparent imminence of a rupture of friendly relations between this country and America. To the facts which have occasioned this state of things, and to the light in which they may be viewed by the law of nations, we shall presently advert. Before doing so, however, we gladly recognise the possibility, and express the hope, faint though it be, that the matter in dispute may be satisfactorily settled, even before the publication of our present Number. Our remarks are intended to bear upon the facts as they stood at the moment of our going to press; and should any authentic information from the other side of the Atlantic reach our shores before these pages are in the hands of our readers which will render the following comments unnecessary, because untimely, none will rejoice more heartily than ourselves at being "a day after the fair."</p>

<p>The fact of the case lie in a very narrow compass; the statement of them, although hitherto <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> only, rests upon the concurrent testimony of several witnesses, and may faitly be assumed as trustworthy. They are so well known that it will not be necessary for us to give more than the barest outline of them. Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Commissioners of the Confederate States of America to France and England, together with their Secretaries, having succeeded in evading the blockade, and in reaching the neutral port of Havannah, engaged berths on board the mail-steamer La Plata from St. Thomas. Being on neutral ships, they made no secret of their intentions, nor of the official capacity in which they were acting. While these gentlemen were waiting at Havannah for the sailing of the Trent, the San Jacinto, an armed sloop in the service of the Federal Government at Washington, called at the port, having just left her station on the coast of Africa. Captain Wilks, the commander of the San Jacinto, under general instructions, it is presumed, from his own Government, for the time was too short to admit of special insructions, determined upon intercepting the Commissioners on their way to St. Thomas, and for this purpose started from Havannah to the Bahama Channel, a narrow roadstead through which the Trent would have to pass. As soon as the British mail-steamer hove in sight the San Jacinto made all ready to stop, search, and, if resisted, to sink her. The first step taken by the Captain of the American cruiser was to fire a shot across the bows of the Trent, and to show her colours; but, as the British steamer did not heed the summons, his next proceeding was to fire a shell, which exploded within a hundred yards of her. The Trent, being unarmed, immediately brought to, and Lieutenant Fairfax was sent on board to demand a list of the passengers. This having been refused, the Lieutenant said he had good reason to know that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, and their secretaries, were among the passengers, and he required that they should be given up to him. On the refusal of Captain Moir to comply with this requisition three boats' crews were dispatched from the Federal sloop, and boarded the trent, cutlass in hand. Further resistance on the part of Captain Moir was of course out of the question; and, under formal protest, the four gentlemen were seized and carried off as prisoners to the San Jacinto, and the Trent allowed to proceed on her voyage.</p>
 
<p>These facts have been laid before the law officers of the Crown, who have decided that the Captain of the San Jacinto has committed a breach of international law, and a dispatch from the British Government is already on its way to Lord Lyons, instructing him, it has been said, to demand the restoration of the captured gentlemen to the protection from which they have been illegally taken, and a disavowal and apology on the part of the Federal Government for the act of their own officer. If this demand be not complied with, it is rumoured that our Minister at Washington will forthwith return home;<pb n="568"> Mr. Adams, the American Minister at London, will be furnished with his passports; and diplomatic relations between the two countries will be broken off, in anticipation of war.</p>

<p>The ground upon which the law officers of the Crown rest their decision appears to be the only ground which could have been safely taken. The right of the San Jacinto to stop and search the Trent for contraband of war is not disputed. It is a right which Great Britain, as a foremost maritime power, has done her utmost to establish. The inclusion of persons as well as things within the category of contraband is also undoubted, although it remains a moot point (which, however, we shall not discuss) whether the diplomatic agents of one belligerent can be lawfully seized by another while proceeding in a neutral vessel between two neutral ports. It is a nice legal question, requiring for its decision the deliberate and solemn adjudication of a prize court. That which seems to be clear is that commanders of ships are not authorised by the law of nations, and cannot safely be permitted, to act on board neutral vessels on their own private views of law. The Captain of the San Jacinto, even on the hypothesis that Messrs. Slidell and Mason came within the description of contraband, was bound to carry the Trent into the nearest port, there to await the decision of a regularly constituted prize court. Had such decision been in his favour, we should have had no illegality of which to complain; had it been against him he would have been responsible for whatever damage he had inflicted upon the proprietors or the passengers of the Trent, in consequence of her interruption and detention. It may he quite true that by pursuing a legal course, instead of the high-handed one upon which he acted, he would have subjected the owners, crew, and passengers of the Trent to much more serious annoyance than they have now to complain of. But it is also true that by allowing the precedent we should open a wide door for every variety of insult to our mercantile marine from the ignorance, caprice, or passion of American commanding officers. Neutral vessels are not to be adjudged guilty of violating the laws of neutrality by every petty officer who has the authority and the power to arrest them. It might be very convenient, no doubt, in certain imaginable instances, for a police-constable to seize goods suspected to be stolen and simply to hand them over to the reputed owner. It would save an immensity of annoyance in some cases; but it is judged to be safer, on the whole, to refer the decision to a court of law, where evidence can be given on both sides and impartially sifted, and where verdict and sentence have a chance of being delivered with due and dispassionate deliberation. Now, international law is founded mainly upon the same principles of justice as those which are embodied in municipal law; and the very existence of prize courts rests upon the implication that between belligerents and neutrals all questions that arise shall be decided, not by an individual and private but by a public interpretation of the rights respectively of both parties.</p>

<p> But, believing, as we do, that a gross and, if sanctioned by submission, a dangerous infraction of international law and the rights of neutrals has been committed by the commander of the San Jacinto, we see many incidents connected with the case that should induce Great Britain to present her claim to reparation with as much calmness, considerateness, and forbearance as a due regard for the honour of her flag and the safety of her commercial marine will admit of, one or two of the most important of which we proceed, in the interest of peace, to submit to the judgment of our readers.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it deserves to be borne in mind that we are as yet without any trustworthy evidence that the act of Captain Wilks was done in obedience to instructions received from the Federal Government at Washington. The probabilities all lie the other way. The San Jacinto had but just left the coast of Africa, and had put into Havannah before it was possible for her to have had recent communications from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet. It was there and then only that he could have ascertained the intention of Messrs. Slidell and Mason to go out by the Trent, and no sufficient interval was left him to submit his project to the judgment of the Cabinet. Mr. Adams, the American Minister in London, volunteered, immediately on the arrival of the news by the La Plata, a statement of his conviction that the Federal Government knew nothing whatever of the transaction until after it was consummated. The rumours which have reached us from America since the arrival of the prisoners at Fort Monroe lend additional probability to this opinion. Captain Wilks was stated to have hinted in the course of a conversation with General Wool at the possible alternative of being cashiered for his act-a proof, if true, that he had acted without authority. Lord Lyons, our Minister at Washington, is reported to have expressed his opinion that Messrs. Sidell and Mason would be given up to England. The next arrival may bring us an assurance that the Federal Government have honourably declined to take advantage of the wrong committed by their own officer, and the amicable relations of the two Governments may be re-established upon a sounder basis than before.</p>

<p>In the next place, it behoves us to remember that the rights of belligerents, as against neutrals, a strained and unofficial interpretation of which has led to the present disagreeable dilemma, are mainly, if not solely, rights which England herself has persisted in establishing, not merely in the face of many protests, but even to the extremity of war. We are not, therefore, in a position to fire up in anger, or to proceed in haste or in harshness to the last fearful arbitrement in vindication of the wrong we believe ourselves to have received. And, in the last place, we may well make some allowance for the difficulties which surround the Lincoln Administration, and, if we cannot safely pass by such an offence as that perpetrated by Captain Wilks, we might, at any rate, act as courteously and considerately as possible in the prosecution of our demands. In this spirit and with these views we hope her Majesty's Government are dealing, and will deal, with the matter. Hitherto the great majority of the people of England have kept their natural excitement under creditable restraint, and we firmly believe will be prepared to make any sacrifice of feeling, not inconsistent with national honour, in order to avert a war with their American kin. We earnestly trust that their forbearance will meet with its due reward, and that by disavowing the act of Captain Wilks, and surrendering the Southern Commissioners to the hands from which they were summarily and rudely taken, the Federal Government will save themselves, the world, and us from hostilities which, while they would disgrace humanity, would bring nothing but evil to either party.</p>

<p rend="center">OPINIONS OF THE FRENCH PRESS ON THE SEIZURE OF<lb/> 
MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>

<p>The whole of the Paris press, and more especia1ly the semi-official journals, warmly espouse the side of England in her quarrel with the American Federal Government.</p>

<p>An article in the<hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>, written in a semi-official style, after pointing out how deeply France is interested in the American question, proposes that, in case of a rapture between England and America, France should coincide with England in any recognition of the Southern Confederacy, and, in order to render any resistance on the part of the Northern States out of the question, unite her naval forces with those of England. "At this moment (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> the fate of two peoples and perhaps the repose of the world, is in the hands of the Cabinet of Washington. Its resolutions may lead to events of incalculable importance; but in any case we cannot but admit that England is right to act as she is doing. We will go further-she is merely accomplishing a rigorous duty, commanded by the circumstances, and all Europe will approve her conduct." In another article headed "How is France to act?" the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> expresses more decided views:- "In our opinion (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>) it is difficult for her to remain indifferent in presence of a violation of international law which concerns all maritime nations. We believe that very likely the Northern States will refuse to accede to the demands made by England; in that case we may presume that war will be immediately declared, and the first act of hostility will be the recognition of the Southern States .... We are convinced that the war between the two countries will be an interminable one, but, on the other hand, we cannot remain idle spectators of a struggle between North America and England. It is quite clear that it is not our duty to avenge the wrongs of England, but the recognition of the South by that Power, which would imply a final separation from the United States, could not be regarded as an isolated act, and would impose upon France the necessity of assuming a decisive attitude in this question. The result would be that two great maritime Powers of Europe might be drawn into a common action with the same identical political object; and, that being the case, as we have observed before, President Lincoln, by provoking an act of brutality, may perhaps have acted with foresight by preparing a separation which he can neither propose nor accept." In another article the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> seems to foreshadow a disposition on the part of the French Government to recognise the Southern Confederacy if England should set the example of recognition.</p>

<p>With regard to the affair of the Trent the <hi rend="italic">Pays</hi> says:- " The irritation excited in England, and the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, will perhaps make the Washington Cabinet reflect seriously, and induce it to offer the fullest reparation to the British Government. If Mr. Lincoln refuses reparation for the insult to the Trent, the entire responsibility of the consequences will rest with him."</p>

<p>The<hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> says:-"In fact, it is impossible that the Americans should not understand how irregular is the arrest of MM. Slidell and Mason on board the Trent; how contrary it is to the law of nations; and how prejudicial the consequences of this act would be to themselves. It would be the consecration of the 'right of search,' against which they have always protested, and which was one of the chief causes of the war they themselves waged with England in 1812-a right of search exercised no only on commercial vessels but on ships of war, for the mail-steamers are Royal vessels, having on board a Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, and their officers wear the uniform of the British Navy. By declaring contraband of war simple passengers with or without a diplomatic mission the Americans strike a mortal blow against the privileges of neutral States, which it is to their interest more than to any one else to see respected."</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">D&eacute:bats</hi> thinks that the neglect of Captain Wilks to seize the despatches on board the Trent was a fatal oversight.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> thinks that the Emperor Napoleon has tendered, or will tender, his good offices or mediation for the settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL SCOTT ON THE AFFAIR OF THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The United States' Consul has communicated to the French papers a letter of General Scott (who is now in Paris), in which he declares there is no truth in the report that the Cabinet of Washington had ordered the seizure of the Southern Commissioners, even if under the protection of a neutral flag. He is quite ignorant of the decision of his Government, but he says it is necessary to preserve good relations between America and England. "I hope," continues General Scott, "that Earl Russell and Mr. Seward will agree on a solution of the question whether the persons who were arrested on board the Trent were contraband of war or not. If they were agents of the rebels it will be difficult to convince even impartial minds that they were less contraband of war than rebel soldiers or cannons." In conclusion, General Scott expresses a conviction that a war between America and England, cannot take place without more serious provocations than those at present given.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The Toronto <hi rend="italic">Lender</hi>, the most influential organ of the Canadian Ministry, characterises the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell as "the most offensive outrage which Brother Jonathan has ever dared to perpetrate on the British flag. It strikes at the root of British authority, and affirms a right on the part of the Northern States to which the meanest nation in Christendom could not honourably submit. We assume that Lord Lyons will at once demand from the Washington Government a disavowal of the act of their Commodore and the release of Messr. Mason and Slidell. Not to assume this, would be to suppose that Britain is indifferent to the rights and honour of her flag."</p>

<p>The American vessel the Lady Franklin entered Plymouth Sound on Tuesday, and at midnight a fire broke out in her forehold which ended in her total destruction. It is supposed that the fire was wilful, some of the crew being Southerners, and it appears several of them have absconded. Lady Franklin was in ballast.</p>

<p>Some months ago the Perthshire, a large colonial vessel of 840 tons, the property of Mr. William Gray, if Hartlepool, was boarded without legal warrant by the United States' steamer Massachusetts, off the American coast, on the alleged ground that the Perthshire had violated the blockade of the Southern ports. The case was represented by the British Minister to the Government at Washington, and Earl Russell has informed the owner that the President will recommend Congress to vote $pound:200 as compensation.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> U<hi rend="smallcaps">NITED</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">TATES'</hi> N<hi rend=smallcaps">AVY</hi>-The statistics of the United States' Navy show ten slops of the line, the youngest of which was built in 1840. Four were still on the stocks, four were at Norfolk when that port was abandoned. There are ten sailing-frigates of 50 guns: two were built in 1797; not one is of 1500 British tons burden; the youngest were built in 1855. There are twenty sloops of from 24 to 16 guns: the youngest was built in 1854. They are too small for their armament. The steam navy is the kernel of the naval force of the Federal Government. It consists of five screw-frigates built, and one building. These are of the Niagra and Minnesota School. There are six first-class steam-sloops. Of these the crack ship is the Brooklyn, 25 guns, and to this class belongs the San Jacinto, 13 guns. There are three paddle-steamers- the Powhattan represents the class; and eight-second class screw steam-sloops and one paddle-wheel- all except the last, built since 1855; they carry from 6 to 3 guns. The third-class screw-sloops, four in number, carry more guns-one 8, the other 5. There are four paddle-steamers, two of 3 guns and two of 1. Three steam-tenders make up the Navy, consisting,<hi rend="italic">on paper</hi>, of a total of 10 line-of-battle ships, 10 frigates, 20 sloops, 3 brigs, and 3 troop-ships- all these aree sailers; of 6 screw-frigates, of 18 screw and 8 paddle-wheel sloops, and of 3 steam-tenders. The Federal Government has increased the list by 100-merchant ships fitted out to maintain the blockade.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the Cunard steamer Persia we have received New York journals of the 20th ult.</p>

<p>The principal subject of interest is the reception of the news of the capture of Messrs. Mason and Slidell on board the British steamer Trent. The American account of the affair agrees with that of Captain Moir, except in that it is represented that all the documents of Messrs. Mason and Shidell were seized. It is also admitted that Captain Wilks, of the San Jacinto, acted without orders from Washington, that ship having only just returned to the West Indies from Africa. The news of the capture was received with great joy by the people of the large cities, although the means by which it was made caused a fall of stocks on Wall-street. The captives were transferred from New York to Fort Warren, near Boston. Commodore Wilks is the same officer who commanded the United States' exploring expedition in 1838-42, the account of which was given to the world in five large volumes.</p>

<p rend="center">WHAT THE NORTHERN JOURNALS SAY CONCERNING THE SEIZURE OF<lb/>
 MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>
<p>The journals are full of quotations from Vattel, Wheaton, Phillimore, and Kent, and if decisions of Lord Stowell, to prove that the dipatches, and the Commissioners who carried them, were "contraband of war," subjecting the vessel to the penalty of capture and condemnation in a Prize Court. The practice of taking British seamen out of American merchant ships at the commencement of this century is cited as estopping Great Britain from any right to object. The cutting out of the Caroline from New York waters, by Sir Allan McNab in 1837, is brought forward, the circumstances that preceded and justified that act being omitted by the journal that cites it. Mr. George Sumner, of Boston, mentions the capture of Mr. Laurens, the American Ambassador, in 1780, as having been made from a Dutch vessel, which, however, is erroneous, the vessel being an American one. The journals do not seem generally to anticipate that the irregularity of allowing the Trent to proceed on her way would give cause of offence to the British Government and nation. They regard it as an act of kindness on the part of Commodore Wilks. Of the New York journals, only the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi> doubted whether the Commissioners were contraband, and called them "political prisoners under the protection of a neutral flag," whose seizure was unjustifiable, and ought to be repudiated by the United States' Government. The two organs of the French population in New York regarded the seizure as a breach of international law. The <hi rend="italic">Boston Advertiser</hi> preserves its usual moderation and judgment, and "inclines to the belief" that the despatches and Ambassadors were contraband of war. The rest of the journals of the three principal cities, which are written in the English language, treat the matter as one too plain for doubt. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is as brutal in its utterances as usual; the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Commerce</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> simply reflect the feeling of the people, and affect to believe that England, far from remonstrating, will "applaud the gallant act of Lieutenant Wilks, so full of spirit and good sense, and such an exact imitation of the policy she has always stoutly defended and invariably pursued."</p>

<p rend="center">A VIOLATION OF NEW GRANADIAN NATIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
<p>General Sumner, in command of a regiment of the regular army of the United States, seized three returning Californians on board the Panama steamer on a charge of "Southern proclivities." On their arrival at the Isthmus the Governor protested against the passage of these political prisoners across the soil of Now Granada. General Sumner, backed by the force of his regiment, refused to forego his design, and the Governor contented himself with a protest.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERANT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>
<p>The reports of Captain Dupont and Brigadier-General Sherman have appeared. The capture of the forts was made with the loss of fifteen killed and wounded on the Federal side. The loss of the means of debarkation forced the Commanders to abandon their projected attack by land. The negroes had sacked Beaufort and were very favourably disposed towards "the Yankees." Many of the negroes who would not flee with their masters to the woods were shot by their owners, and this cruel proceeding had greatly exasperated the survivors.
<p>Another naval expedition, under General Butler, was in an active state of preparation at Boston.</p>
<p>General Dix has landed 4000 troops on the eastern shore of Virginia, and has issued a proclamation guaranteeing constitutional rights to loyal inhabitants. It is reported that the Federals were well received by the people of Accomac and Northampton counties.</p>
<p>The Federals have now 480,000 men in arms, lacking only 20,000 of the numter authorised by Congress.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARMING OF THE SLAVES.</p>
<p>Colonel Cochrane, a lifelong pro-slavery Democrat, in an address to his regiment, proclaimed "the military necessity of the emancipation of the slaves." The Secretary of War (Mr. Cameron), who was present, followed with a short but significant speech to this effect:-
<p>Soldiers!- It is too late for me to make you it speech to-night, but I will say that I heartily approve every sentiment uttered by your noble commander. The doctrines which he has laid down I approve as if they were my own words. They are my sentiments-sentiments which will not only lead you to victory, but which will in the end reconstruct this our glorious Federal Constitution. It is idle to talk about treating with these rebels upon their own terms. We must meet them as our enemies, treat them as enemies, and punish them as enemies, until they shall learn to behave themselves. Every means which God has placed in our hands it is our duty to use for the purpose of protecting ourselves. I am glad of the opportunity to say here, what I have already said elsewhere, in these few words, that I approve the doctrines this evening enunciated by Colonel Cochrane.</p>
<p>General Burnside, of Rhode Island, and Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, the colleague of Charles Sumner, have made declarations of similar import. The latter said:-</p>
<p>It was poor policy to manage the war otherwise. It was useless to send our men from their firesides, their workshops, and their farms to die upon the Southern soil if the cause of the war were not removed, and the power that brought on the conflict, without a cause, and aimed at the destruction of the Republic, remained untouched in the chief source of its strength.</p>
<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>Five bridges on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad have been burned by the Unionists of East Tennessee. This line is the most important line of communication between Virginia and the SouthWestern States.</p>
<p>Colonel Corcoran, of the 69th (Irish) Regiment, has bean thrown into gaol as a hostage for the privateersmen condemned in New York, and twelve other officers are designated as hostages for the safety of the rest of the privateer's crew.</p>
<p>The Georgia planters have held a convention in which it was resolved that if the present cotton crop remain unsold they will not plant any cotton next year.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>The New York banks have asked for and obtained a postponement of the time when they will be called upon to take the third 50,000,000 dollars of the national loan until the 1st of January next.</p>
<p>Another condemnation of a culprit for engaging in the slave trade has taken place. The trial was held in New Bedford.</p>
<p>Edwin James has been engaged by the <hi rend="italic">New York Leader</hi>, a weekly newspaper of no high standing, to write autobiographical experiences. The editor offers him 2000 dollars for a series of articles of this kind.</p>

<p>A numerously-attended meeting of American residents in Paris assembled a few days ago at, the Hotel Westminster, to present their respects to General Scott, on the occasion of his arrival in that city. His Excellency Mr. Dayton, the United States Minister, in addressing the General on behalf of his countrymen in Paris, assured him of their respect for himself personally, and their high appreciation of the value of his long services to his country, referring particularly to the activity and energy displayed in his recent loyal defence of the capital when threatened by the Confederates of the South,, and declaring that his countrymen would ever cherish in their hearts a grateful recollection of his name. He expressed their regret at the feeble state of his health, and their wishes for his speedy restoration; and trusted that, on his return home, he would find his country once more happy and united,and  more prosperous than ever. General Scott, who seemed much affected at the compliment paid him, replied in suitable terms.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Federal Camp on the Potomac continues to forward to us Illustrations of noteworthy incidents in connection with the civii war raging in that part of the States. Four of these, respecting which he writes as follows, are given on the accompanying pages:-Fifty miles below Washington the Confederates have constructed some formidable batteries on the Virginia shore of the Potomac, opposite to a place known as Budd's Ferry. Among the series of sketches forwarded you will find one showing Budd's house, and a small earthwork mounting two 10-pound Parrott guns, which teh Federalists have there in position. Preparations are being made at the same point for attack on the COnfederate batteries over the river, three exceedingly heavy ones having been unmasked.

ran the blockade by hugging the Maryland shore closely, where the water shoals considerably. Heavy vessels dare not risk it, as the deep channel lies right under the batteries, and the consequence is the blockade of the Potomac may be looked upon as effective. We on our side watched the little ships anxiously as they came within range of the enemy's guns, which they no sooner did than a terrible fire of shot and shell opened upon them, not one, however being struck seriously, and all enabled to keep their course down river. We, the spectators ran probably more risk than the vese1s, for many of the shells came over to our neighbourhood, bursting in close proximity to where we stood. Our turn then came, and we gave them a few rounds from the tiny Parrotts, pitching the 10-pound shells right into their works, and peppering a steamer, one of the Confederate navy, until they were glad to haul her into Quantico Creek. The river at this point is a mile and three quarters in breadth. My "Reconnaissance with General Sickles in the Bed of the Potomac" was a most remarkable ride, for nearly the whole time we had to wade to our horses' girths in the river itself, sometimes even swimming, the banks being impracticable in places.

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> one topic of the day is the great question whether American democracy will permit American statesmanship to do right. No other subject has any claim to Present discussion; for it is impossible to talk of social reforms, or other of the ordinary themes of the journalist, when England, making a stand for her honour, but in nowise irritated or unreasonable, awaits the tidings whether the New Year is to be inaugurated by the signal for war. At another time it might be interesting to hear that the Mexicans have resolved not to risk a struggle with the great Powers that have united to put down piracy and ruffianism in Mexico, and to assert the rights of civilisation. We might be glad to know that there was a probability of these objects being effected without bloodshed, and we might urge upon the Governments to be in no hurry to believe in the value of promises extorted by fear, and which must be rendered valuable by material guarantees, and by the condign punishment of those who have been indulging for years in tyranny and robbery. But an expedition which excited some interest a month ago may now sail almost unmarked, except that England casts a not unsatisfied glance at her own share in the ships, and is glad that they are sailing westward. The Indian news is far from uninteresting, but, except that we shall be glad to hear that the Indian cotton crop is likely to be quadrupled, we have not much attention for the Oriental Empire. On Christmas Day many of the gathered households of the country may be graver than is their wont at that season.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Number last week contained an account of the forcible seizure of Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Confederate Commissioners to France and England, on board the Trent, by bodies of armed men from the United States' war-ship San Jacinto; and we now give, on the preceding page, an Engraving representing this violation of international law-which will be attended, it is to be feared, with the very gravest consequences. The purser of the mail-steamer Trent supplies the following narrative of the circumstances attending the boarding of that vessel by the Lieutenant and men of the American sloop-of-war San Jacinto and the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners:-
<p>I hasten to forward some particulars of the grievous outrage committed today (Nov. 8)against the English flag by the United States' steam-sloop San Jacinto, Captain Wilks. You have probably heard how, some three weeks ago, the little steamer Theodora, having on board the commissioners sent by the Confederate States of America to London and Paris, ran the blockade at Charlston, arriving safely in Havannah. Once arrived there,they, of course, imagined that on neutral territory they were perfectly free and safe from all molestation, and therefore made no attempt to conceal their names, position, and intendedmovements. Mr. Slidell, the commissioner for Paris, was accompanied by his wife, son, and three daughters, and also by his secretary, Mr. G. Eustis, with his wife, Mr. Mason, the Commissioner for England, being accompanied by his secretary, Mr. M'Farland. It was well known in Havannah that berths were booked for the whole party to proceed by this steamer to St. Thomas, there to join the homeward West India mail steam-ship for Southamton. They accordingly embarked yesterday morning, trusting, to receive the same protection under the English flag which they had already received from that of Spain.</p>
<p>We left Havannah yesterday morning at eight. This morning, about half-past eleven, we observed a large steam-ship ahead, and on a nearer approach found she was hove to, evidently awaiting us. We were then in the narrowest part of the Bahama Channel, abreast of Paredon Grande Lighthouse. As soon as we were well within range we had the first intimation of her nationality and intentions by a round-shot being fired across our bows, and at the same moment by her showing American colours. We were now sufficiently near to observe that all her ports were open, guns run out, and crew at their stations. On a still nearer approach she fired a shell from a swivel-gun of large calibre on her forecastle, which passed within a few yards of the ship, bursting about a hundred yards to leeward. We were not within hail, when Captain Moir, commanding this ship, asked the American what he meant by stopping his ship, and why he did so by firing shotted guns, contrary to usual custom. The reply was that he wished to send a boat on board of us. This was immediately followed by a boat pushing off from the side of the San Jacinto, containing between twenty and thirty men, heavily armed, under the command of the First Lieutenant, who came up on the quarter-deck, and, after asking for Captain Moir, demanded a list of passengers. As his "right of search" was denied, the information required was, of course, peremptorily denied. He then stated that he had information that Messrs.
Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland were on board, and demanded that they should be given up. This also being indignantly refused, Mr. Slidell himself came forward and said that the four gentlemen named were then before him, but he appealed to the British flag, under which they were sailing, for protection. The Lieutenant said that his orders were to take them on board the San Jacinto by force if they would not surrender. He then walked to the side of the ship waved his hand: immediately three more heavily-armed boats pushed off and surrounded the ship, and the party of marines who come in first boat came up and took possession of the quarter-deck; these, however, he ordered down on the main-deck, to take charge of the gangway ports. Captain Williams, R.N., the naval agent in charge of the mails, who was of course present during this interview, then, in the name of her Majesty, he being the only person on board directly representing her, made a vehement protestation against this piratical act.</p>
<p>During the whole of this time the San Jacinto was about 200 yards distant from us on the port beam, her broadside guns, which were all manned, directly bearing upon us. Any open resistence to such a force was of course hopeless, although, from the loud and repeated plaudits which followed Captain William's protestations, and which were joined in by every one, without exception, of the passengers congregated on the quarter-deck, men of all nations, and from the manifested desire of some to resist to the last, I have no doubt but that every person would have joined heart and soul in the struggle had our Commander but given the order. Such an order he could not, under such adverse circumstances, conscientiously give, and it was therefore considered sufficient that a party of marines, with bayonets fixed, should forcibly lay hands on the gentlemen named. This was done, and the gentlemen retired to their cabins to arrange some few changes of clothing. A most heartrending scene now took place between Mr. Slidell, his eldest daughter-a noble girl devoted to her father-and the Lieutenant. It would require a far more able pen than mine to describe how, with flashing eyes and quivering lips, she threw her herself in the doorway of the cabin where her father was, resolved to defend him with her life, till, on the order being given to the marines to advance, which they did, with bayonets pointed at this poor defenceless girl, her father ended the painful scene by escaping from the cabin by a window, when he was immediately seized by the marines and hurried into the boat, calling out to Captian Moir as he he left that he held him and his Government responsible for this outrage.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> attitude and bearing of the people of England under the circumstances which have arisen in connection with the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners on board the Trent have been in all respects worthy of the occasion. This is not the verdict of mere self-complacency, but ample testimony has been borne by the press of France to the mingled dignity, moderation, and firmness of purpose which have been displayed by the whole country, and without exception of class. The bitterest satirists on England and the English have failed to find anything in our conduct on which to base even a sneer; while for an accusation no shadow of a foundation has been discovered. If it were necessary we might quote some of the language of writers in Continental journals in which our national spirit, our unanimity of feeling, and our consciousness of being in the right are held up to admiration in no measured terms; but we only refer to these eulogies for the purpose of illustration, and with no desire to make more of a highly creditable state of things than it deserves. It would certainly have been a melancholy thing if a country like this should on the occurrence of an act of aggression have set about to scold and vapour with all the sound and fury of those, whether persons or nations, who are assured neither of their position nor the rights of the matter in dispute; and therefore, while admitting simply and unostentatiously the justice of any commendation which we have received for our conduct in this juncture of our national affairs, we can afford to be almost surprised that any one should have conceived it could have been other than it has been. It is to be observed that, as the time since the intelligence of the Jacinto affair was 
<p>

		</figure></p>

received has run on, the public mind has taken a calmer view of the situation; but, nevertheless, there has not appeared any abatement of the resolute determination to hold to the honour of England at all hazards which was the first sensation that pervaded the land. If there be any change in the view of this question-and we think there is-it is a growing incredulity with regard to the necessity for a resort to the bloody arbitrement of the sword. Reflection, consideration, examination of the subject in all its bearings, seem to lead to something like a conviction that, if a similar process be applied to the question on the other side of the water, it must result in a peaceable issue. The most recent accounts show that some change has come over the spirit in which most of the Federal so-called organs of public opinions deal with this subject. The tone adopted by these journals is much more serious and practical than that which characterised the delivery of opinions on the first blush of the matter; and something has been done to familiarise the popular mind in America with the surrender of the Confederate Commissioners as a contingency by no means remote. Some of them go so far as to say that the recent event cannot-we suppose because it ought not- be a cause of war; and others have allowed that, if the act of the officers of the Federal navy is not justifiable by the law of nations, it cannot inflict any wound on the national honour to make a suitable apology. The signs of the existence of such a feeling, however feeble they may be, are not without significance, and from them may be  drawn auguries of things to come which, we believe, the most sensitive Englishmen would be willing enough to witness. It must be remembered that these indications of a tendency to
<p>

		</figure></p><pb n="592">
concession in America have taken place before there has been any knowledge of the manner in which the affair of the Trent has been received in England. Surely the august spectacle of a nation unanimous for the vindication of its honour, and consentaneous in its conviction that that honour has been wounded, cannot be without its effect even on a nation so impulsive as the Americans. It is with a full consciousness of all the disadvantages, present and prospective, to both countries which must follow a war such as that which we are obliged to contemplate, but ready at all points for even such a contingency, that England awaits the result of the intercommunication between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In the mean time, in a spirit of perfect candour, and divesting ourselves of any mere partisanship, it may be worth while to consider some of the disadvantages which this untoward act- for untoward it is from any point of view-is calculated to bring upon the cause for which the Northern States are contending. It is useless to blink the fact that the civil war has assumed a magnitude which probably we in Europe did not contemplate, and which has called forth at the very earliest period all the resources of the North. The visions of a rapid subjugation of the South in one triumphant campaign have faded before the stern reality of the situation; and, while it is broadly stated on all hands on this side of the water that a restoration of the old Union is assuming the aspect of an impossibility, it has been whispered that such an opinion has secretly taken root in the minds of the Cabinet at Washington, and that a contest with England is adopted as a policy out of which may spring a pretext for the ultimate acknowledgment of the independence of the South. If this is really the case, why, all ground for argument is cutaway, and it must be readily admitted that no course more calculated to attain that end could have been selected than that of bringing on a quarrel with this country.</p>
<p>But disregarding the insinuation that a policy so tortuous underlies the conduct of the advisers of Mr. Lincoln, and assuming that the object of the Federal Government is the rehabilitation of the Union, it is impossible not to see the instantaneous damage that would be done to that object if war with England comes to pass. Already we see in the message of Mr. Jefferson Davis indications of the effect which such a dispute would have on the fortunes of the party of which he is the head. His bold assertion of a violation of international law in the case of the Trent is pregnant with suggestion, and its interpretation is that he sees in that act a near prospect of the recognition of the Southern States as an independent Republic by one of the first Powers of Europe. Of the moral force of such a declaration on the cause of which he is the apostle there can be little doubt; but if the matter should come to positive hostilities a glance will suffice to show, in the first place, the whole Southern seaboard practically set free from blockade, the cotton trade in full operation, under the practical convoy of the fleets of England, with a corresponding financial effect on the resources of that part of the American continent; while, on the other hand, the ports of the North will be fast closed, and an equivalent check placed on the commerce and sources of strength and action of the Federal power. This is no idle boast or senseless assertion, for we have the ships, the guns, and, above all, at this juncture of our naval history, we are strong just where we have hitherto been weak; we have the men, the sailors, without whom all the, vessels of war in the world would be inert masses. Already there comes from the great emporiums of trade and commerce, from New York notably, the rumour of mercantile stagnation, and, worse still, the cry of popular distress. Civil war alone has sown the seeds of paralysis in that national prosperity of which Americans were so justly proud, and in the most fortunate future looms a large national debt and years of financial struggle. What may not be predicated as the result of a war with a powerful kingdom like England, added to the internecine strife which is now going on in the States? In the interests of humanity and of civilisation and progress one shrinks from the contemplation of the rebound of a quarter of a century of a nation which, always a world's wonder, possessed within it so many of the elements of advancement to greatness.</p>
<p>Nor, in considering the consequences of an unfriendly termination of the differences between England and the Federal States, can the probable conduct of other nations in Europe be placed out of sight. In the very first rank, of course, must be placed France; and, if the opinions of the Imperial Government be at all truly indicated, there is little doubt of the line which will be taken by that country. If the arguments of the French journals-even those which, as the phrase goes, are "inspired" from the highest quarters-mean anything, they mean that this question is not to be looked at from a merely English point of view at all. It is stated that it is only an accident that the Confederate Commissioners were seized under the British flag; for, supposing they had found it convenient to take passage in a French vessel, the officers of the San Jacinto would have felt themselves equally bound to have captured them under the tricolor. In fact, it is urged that the question is a purely international one, and one on which it is impossible but that the opinion of all the nations of Europe must be consentaneous. The <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> and its immediate vindication rest on England, but the moral force of international opinion will also be brought to bear on the quarrel, and that in direct opposition to the American side of the question. These considerations take the matter wholly out of the comparatively narrow bounds of a captious dispute between England and the Federal States. The question becomes cosmopolitan, and its bearings and its consequences assume adequate proportions.</p>
<p>If something of all this, which we have, owing to an earnest desire to enter on the discussion with the utmost moderation, perhaps too faintly indicated, could present itself to the American as it most surely does to the English mind, we might yet see a satifactory, because a peaceful, solution of this vexed question. England, resolute and prepared for any eventualility, but more in sorrow than in anger, demands reparation for an international as well as a national wrong. If she had any choice she would have preferred that any other State of Europe should have undertaken the vindication of a principle which she holds only in common with other nations. There are special reasons too obvious and too often dwelt upon which make a quarrel of this kind in the abstract distasteful to her. She does not forget "that blood is thicker than water," but she also remembers that the time has been when in a contest for high principles and rights she could bear to see conflict even between brother and brother on her own soil, and, grievous as was the sacrifice, it was a lustration from which she did not shrink. She wishes to shed no kinsman's blood now: let us hope that that feeling will prove to be reciprocal.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS, OF THE SAN JACINTO.</p>

<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">APTAIN</hi> C<hi rend="smallcaps">HARLES</hi> W<hi rend="smallcaps">ILKS</hi>, the hero of the hour in the United States, was born in the State of New York in 1805, and entered the United States' Navy in 1818. In 1838 he was commissioned by the Federal Government, with the grade of Captain, to take command of a naval expedition to explore the countries bordering on the Pacific and Southern Oceans. Starting from New York, he doubled Cape horn, visited the Sandwich, Feejee, and other Polynesian groups, and the coast of Oregon; crossed over to Australia and Tasmania, decending as low as the 61st degree of south latitude. He visited Singapore and Borneo, and returned to New York in 1842, by way of time Cape of Good Hope. Several courts-martial were held upon him, from which, however, he issued without loss of rank. The results of his expedition were recounted in a voluminous illustrated work entitled "A Narrative of the United States' Exploring Expedition." In 1848 the Geographical Society of London presented him with a gold medal as a token of their appreciation of his services to science. He has since published a work entitled "Western America," which contains statistical and geographical facts and maps relating to the States of the Pacific Coast. He was returning from the coast of Africa, in command of the San Jacinto, when, hearing at Havannah that the Confederate Coinmissioners intended to take passage in the steamer Trent, he determined to seize them and any despatches they might have with them. In acting as he did he states that he was guided only by his own notions of his duty to his country, and that he had no instructions from his superiors at Washington.</p>
 
<p rend="center">THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CONFEDERATE<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps"> STATES.</hi></p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> our Issue of this week we give Portraits of Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell, the Commissioners of the Southern Stats of America, who were arrested by the officers of the San Jacinto on board the British mail-steamer Trent.</p>

<p rend="smallcaps">MR. MASON.</p>
<p>This gentleman, the Commissioner to England, is a native of the State of Virginia, and is of direct English descent, this fact of lineage having been always held traditionally in his family. He is the grandson of George Mason, one of the most celebrated of the worthies of Virginia, who was the framer and chief supporter of the first Constitution or that State. The subject of our present memoir was born in the latter part of the last century, and made his first appearance in public life in 1823, as a member of a Convention of the Southern States which was assembled for the purpose of carrying our a favourite plan of Washington for opening up the resources of Virginia by means of a canal between the Ohio and the Chesapeake Rivers. In 1827 he was a member of a Convention under whose auspices the old Constitution of the State of Virginia was altered. In 1846 he was elected to the Senate of the United States, and was afterwards rechosen at every election almost without opposition. Immediately on his becoming a Senator he was appointed a member of that important section of the Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee, which position he held without interruption until his retirement from that body, and he was for more than ten years the chairmmman of that Committee. In 1850 he took part in the discussion which ended in California being declared a Free State, and was one of the seven or eight members who, in conjunction with Mr. Jefferson Davis, was in favour of terminating the Convention of the Southern States with the Federal system by their withdrawal from the Union. In politics Mr. Mason has always been a consistent Democrat. He married the daughter of Mr. Benjamin Chew, a member of a family of some consideration in the State of Pennsylvania. Although not endowed with any remarkable energy or brilliancy, Mr. Mason has always shown capacity for affairs; while on his personal character as a gentleman of high honour and elevated sentiments no slur has ever been attempted to be cast.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SLIDELL.</p>
<p>Mr. Slidell, the Commissioner to France, was born in the city of New York, and the date of his birth also belongs to the last century. At a comparatively late period of life he commenced the study of the law, and, having formally embraced the legal profession, he removed to New Orleans, where he practised with great success and accumulated a large fortune by the exercise of  his ability and industry, which, combined with great energy of character, have always caused him to hold a prominent position in public life. He married the accomplished daughter of a gentleman of Louisiana, the lady who accompanied him in his voyage towards Europe was present at his capture on board the Trent, and is now residing in this country. Under the presidency of General Jackson he was appointed District Attorney for the State of Louisiana. He was subsequently elected to Congress for two terms, and served the first, but before the second had expired he was selected as the head of the mission to Mexico, and continued Minister for the United States in that country until war was declared. In 1853 he was elected a member of the Senate of the United States, and occupied that position until the secession of the Southern States. It should be mentioned that when Mr. Buchanan became President he was desirous of obtaining the services of Mr. Slidell in his Cabinet, and placed any office which might suit his views at his disposal, but that offer was not accepted. Afterwards the acceptance of more than one foreign mission was pressed on Mr. Slidell, and especially the post of United States' Minister to France, but these distinctions he also declined.</p>

<p>At the auction-rooms in the Rue Drouot, Paris, a few days back, three very small vases for flowers, in old sevres porcelain, and decorated in the style of the eighteenth century, were sold for 15,950f.</p>

<p>The gold medals of the Royal Academy for the year were on Tuesday awarded as follows:-To Andrew Brown Donaldson, for the best historical painting; to George Slater, for the best historical group in sculpture; and to Thomas Henry Watson, for the best architectural design.</p>

<p>Tuesday's <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> contains a number of regulations, agreed to by the International Commission, for the regulation of the navigation of the Lower Danube. The provisions are very minute, and show the care that the commissioners have bestowed on the subject.</p>

<p>The Europa, which took out the instructions to Lord Lyons on the subject of the Trent steamer, left Queenstown on the 1st inst. for Halifax; and the Federal Government most probably knew the nature of those instructions on Wednesday or Thursday. The following are the steamers which will bring important news from America subsequently to the receipt of the instructions in Washington, via -The Canada will leave Boston on the 11th, call off Cape Race for news on the 13th, and reach Queenstown on the 22nd. The North American will leave Portland on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 15th, and reach Londonderry on the 23rd. The City of Baltimore will leave New York on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach Queenstown on the 24th. The Bavaria will leave New York on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach Cowes on the 26th. The Africa will leave New York on the 18th, call off Cape Race on the 20th, and reach Queenstown on the 30th.</p>

<p>General Scott has left for America. It is asserted that his departure took place in consequence of an urgent despatch from the Washington Cabinet.</p>

<p>GARRISON OF QUEBEC.-An American paper says:- "Taking Quebec garrisons and the Upper Town into just consideration, it may be deemed one vast fortress-cannon, soldier, shot, and shell meeting you at every turn. Even old cannon are used as posts in common in Upper Town. It is to all intents and purposes a complete fortification, and to have a just perception of its strength and impregnability it must be seen. The militia of Quebec, like the militia throughout Canada are continually drilling."</p>
