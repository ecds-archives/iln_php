<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">REVIOUS</hi> Numbers of this Journal have contained some particulars of the unsuccessful attempt of Stone's and Bank's columns to effect a landing on the 21st ult, on the Virginian Shore of the Upper Potomac, near Leesburg; and we now give two Illustrations, from Sketches by our Special Artist, in connection with this seemingly mad enterprise on the part of the Federal forces. The whole affair appears to have been ill-planned and adds another to the grievous blunders committed by the Federal commanders. It is hardly credible that 1800 men should have been sent across a river in the face of an enemy most strongly posted, and left unsupported when 30,000 of the division to which they belonged were within sound of their rifles. The small body, however, fought gallantly throughout the day against three times their number. One incident of the fight-a desperate effort made by the 15th Massachusetts Regiment to clear the woods by a bayonet charge-is Illustrated on our first page. This is believed to be the only instance in which a bayonet charge has been attempted by a regiment in the Federal army. The 15th Massachusetts fought most gallantly throughout the whole affair, although they knew the odds to be greatly against them; and the example set by their officers, mostly students from Harvard College, Cambridge, was most praiseworthy. Their efforts, however, were not crowned with success, as the deadly fire of the Mississippi riflemen drove them back each time; and, as evening drew on, seeing the utter uselessness of contending against their powerful enemy, the few surviving combatants slowly fell back to the river-side with but two line officers remaining. In the endeavour to recross to the island, midway between the Maryland and Virginian shoress, from which they had started, the general organisation of the force was quite abandoned, each company acting separately. The officers and men who could swim started, half naked, over the river, and the boats were kept awhile for the wounded. This, however lasted but a little time. All order was quickly lost. A large flat boat was sunk by overcrowding, and scores of men perished, some by drowning and some by the fire of the Confederates, who now crowded the high bank and poured an incessant fire upon the scattering fugitives. The river channel was thickly strewed with the dead and dying, but the bearing of the survivors is reported to have been strangely quiet-the immobility, perhaps of desperate hopelessness. Hundreds, probably, were here sacrificed. This much is certain, that out of the 1800 who landed scarcely 600 returned. The retreat of the Federalists forms the subject of the accompanying Engraving.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 23, 1861.</p>

<p>T<hi redn="smallcaps">HE</hi> fearful storms which have raged on the eastern coast of North America have acquired a strange and almost ghastly interest for the North and South. The magnificently-described Armada that had sailed to deal the accumulated vengeance of the Federalists upon the Confederates had, it was thought, steered into the very heart of the tempest. The most opposite passions were aroused, and while the Northerners were praying that the armament to which the honour of the Union had been so solemnly confided might escape the fury of the elements the fiercer prayers of the South went up for its destruction- a result which the terrible character of the storms made painfully probable. We are told that it is almost certain that the fleet has been preserved; and we may hear at once that it has not only been saved, but has delivered its blow at Charleston or elsewhere. Meantime affairs on land have assumed a perplexing, not to say menacing, character. It was finally decided to remove General Fremont from his command, and the order came suddenly down to his camp, together with the journals which made the fact public. A mutiny of the gravest kind instantly showed itself. We say of the gravest kind, because the principal actors were not from the rank and file, but were officers, whose first duty was subordination, and who set the fatal example of declaring that they would not serve except under the General whose somewhat melodramatic faults seem to have endeared him to the forces lately under his command. General Fremont himself had to appeal to their sense of duty to the Republic; and it would appear that a sullen acquiescence was obtained, and that they will condescend to fight under the new leader appointed by the authorities. This may all augur ill for operations in that quarter. An American writer who has been narrowly inspecting the army of the North draws so unfavourable a picture of its discipline, cleanliness, and soldierly bearing as makes the English reports appear almost complimentary. But, in the face of all, Secretary Cameron announces to the nation that the day of reverses is over, and that the Union is now about to proceed from triumph to triumph. More to the purpose, it is distinctly stated that not only is the abolition of Southern slavery entirety out of the plans of the North, but that slaves who may be used by the army of the Federalists shall, if they belong to loyal owners, be paid for just as if they had been mules or any other article required for the campaign. This may be regarded as a provisional olive-branch held out to smooth matters in the event of a Northern success making a compromise possible. The Abolition party are enraged beyond measure, and their demonstrations are formidable. Meantime the usual raving of the ribald press is launched against England; and we are told that ours is a "Puritan and blackleg Cabinet," that the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> is the accepted organ of the English Tories (which may be news to our contemporary), and that as soon as ever the war is over " such a train of disasters" shall be inflicted upon England as shall make her rue the day when she dared to say that ten millions of Americans were belligerents instead of rebels. It is impossible to believe that such rabid rant and utter nonsense can have weight with educated Americans; but why is it tolerated by authorities that have and use power to suppress a journal for only expressing a wish for peace?...</p>
<p>The Americans, who profess themselves so enchanted at the sympathies of the Czar, and who half menace us and France with a Russo-American crusade, will have some few sacrifices to make in the matter of civilisation when the proposed coalition takes place. They open private letters, imprison suspected persons, put down journals, and clamour for hanging spies, but they have not attained the point of tying up women and flogging them for Southern proclivities, though, if it be true, as stated, that "the ladies of the North are all for the Southrons," there is no saying what the New York press may not recommend as "vigour of action."</p>

<p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">EW</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">DELPHI</hi>.-The long-announced production or "The Octoroon," the new sensation drama by Mr. Boucicault, took place on Monday before a crowded audience which filled the house to the ceiling. The scene is in Louisiana, where the Octoroon, or "eighth blood," is not allowed by law to marry with a white person; and the interest of the plot is based on this circumstance. Zoe, the natural daughter of Judge Peyton, has been reared in luxury but not fully emancipated, and on the death of her father is exposed to the machinations of a rascally overseer, Jacob M'Closkey (Mr. Emery), who, having mismanaged the estate, has an interest in forcing on its sale, with the slaves belonging to it, that he may purchase Zoe, and subdue her to his unwelcome passion. George Peyton, the nephew of the Judge and heir to the property (Mr. Billington), seeks naturally to avoid the sale, and expects daily a remittance from Liverpool sufficient to satisfy all demands. M'Closkey takes measures to prevent the packet from reaching his hands in time, in consequence of which the slaves are sold. A slave auction accordingly forms the grand sensation scene of the drama, which is conducted with all the formalities accompanying such transactions in Southern America, and forms a most exciting tableau. M'Closkey outbids all intending purchasers for the fair Octoroon, and  becomes her possessor. But, in his attempt to retard the delivery of the letter to Peyton, he has incurred a guilt for which he is destined to punishment. He has murdered a negro lad who was in charge of the post-bag; and a picture of the act has been accidentally taken by a photographic machine which was being worked in the vicinity. He falls into the clutches of Lyncn law, and is confined on board a steamer pending his execution. To effect his escape he hurls a lantern among some tar-barrels, and thus causes an explosion. But an avenging Indian is on his track, and slays him on the grave of the poor negro whom he had murdered. And all might now be well, but that Zoe, ignorant of these facts, has taken poison in despair. The drama is placed on the stage with all the accessories that can conduce to a great and marked success, and is illustrated with local scenery of great beauty. The composition itself is distinguished by a lightness and elegance of touch which compensates for whatever is revolting in the action. The whole was capitally performed. Mr. Emery was remarkably impressive in M'Closkey, and Mr. Boucicault as tim Yankee overseer, who afterwards turns photographer, was characteristically made up, and sustained his part with great humour. Mrs. Boucicault, as the heroine, excited so much interest that the audience were scarcely reconciled to her failing a victim in order to point more effectually the moral of the drama. We certainly recognise no aesthetic necessity for such a d&Eacute:nouement, but rather the contrary, and think that the author would have found his account in a happier ending. Mr. Billington, as the hero, was pathetic and gentlemenly; and the other parts were well supported, particularly that of an old negro, by Mr. George Jamison, and that of the Indian, by Mr. Phillips. The female parts, also, were well filled by Mrs. Marston and Miss Latimer. Miss Clara Denvil, as the poor murdered negro-lad, acted with her usual grace and spirit The success of the piece was decided.</p>

Captain Nelson, of the Harvey Birch, reports having left havre on Saturday last, the 17th inst., bound for New York, in ballast. On the 19th inst., when in lat. 42 deg. 6 min. N., long. 9 deg. 52 min. W., she was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagrim, late of the United States' navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who at once ordered the captain and crew on board the steamer, allowing them to take a few of their effects and fresh provisions. Captain Peagrim then ordered the Harvey Birch to be fired, and laid alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge. Captain Nelson is just landed with his crew and officers, twenty-nine in all, and has immediattely placed himself in communication with Captain Britton, the United States' Consul at this port. The Nashville is still lying in the river, flying the Southern Confederate flag. Captain Nelson says that Commander Peagrim states he has no commission from the Southern Government as a war-steamer, and yet declares he is not a privateer. No Southern Commissioners have arrived by the Nashville. There are, however, on board a Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton appears to have some commission to execute, as he proceeds to London immediately. The Nashville has experienced very bad weather since running the blockade at Charleston. Her crew consists of English and Irish, who, after shipment, were compelled to sign other articles. The whole of the crew of the Harvey Birch, with the exception of Captain Nelson and his two officers, were placed in irons until arriving here. Captain Peagrim endeavoured to make Captain Nelson and his crew take an oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government. Captain Peagrim has communicated with Mr. Yancey."</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has become a question whether there is any design in both or either of the contending parties in the States of America to obtain from Great Britain, in a certain sense involuntarily,that which would amount to a violation of neutrality. It is well known that there has been, and probably there still is, an irritability among the more sensitive spirits of the Federal States against England on account of the decided principles of non-intervention in this terrible quarrel which have been laid down by our statesmen and universally acquiesced in by our people. What was expected of this country in such a juncture of American affairs as now exists does not very clearly appear; but of the fact that dissatisfaction with the conduct of England prevails to a considerable extent in the Northern States there is no doubt. Of the feeling towards this country in the Southern States we have little or no knowledge; but there have been rumours, the effect of which is that the Confederates believe that, in our secret hearts, our leaning is to

</p><pb n="536">
their Side, and that our sympathies are, so to speak, wrapped up in cotton. So much of our prosperity, and of the welfare of a large part of our population, is supposed, not without reason, to depend on our import of an article of which in our markets the South has hitherto enjoyed a practical monopoly, that it has been whispered that the Confederate leaders had determined not to allow the export of any cotton to this country under any circumstances, and even apart from the restriction of a blockade, in the hope that England would yield to a commercial pressure, which might easily be converted into a social disturbance, and take such steps as would in effect cause her to do something more than lean to the party of the Secessionists. It would scarcely be denied, even in America itself-certainly not in the Southern States-that even a show of partisanship on the part of England would throw a heavy weight into the scale against the party which she discountenanced; and, however any such idea may be disavowed, it is more than probable that either section would be glad to test the real feeling of this country and the absolute soundness of the neutrality which she professes. Circumstances have just occurred which, as we conceive, will tend to bring about a settlement of any doubts which may exist in regard to this question. Far be it from us to insinuate anything which can be construed into even a tendency to offence to either party in this unhappy contest, but we may be permitted to say that it has long been the boast of the Americans as a people that they are essentially what they call "smart;" and, among other additions to the language which is common to the Old and the New Country which they have succeeded in making is the word "dodge"-the significancy of which is admitted. Of course, the word could not exist unless that which it signifies also existed; and that its application should creep into the conduct of the public affairs of the States, Federal or Confederate, at a critical moment, and when a great object was at stake, would not be in the least surprising.</p>

<p>These remarks have been elicited by the fact that armed vessels, both of the Federal and Confederate States, have made their appearance at one of our principal ports, and have demanded that aid, in the shape of opportunities and facilities for refitting, which, by the permission of the Sovereign, any State is accustomed to afford to the war-vessels of all nations. In the cave of the Federal vessel, whatever may have been her objects or her destination, she bore with her no distinctive marks of those qualities which would have brought her within the terms of the declaration of neutrality which has been solemnly enuticiated to the contending parties in America by the Government of this country. In that declaration it is laid down that her Majesty and all her subjects will "hold a strict and impartial neutrality between the Government of the United States of America and certain States styling themselves the Confederate States of America." The subjects of this realm are warned against adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties; and an interdict has been laid on the armed ships, and also the privateers of both parties, from carrying prizes made by them into the ports of the United Kingdom or of any of her Majesty's possessions. Sinning overtly against none of these provisions, the James Adger-Federalist-got what she required at Southampton, and in due time departed from that port, whither and for what immediate purposes we were bound by the letter of international law not too curiously to inquire. Hardly had the Federal flag disappeared from our waters when the Confederate colours floated in the same harbour, also over an armed ship, coming, avowedly, for the purpose of refitting. But here the parallel ceases. Without any attempt at disguise, but, as far as we can judge, with ostentatious frankness, it is made known by the commander of the Nashville that almost, if not entirely, in British waters, he had captured and burnt a trading vessel belonging to adherents of the Federal party, made prisoners of the crew, and brought them to England in irons; this latter course having been taken because they declined to enter the Confederate service.</p>
<p>So much of the well-known facts connected with the Nashville it has been necessary to state in order to justify the supposition which we venture to lay down, that the whole proceeding, from first to last, was carried on with the design of bringing to the test the question of British neutrality. It would seem as if this merchantman in ballast was taken and destroyed by a Confederate ship of war with the object of exhibiting the character of the latter openly before the eyes of the English Government, and coming, as it were, red-handed, from the destruction of a Federal vessel, she enters an English port, and asks aid and assistance in rendering her complete and efficient, and enabled to proceed on a cruise in which, of course she expects to meet with other vessels belonging to her enemies and to deal with them in the same manner as she treated the Harvey Birch. It is true that she brought no prize into a British port; but she brought with her all the symbols and signs of a prize. Indeed, she retains property on board of her belonging to the captain and passengers of the captured, for the recovery of which these latter have endeavoured to invoke the help of English law. Can it be denied that, if permission were given to the Nashville to refit and repair, it would be a violation of the spirit, if not of the letter-and even this distinction is by no means clear-of that part of the Queen's declaration which forbids "the adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties?" No doubt the technical answer to this assertion is, that these words apply only to matters which are called contraband of war. But the real question is, how would such an act as the aiding and comforting-to use an old legal word- of this Confederate vessel, fresh from the capture of a Federal vessel, he construed by the authorities and the people of the North; and, if the truth were known, does not the Captain of the Nashville know that it would be construed in a hostile sense; and is not that the very reason why he has brought his ship, with the crew of her prize, into Southampton harbour?</p>

<p>Something might be said of the "prononc&eacute:" manner in which a Confederate agent who has come to England in the Nashville-of whom and of his mission we say nothing-has talked of the vast quantities of cotton which are lying ready for shipment in the Southern States, and which, of course, only await some contingency which would break up or render ineffective the Federal blockade. This matter, small in itself, is sufficiently suggestive, and is not without significance in arguing the view we have taken in reference to this transaction.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that we are discussing this question, not in any spirit of partisanship or with any tendency of feeling or opinion towards either party in the United States, but solely, as it stands, as a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the Government of this country in carrying out that principle of neutrality which has been laid down as our rule of action. In that sense, and considering the question only from that point of view in coming to a conclusion, it seems to us that the observance of pure and unadulterated neutrality demands that no assistance should be given to the Nashville. Admitting that all which we have suggested of a crafty device having been adopted in order to embroil this country with the Federal Government to be without foundation, and indeed we did not for a moment mean to insinuate that it should enter into the consideration of the Government in practically dealing with the matter, on the true construction of our declaration of rigid non-intervention, and, still more, on the principle of sound policy, the usual accommodation and appliances which are granted to ships of war in our ports ought to be withheld from this Confederate vessel of war presenting herself under her peculiar circumstances to the notice of the English authorities.</p>

<p>We have waited in vain up to the moment at which we are writing for the decision of her Majesty's Government on this subject. For all that has hitherto appeared the affair of the Nashville remains unsettled. It is certain that some definite and unmistakable rule which would include just such circumstances as those which surround the case of the Confederate ship ought to have been immediately promulgated by the Government, so that there might be no mistake as to the conditions on which armed vessels of either belligerent are henceforth to be allowed to enter British harbours, and as to the rights which they are to enjoy whilst they remain in harbour. It is true that a still more important event may bring the question of the relations which are to exist between this country and the Federals into a condition of exactitude; but it is just possible that the acts of the Commander of the San Jacinto to our mailsteamer Trent may not lead to hostilities between the two countries, and in that case the necessity for accurate and unmistakable rules of neutrality will be more than ever needed.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> greatest excitement prevailed at Southampton last Thursday week by the arrival in the waters there of a large paddle-sloop of war, with pennant, and flying the Confederate flag of America. She proved to be the Nashville, Captain Peagrim, which ran the blockade at Charleston on the 26th of October last; and on her coming to anchor there landed from her, with their personal effects, the crew (twenty-nine in number) of the late American slip Harvey Birch. This latter was a full-rigged vessel of 1500 tons burden, cost 150,000 dollars, and was bound from Havre to New York in ballast, but fallen in with by the Nashville on the morning of Tuesday, the 19th inst., and by her captured and destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The following is the statement of her commander, Captain W. H. Nelson:- The American ship Harvey Birch, of New York, left Havre on Saturday, the 17th inst., bound to New York, in ballast; when in lat 49.6 N., long. 9.52 W., was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagram, late of the United States' Navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who were at once ordered on board the Confederate steamer, allowing Captain Nelson and crew to take a few of their effects and some fresh provisions. The Harvey Birch was then ordered to to fired by Commander Peagrim, who remained alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o'clock the Nashville arrived off the entrance of the docks, and at one p.m. was moored alongside the north jetty, which was literally besieged with spectators. She brought as passengers, under orders of the Hon. the Secretary of the Navy, Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton is on special duty for the State of North Carolina, and, notwithstanding the length of the voyage and the heavy weather experienced throughout her passage, which carried away portions of her paddle-boxes. &c., they are in good health. He says that there are 750,000 bales of cotton of the old crop, and over 4,000,000 bales of the new crop, and 50,000,000 dols.' worth of tobacco and naval stores ready for shipment.</p>

<p>Captain Peagrim is an old officer of the United States' Navy, and bore a conspicuous part in the Mexican War, in the Paraguay and Japan expeditions, and during the war waged by the English and French in China. For his distinguished services his native State of Virginia voted him, by the unanimous voice of the General Assembly of the Legislature, a splendid sword, and Sir John Stirling, in his despatches to the Admiralty, makes the following mention of him:- "It is impossible to speak too highly of the American co-operating party engaged. They were with the Rattler, emulating each other in the thickest of the attack. But my warmest thanks in particular are due to Lieutenant Peagrim, the American senior officer: his encouragement of the men, and coolness under a heavy fire, and determined bravery, when surrounded by a persevering and revengeful foe, was conspicuous to all." First Lieutenant Fauntleroy was Aide-de-Camp to General Johnson at the battle of Manassas. Second Lieutenant Bennett served there in the naval battery, while one youngster on board named Cary received his appointment as midshipman in the Confederate navy as a reward for distinguished gallantry in the same action. The remainder of her company, chiefly Scotch and Irish, consists of two mates, eight midshipmen, paymaster, surgeon, engineer, and staff; firemen, coaltrimmers, and crew, amounting in all to some sixty men.</p>

<p>The Nashville does not carry a very formidable armament, having only two English 12-pounder rifled guns, of Captain Blakeley's manufacture. She is of 1100 tons burden and 800-horse power, and was built for the passenger and coasting trade between New York and Charleston. Though by no means qualified to make a thoroughly efficient ship-of-war, she is superior to many that have been adopted into the service of the belligerents. Like most American passenger-steamers, she is fitted with a deckhouse and hurricane-deck, which would have to be removed before she could he made to answer even tolerably as a gun-boat. Her paddle-wheels are, of course, a great drawback to her utility for actual warfare, while her machinery, being scarcely below the level of the deck, would, in all probability, be disabled by the first shot. She is a good model, and, in smooth water and proper trim, her speed is over fifteen knots an hour. In spite of her top-hamper the officers speak of her qualities as a seaboat, and of her performance during a succession of heavy gales, in terms of the highest praise. She is sister ship to the James Adger, Federal war-sloop, of eight guns.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Europa we are in receipt of papers to the 13th

and telegrams to the 15th, inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CAPTURE OF BEAUFORT.</p>

<p>Of the eighty-four transports and war-vessels which constituted the naval expedition when it set sail from Hampton Roads seventy-five arrived safely in the harbour of Port Royal, on the coast of South Carolina, about midway between Charleston and Savannah. The bombardment commenced on the 7th inst., and, after a fight of four hours, the Confederates abandoned the forts at the entrance to the inlet, and retreated precipitately. The Federals captured two forts, forty-three guns, military equipments, charts, and other valuable papers. The Confederates complain that their artillery was badly served, while that of their enemies was ably handled. The Federals in the attack lost only one gun-boat, whose hands were all saved. On the following day the Federal army, numbering 15,000 men, landed and established themselves at Beaufort, the seaside resort of the platers. The settlement, together with the neighbouring plantations, had been totally destroyed by the Confederates. Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp. The loss of life seems to have been small. The Federals set down their loss at eight; that of the Confederates is loosely estimated at a hundred. The small fleet of the Confederates, commanded by Commodore Tatnall, took no part in the action. Many of them escaped up the inlet leading to the Savannah river, others were run ashore, and the remainder were intercepted by the Federal vessels. Of the nine Federal vessels which were disabled en route, seven returned to Fortress Monroe, and two were wrecked on the coast of North Carolina. One of these contained ordnance stores, the other, troops to the number of 75 (who were taken prisoner) and horses, of whom all were lost except 15.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND</p>

<p>In Western Virginia the town of Guyandotte, on the Ohio River, was attacked by 600 Confederates, and, out of 150 Union troops stationed there, 100 were either killed or taken prisoners. The Confederates then retreated, when a loyal regiment retook the town and set fire to it, reducing the greater part to ashes.</p>

<p>At Piketown, the capital of Pike county, Kentucky, the easternmost county in the State, General Nelson (Federal) defeated General Williams's forces and took their leaders prisoners, The Secessionists lost 400 killed and a large number of prisoners.</p>

<p>A battle took place in Missouri on the 7th, of which the accounts are very unsatisfactory. It appears that an expedition left the Federal camp at Cairo, Illinois, and landed at Belmont, in Missouri, nearly opposite Columbia. The expedition numbered about 3500 men, and made an attack on a Confederate camp, numbering, they say, 7000. The enuny were driven out of their entrenchments, and their camp destroyed. As the Federals were retiring, booty laden, they were taken in the rear by a body of Confederates and compelled to retreat to their boats, leaving their booty to the enemy. The Federals admit a  loss of from 300 to 500 in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>The army of the West has not advanced beyond Springfield. General Halleck, of California, hss been appointed to command it. He is one of the four Major-Generals of the regular army of the United States. He entered the army in 1839, and is now about forty-two years of age. He has written two works on military matters, and till recently was practising law in San Francisco. General Fremont, on his return to St. Louis, received an ovation from the Germans of that city.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOUTHERN COAST.</p>

<p>The late gale, in which the North Briton was lost, raged with almost unexampled severity at Hatteras Inlet, and the high tide had overflowed the space outside the forts to such an extent that a new channel was being formed between them. It was apprehended that the forts might thus be rendered untenable. Some clothing and stores taken down from Fortress Monroe for the use of the Indiana regiment stationed there were washed away, after being landed, and lost. The ocamp of this regiment was submerged and everything it contained washed away. The regiment has since been brought back to Monroe. Much sickness prevails among the occupying force on hatteras.</p>

<p>The Southern journals report the arrival of the Confederate steamer Theodora at Savannah with a valuable cargo of stores.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda escaped from Charleston with a cargo of rosin and turpentine and 2000 bales of cotton. She was permitted to take a cargo of cotton as a mark of gratitude for the valuable supply of arms and ammunition she had brought; but, as a general rule, ships running the blockade for Europe are not allowed by the people to take cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis and Vice-President Stephens have been re-elected to the positions they now severally occupy.</p>

<p>Judah P. Benjamin has been appointed Secretary for War.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEFENCE OF THE COASTS.</p>

<p>Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, has written a caustic reply to Mr. Seward's circular letter. He objects to corresponding by slips cut from newspapers; he is surprised that the late Congress was not solicited to pass appropriations for this purpose if things were more menacing then than now. He says that he does not feel himself justified in calling a special Session of the State Legislature, while Congress will reassemble a month before the regular Session of the fotmer body. The whole subject of coast defences could only be dealt with by the general Government. Even if the States were to undertake the job, the competition in the money markets for loans between the nation and the States would be very injurious to both. Pennsylvania had already advanced considerable sums for raising volunteers, and the Federal Government had thrown great difficulties in the way of repayment. On the whole, he suggests the abandonment of Mr. Seward's plan.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The captain of the slaver Erie had been convicted of the capital offence by a New York jury. This is remarkable as being the only conviction of the kind since 1820 when the traffic was declared piracy by Congress. Another trial for a similar crime is progressing in New Bedford.</p>

<p>In New Jersey the Democratic party had carried the State. In Maryland the Union ticket prevailed. To this result the surveillance exercised over the polls by General Dix's troops greatly contributed.</p>
<p>A memorial was in circulation in St. Louis, asking Congress to relieve Missouri from the national taxes, because her citizens have already suffered so seriously from the war.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuters's office yesterday (Friday):-</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the Steamer City of New York, which arrived at Queenstown on Thursday, we have intelligence from New York to the 15th inst:-</p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence of the occupation of Beaufort by the Federals. The Charleston papers of the 12th inst. deny that the Federals have occupied the town, and state that reinforcements had been sent thither by the Confederates who were preparing to defend the town. The Federals, however, have occupied Hilton Island, the cotton crop on which was found to have been fired by the residents before leaving. The <hi rend="italics">Charleston Courier</hi> says there is little cotton stored at or near Beaufort. The New York journals state that the Federal Government has not determined whether Beaufort shall be made a port of entry. The Southern journals state that black flags have been hoisted at Charleston and Savannah as an indication that no quarter would be given and that none would be asked.</p>

<p>Eighteen Federal officers, prisoners of war at Richmond, have been selected to be hung, should the Federal Government hang the crew of the privateer Savannah.</p>

<p>Confirmatory accounts have been received of bridge-burning on a most extensive scale by the Union men of East Tennessee, Missouri.</p>

<p>The Federal army has evacuated Springfield, Missouri, returning to St. Louis.</p>

<p>It is reported that a United States' war-vessel has captured a large British steamer, supposed to be the Fingal, laden with arms, at Key West.</p>

<p>Colonel Cochrane, in addressing his regiment at Washington, urged the arming of the Southern slaves against their masters. The Secretary for War was present on the occasion, and is reported to have fully endorsed Colonel Cochrane's speech.</p>

<p>A despatch from Fortress Monroe reports the arrival of the United States' steam-sloop-of-war San Jacinto, with Messrs. Slidell and Mason on board.</p>

<p>The reported battle at Pikeville, Kentucky, was very much exaggerated. There were no killed, and the number of wounded and prisoners is reduced to 80 and 50 respectively.</p>

<p>The report of the capture of the Sumter has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">TARTLING</hi> news has been brought by the West Indian mail steamer La Plata, which arrived at Southampton on Wednesday. On the 8th inst. Mr. Slidell, the accredited commissioner to France from the Confederate States, and Mr. Mason, engaged on a similar mission to France, with their respective secretaries, Messrs. Eustis and M'Farland-who had run the blockade at Charleston and arrived at Havannah on the 18th ult., were forcibly taken out of the British mail-steamer Trent by the commander of the American steam-frigate San Jacinto.</p>

<p>It appears that on the 7th inst. the Trent sailed in her regular course of service from Havnnah for St. Thomas. On the following day, while the Trent was approaching a narrow passage in the Bahama Channel, a large steam-ship of war, which showed no colours, was seen waiting ahead. The Trent hoisted the British ensign, but elicited no responsive display of colours until she had approached within about 200 yards of the strange ship, which then fired a shot across the Trent's bow, hoisted the United States' flag, and fired a shell to leeward of the Trent. Captain Moir, the commander of the Trent, hailed the United States' steamer's captain, who replied that he wished to send a boat on board. A boat, containing two officers and ten men, boarded the Trent; and the boat's commanding officer, Lieutenant Fairfax, demanded to inspect the passenger-list, but was refused permission. He then declared that his commander, Captain Wilks, of the United States' steam-ship San Jacinto, had received information that Messrs. Shideil, Mason, Eustace, and M'Farland were among the passengers, and required that they should be given up to him. Captain Moir and Commander Williams, the naval officer in charge of the mails, refused to comply with the requisition; and the Confederate Commissioners, who were standing near, claimed the protection of the British flag under which they were sailing. Lieutenant Fairfax said he would take charge of the Trent, and made a signal to the San Jacinto, which immediately dispatched several armed boats, containing about 100 marines and seamen, who with drawn cutlasses boarded the Trent, arrested the Confederate Commissioners, and forced them into the boats. While this was doing, Commander Williams protested against the act in the following terms:-</p>

<quote rend="quoteblock">In this ship I am the representative of her Majesty'S Governmsnt, nd I call upon the officers of the ship and passengers generally to mark my words when, in the name of the British Government, and in distinct language, I denounce this as an illegal act, an act in violation of international law-an act, indeed, of wanton piracy, which, had we the means of defence, you would not dare to attempt.</quote>

<p>Mr. Slidell, as he was forced into the boat, requested the Trent's Captain to report exactly what had occurred, and declared that he looked to the British Government for redress for the outrage committed upon him while he was under the protection of the British flag. The American officers next complained that they were short of provisions, and asked for a supply for their prisoners, which was given by Captain Moir for the "exclusive use " of Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland. Lieutenant Fairfax said that he was ordered to take Captain Moir and his papers on board the San Jacinto; but Captain Moir refused to go unless he was forcibly removed from his quarterdeck. Lieutenant Fairfax thereupon told Captain Moir that he wanted nothing further, and ordered his men into the boats, which returned to the San Jacinto, leaving the Trent to prosecute her voyage.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 30, 1861.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has been for some time rumoured that a vessel of war bearing the flag of the Federal States of America was lying in the track of our West India mail-steamers with the intention of searching them for certain commissioners sent by the Confederate States to Europe. The statement was received with a good deal of incredulity, and the surprise and indignant feeling have been proportionably strong at the intelligence of the course pursued by the Commander of the San Jacinto towards the mail-packet Trent. Apart from the violation of right and the insult to the British flag which are necessarily involved in this transaction, there would appear to have been a savageness in the mode in which the proceedings were conducted, from which we are inclined to augur that the American officers were actuated by that feeling which generally induces persons who are doubtful whether they are in the right to overdo their parts. It is quite clear that it needed not the additional circumstances of ferocity implied in firing, first round shot and then shell, at an unarmed steamer, merely for the purpose of bringing her to; or the personal violence which is reported to have been used in the arrest of Mr. Slidell in particular, to elicit in a manner not to be mistaken the spirit of this country in regard to this proceeding. The most decided indications of public opinion have been afforded that England will not tamely submit to have her vessels boarded and passengers forcibly torn from beneath the protection of her flag. If, as has been asserted, it has been the object and design of the Federal Government to force Great Britain into an attitude of hostility, without question full reason and justification has been now afforded. Such an act, if done under the direct sanction and authority of the Executive at Washington, speaks for itself. Neither of the parties can desire a more complete "casus belli." It remains to be seen whether the proceedings of the commander of the San Jacinto will be adopted or disavowed by his Government. It is well known that American naval officers have been always somewhat hasty in asserting what they conceive to be the rights of their country; and in many cases it has been necessary on the part of those representatives of other countries with whom they have come into collision to exercise great forbearance. When the matter is looked at, considered with that coolness and calmness which its importance requires, it seems almost impossible to suppose that so flagrant a trespass on the rights which by international law are covered by a flag can have been deliberately planned by the American Government, or that when temperate but firm demands made for the disavowal of conduct on the face of it so unjustifiable on all grounds but one-that of seeking occasion for a quarrel-that disavowal will not be given. Notwithstanding the indignant feeling which has been evinced in this country on the receipt of this intelligence, there is no doubt that the gravity of the consequences which may ensue will be acknowledged by every Englishman. It is to be hoped that in the Northern States of America a corresponding feeling will prevail.</p>

<p>By the capture of Beaufort, the summer resort of Carolinian planters, the United States' Government have fully avenged the insult of Fort Sumter. In April the solo remiaining star-spangled banner on South Carolinian Soil was ignominiously lowered. In November the United States' flag has again been hoisted there, while that of the Confederates trails in the dust. But the war, in its ever-expanding magnitude, has long since outgrown the puerile issue on which it was commenced. The passionate resolve to redress an outrage inflicted on the Federal flag has long since deepened into a purpose of conquest. It would be a chimerical to hope that this success would tend to placate the North as that the forcible opening of a Southern port will lead to a renewal of the Southern trade with Europe.</p>

<p>This time, at least, the blow has fallen in the right place. Hitherto the border States-Maryland, Virginia (East and West), Kentucky, and Missouri-have alone felt the ravages which attend the shock of invading armies. Yet all these regions, except Eastern Virginia, are still in the Union. It has been the fate of the border Slave States to act as a sort of breakwater to the fury of the Northern storm behind which the revolutionary Gulf States dwelt in safety and comparative repose. On the Northern frontier of Secessia was the " shell" with which the far South incased its softer and more vital parts. All attempts to break through that shell by a front attack have hitherto failed. But the fleet has accomplished what the unaided army could not. South Carolina is the very heart and focus of the revolution, and the Isle of Anglesca of old was not more given up to Druidical worship than are the sea islands, on one of which the Federals are encamped, consecrated to slave-grown products. Negroes, rice, and the finest sorts of cotton-these are the pride and glory of Beaufort county, situated midway between Charleston and Savannah, the two principal southern ports on the Atlantic coast. Full five-sixths of the population of Beaufort county are slaves.</p>

<p>The angry North has at last condescended to carry the war into "Africa." In the border Slave States, where slavery is not of vigorous growth, the Administration and every General, except the deposed Fremont, have been sedulous to deprive the war of an anti-slavery character. But in this thickly-settled region, where slavery flourishes rankly, the Northern army of occupation must, in the very nature of things, and in spite even of the ingrained prejudices of the men composing it, become an instrument of emancipation. Already the telegraph tells us " Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp." These late chattels will not be restored to their owners. The Federal Government, which, in the border States, restores fugitives to "loyal" owners, rightly conjectures there are  no loyal proprietors in South Carolina, and at length allows its camp to be a gladsome City of Refuge to all who may flock thither. The slaves of this region, removed by a whole heaven from Canada, had no hope of escape from thraldom but death. A host of men from the North, contending for empire and a flag, but stung by the repulses at Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, suddenly appear in the midst of the negroes, consent to abandon their practice of slave-catching, and fastidiously resign themselves to the inevitable consequence that a chance of freedom will thereby be opened to a more or less numerous band of a downtrodden race. Had the midsummer cry of "Forward to Richmond!" availed we should never have heard of this autumnal invasion of the South Carolina coast. Adversity has taught the North to conquer one poor iota of her prejudices. It is this aspect of the camp at Beaufort which will give it an interest in the eyes of the onlooking world superior to that attaching to to Fortress Monroe, Hatteras Inlet, and Fort Pickens.</p>

<p>The second success of the fleet will be highly welcome to the Administration and the Commander-in-Chief, for two reasons- one political and one military. The Northern people had again grown impatient at the inaction or disasters of the two armies on the Lower and Upper Potomac. They demanded a victory, and demanded it in vain. General M'Clellan obstinately inculcated "patience," that virtue so difficult for an excited Democracy to observe. The universal feeling was," Something must be done; we want some equivalent for our money and other sacrifices." Popular enthusiasm threatened to flag, the subscriptions to the national loan fell off, and murmurs against the Administration began to make themselves heard. The achievements of the fleet will calm this dangerous mood of the public mind and give the Commander-in-Chief a few more weeks to mature his plans. In a military point of view, the 15,000 men at Beaufort will operate as an invaluable diversion of the enemy's forces. The invaders are within sixteen miles' distance of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, whose wooden bridges and trestle-work are easily destructible, and whose iron tires if once thrown into the river cannot now be replaced. The Confederates have to make head against a force of, say, 350,000 Federals pressing upon them on a line of 1500 miles, stretching from the Atlantic to the Missouri. Up to the present time they have done so with a fair amount of success. But can the Confederate Generals create new armies to watch every body of men whom the Federal fleet may throw upon their almost undefended coast? Or can they detach a sufficient number of men from the frontier without leaving the road to Richmond, Nashville, and Memphis open to their foes? It is evident that General Scott, for one, does not so believe, for his last words to time New Yorkers were, that by April or May next the "rebellion" would be surely crushed.</p>

<p>If the South still preserves the advantage of greater earnestness and singleness of purpose, the superior financial strength of the North begins to tell. The appeal of the planters to the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury and the reply thereto are signs that the South is "shortwinded" in this respect. Doubtless this difficulty would vanish if the South could make sale of her cotton, rice, and tobacco; but here the Federal fleet sails in and pitilessly relegates the South to her native resources. The Federal Government is well supported by the banks of the three chief cities of the North, and the people relieve the banks of the seven-and-three-tenths per cent Treasury notes nearly, but not quite, so fast as they are issued Northern patriotism, as expressed in <pb n="541">the readiness to take the Government loan, has by no means equalled the superabundant enthusiasm we are accustomed to witness in France on similar occasions, but seems to have exceeded the lagging offerings of the Italians for their late loan. American national sentiment, valued in dollars, stands midway between that of France and Italy. The immense quantities of grain and flour which the North has all this year been selling to British and French purchasers keep the exchange in favour of the Americans, and enable their banks, in spite of the stoppage of the usual export from the South, to retain the specie in their vaults. Thus confidence is maintained; the banks have not suspended specie payments and, notwithstanding Mr. Seward's uncalled-for and reckless circulars, Government and railroad stocks of loyal States are higher now than they have been since the Presidential election.</p>

<p>In the mean time, among the mountains of Western Virginia a revolutionary movement has been progressing which is independent, to some extent, of both North and South. The people of thirty-nine contiguous counties of the trans-Allegheny section of Virginia, occupying an area about twice the size of Wales, and numbering 282,000, of whom only 9000 are slaves, have declared their independence of the State of Virginia, and, organised themselves, with great unanimity, into a new state, called Kanawha, from the river of that name, which traverses it. Although the Kanawhans occupy a territory of giant value to the United States, and although the region has been liberated from Confederate armies by M'Clellan and Rosencranz, yet this demonstration meets with no favour from the Federal Government, which cannot now afford to countenance the right of revolution, even when it is made in behalf of the Union and the old flag. Separated as these people are from Eastern Virginia by physical barriers similar to those which divide Savoy from Italy, and united to the adjacent free-labour States by similar pursuits and moral and political sympathies, it is very improbable, come what may, that the old territorial arrangements will ever be restored. But the incident furnishes another proof that the air of America was charged with revolution, and that the time was ripe for a recombination of the heterogeneous elements of which the United States for the last forty years have been composed.</p>

<P>M<hi rend="smallcaps">UCH</hi> interest is felt in the recent determination of the Federal Government to fortify its coast, lake, and frontier line, as conveyed in Mr. Seward's instructions of the 14th of October. The American Government, however, have for some time past been repairing and enlarging the system of fortifications on the Canadian frontier. One of the strongest of the enlarged works is Fort Montgomery, at Rowse's Point, at the head of Lake Champlain. This fort has been nicknamed Fort Blunder, because erected upon British soil, afterwards given up, under treaty, to the United States. The fort has been considerably enlarged, and is now nearly completed. It will mount sixty-five guns in position, and twenty-five en barbette. It is protected on the land side by a moat and rampart of earth; and, on the whole, it is a very formidable work. Rowse's Point is about thirty-eight miles from Montreal, and upon the main line of railway communication between Boston, New York, and Canada. Lake Champlain, which lies between the States of New York and Vermont, extending for four miles into Lower Canada, is 105 miles in length, north to south, its breadth varying from ten miles to half a mile. It contains numerous islands, receives several rivers, and discharges its superfluous waters by the Richelieu river into the St. Lawrence. This lake was the centre of  many important military operations during the revolutionary war, and now forms an important medium of commerce.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> British public has been agitated by intense excitement during the past week by the apparent imminence of a rupture of friendly relations between this country and America. To the facts which have occasioned this state of things, and to the light in which they may be viewed by the law of nations, we shall presently advert. Before doing so, however, we gladly recognise the possibility, and express the hope, faint though it be, that the matter in dispute may be satisfactorily settled, even before the publication of our present Number. Our remarks are intended to bear upon the facts as they stood at the moment of our going to press; and should any authentic information from the other side of the Atlantic reach our shores before these pages are in the hands of our readers which will render the following comments unnecessary, because untimely, none will rejoice more heartily than ourselves at being "a day after the fair."</p>

<p>The fact of the case lie in a very narrow compass; the statement of them, although hitherto <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> only, rests upon the concurrent testimony of several witnesses, and may faitly be assumed as trustworthy. They are so well known that it will not be necessary for us to give more than the barest outline of them. Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Commissioners of the Confederate States of America to France and England, together with their Secretaries, having succeeded in evading the blockade, and in reaching the neutral port of Havannah, engaged berths on board the mail-steamer La Plata from St. Thomas. Being on neutral ships, they made no secret of their intentions, nor of the official capacity in which they were acting. While these gentlemen were waiting at Havannah for the sailing of the Trent, the San Jacinto, an armed sloop in the service of the Federal Government at Washington, called at the port, having just left her station on the coast of Africa. Captain Wilks, the commander of the San Jacinto, under general instructions, it is presumed, from his own Government, for the time was too short to admit of special insructions, determined upon intercepting the Commissioners on their way to St. Thomas, and for this purpose started from Havannah to the Bahama Channel, a narrow roadstead through which the Trent would have to pass. As soon as the British mail-steamer hove in sight the San Jacinto made all ready to stop, search, and, if resisted, to sink her. The first step taken by the Captain of the American cruiser was to fire a shot across the bows of the Trent, and to show her colours; but, as the British steamer did not heed the summons, his next proceeding was to fire a shell, which exploded within a hundred yards of her. The Trent, being unarmed, immediately brought to, and Lieutenant Fairfax was sent on board to demand a list of the passengers. This having been refused, the Lieutenant said he had good reason to know that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, and their secretaries, were among the passengers, and he required that they should be given up to him. On the refusal of Captain Moir to comply with this requisition three boats' crews were dispatched from the Federal sloop, and boarded the trent, cutlass in hand. Further resistance on the part of Captain Moir was of course out of the question; and, under formal protest, the four gentlemen were seized and carried off as prisoners to the San Jacinto, and the Trent allowed to proceed on her voyage.</p>
 
<p>These facts have been laid before the law officers of the Crown, who have decided that the Captain of the San Jacinto has committed a breach of international law, and a dispatch from the British Government is already on its way to Lord Lyons, instructing him, it has been said, to demand the restoration of the captured gentlemen to the protection from which they have been illegally taken, and a disavowal and apology on the part of the Federal Government for the act of their own officer. If this demand be not complied with, it is rumoured that our Minister at Washington will forthwith return home;<pb n="568"> Mr. Adams, the American Minister at London, will be furnished with his passports; and diplomatic relations between the two countries will be broken off, in anticipation of war.</p>

<p>The ground upon which the law officers of the Crown rest their decision appears to be the only ground which could have been safely taken. The right of the San Jacinto to stop and search the Trent for contraband of war is not disputed. It is a right which Great Britain, as a foremost maritime power, has done her utmost to establish. The inclusion of persons as well as things within the category of contraband is also undoubted, although it remains a moot point (which, however, we shall not discuss) whether the diplomatic agents of one belligerent can be lawfully seized by another while proceeding in a neutral vessel between two neutral ports. It is a nice legal question, requiring for its decision the deliberate and solemn adjudication of a prize court. That which seems to be clear is that commanders of ships are not authorised by the law of nations, and cannot safely be permitted, to act on board neutral vessels on their own private views of law. The Captain of the San Jacinto, even on the hypothesis that Messrs. Slidell and Mason came within the description of contraband, was bound to carry the Trent into the nearest port, there to await the decision of a regularly constituted prize court. Had such decision been in his favour, we should have had no illegality of which to complain; had it been against him he would have been responsible for whatever damage he had inflicted upon the proprietors or the passengers of the Trent, in consequence of her interruption and detention. It may he quite true that by pursuing a legal course, instead of the high-handed one upon which he acted, he would have subjected the owners, crew, and passengers of the Trent to much more serious annoyance than they have now to complain of. But it is also true that by allowing the precedent we should open a wide door for every variety of insult to our mercantile marine from the ignorance, caprice, or passion of American commanding officers. Neutral vessels are not to be adjudged guilty of violating the laws of neutrality by every petty officer who has the authority and the power to arrest them. It might be very convenient, no doubt, in certain imaginable instances, for a police-constable to seize goods suspected to be stolen and simply to hand them over to the reputed owner. It would save an immensity of annoyance in some cases; but it is judged to be safer, on the whole, to refer the decision to a court of law, where evidence can be given on both sides and impartially sifted, and where verdict and sentence have a chance of being delivered with due and dispassionate deliberation. Now, international law is founded mainly upon the same principles of justice as those which are embodied in municipal law; and the very existence of prize courts rests upon the implication that between belligerents and neutrals all questions that arise shall be decided, not by an individual and private but by a public interpretation of the rights respectively of both parties.</p>

<p> But, believing, as we do, that a gross and, if sanctioned by submission, a dangerous infraction of international law and the rights of neutrals has been committed by the commander of the San Jacinto, we see many incidents connected with the case that should induce Great Britain to present her claim to reparation with as much calmness, considerateness, and forbearance as a due regard for the honour of her flag and the safety of her commercial marine will admit of, one or two of the most important of which we proceed, in the interest of peace, to submit to the judgment of our readers.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it deserves to be borne in mind that we are as yet without any trustworthy evidence that the act of Captain Wilks was done in obedience to instructions received from the Federal Government at Washington. The probabilities all lie the other way. The San Jacinto had but just left the coast of Africa, and had put into Havannah before it was possible for her to have had recent communications from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet. It was there and then only that he could have ascertained the intention of Messrs. Slidell and Mason to go out by the Trent, and no sufficient interval was left him to submit his project to the judgment of the Cabinet. Mr. Adams, the American Minister in London, volunteered, immediately on the arrival of the news by the La Plata, a statement of his conviction that the Federal Government knew nothing whatever of the transaction until after it was consummated. The rumours which have reached us from America since the arrival of the prisoners at Fort Monroe lend additional probability to this opinion. Captain Wilks was stated to have hinted in the course of a conversation with General Wool at the possible alternative of being cashiered for his act-a proof, if true, that he had acted without authority. Lord Lyons, our Minister at Washington, is reported to have expressed his opinion that Messrs. Sidell and Mason would be given up to England. The next arrival may bring us an assurance that the Federal Government have honourably declined to take advantage of the wrong committed by their own officer, and the amicable relations of the two Governments may be re-established upon a sounder basis than before.</p>

<p>In the next place, it behoves us to remember that the rights of belligerents, as against neutrals, a strained and unofficial interpretation of which has led to the present disagreeable dilemma, are mainly, if not solely, rights which England herself has persisted in establishing, not merely in the face of many protests, but even to the extremity of war. We are not, therefore, in a position to fire up in anger, or to proceed in haste or in harshness to the last fearful arbitrement in vindication of the wrong we believe ourselves to have received. And, in the last place, we may well make some allowance for the difficulties which surround the Lincoln Administration, and, if we cannot safely pass by such an offence as that perpetrated by Captain Wilks, we might, at any rate, act as courteously and considerately as possible in the prosecution of our demands. In this spirit and with these views we hope her Majesty's Government are dealing, and will deal, with the matter. Hitherto the great majority of the people of England have kept their natural excitement under creditable restraint, and we firmly believe will be prepared to make any sacrifice of feeling, not inconsistent with national honour, in order to avert a war with their American kin. We earnestly trust that their forbearance will meet with its due reward, and that by disavowing the act of Captain Wilks, and surrendering the Southern Commissioners to the hands from which they were summarily and rudely taken, the Federal Government will save themselves, the world, and us from hostilities which, while they would disgrace humanity, would bring nothing but evil to either party.</p>

<p rend="center">OPINIONS OF THE FRENCH PRESS ON THE SEIZURE OF<lb/> 
MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>

<p>The whole of the Paris press, and more especia1ly the semi-official journals, warmly espouse the side of England in her quarrel with the American Federal Government.</p>

<p>An article in the<hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>, written in a semi-official style, after pointing out how deeply France is interested in the American question, proposes that, in case of a rapture between England and America, France should coincide with England in any recognition of the Southern Confederacy, and, in order to render any resistance on the part of the Northern States out of the question, unite her naval forces with those of England. "At this moment (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> the fate of two peoples and perhaps the repose of the world, is in the hands of the Cabinet of Washington. Its resolutions may lead to events of incalculable importance; but in any case we cannot but admit that England is right to act as she is doing. We will go further-she is merely accomplishing a rigorous duty, commanded by the circumstances, and all Europe will approve her conduct." In another article headed "How is France to act?" the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> expresses more decided views:- "In our opinion (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>) it is difficult for her to remain indifferent in presence of a violation of international law which concerns all maritime nations. We believe that very likely the Northern States will refuse to accede to the demands made by England; in that case we may presume that war will be immediately declared, and the first act of hostility will be the recognition of the Southern States .... We are convinced that the war between the two countries will be an interminable one, but, on the other hand, we cannot remain idle spectators of a struggle between North America and England. It is quite clear that it is not our duty to avenge the wrongs of England, but the recognition of the South by that Power, which would imply a final separation from the United States, could not be regarded as an isolated act, and would impose upon France the necessity of assuming a decisive attitude in this question. The result would be that two great maritime Powers of Europe might be drawn into a common action with the same identical political object; and, that being the case, as we have observed before, President Lincoln, by provoking an act of brutality, may perhaps have acted with foresight by preparing a separation which he can neither propose nor accept." In another article the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> seems to foreshadow a disposition on the part of the French Government to recognise the Southern Confederacy if England should set the example of recognition.</p>

<p>With regard to the affair of the Trent the <hi rend="italic">Pays</hi> says:- " The irritation excited in England, and the opinion of the law officers of the Crown, will perhaps make the Washington Cabinet reflect seriously, and induce it to offer the fullest reparation to the British Government. If Mr. Lincoln refuses reparation for the insult to the Trent, the entire responsibility of the consequences will rest with him."</p>

<p>The<hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> says:-"In fact, it is impossible that the Americans should not understand how irregular is the arrest of MM. Slidell and Mason on board the Trent; how contrary it is to the law of nations; and how prejudicial the consequences of this act would be to themselves. It would be the consecration of the 'right of search,' against which they have always protested, and which was one of the chief causes of the war they themselves waged with England in 1812-a right of search exercised no only on commercial vessels but on ships of war, for the mail-steamers are Royal vessels, having on board a Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, and their officers wear the uniform of the British Navy. By declaring contraband of war simple passengers with or without a diplomatic mission the Americans strike a mortal blow against the privileges of neutral States, which it is to their interest more than to any one else to see respected."</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">D&eacute:bats</hi> thinks that the neglect of Captain Wilks to seize the despatches on board the Trent was a fatal oversight.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> thinks that the Emperor Napoleon has tendered, or will tender, his good offices or mediation for the settlement of the dispute.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL SCOTT ON THE AFFAIR OF THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The United States' Consul has communicated to the French papers a letter of General Scott (who is now in Paris), in which he declares there is no truth in the report that the Cabinet of Washington had ordered the seizure of the Southern Commissioners, even if under the protection of a neutral flag. He is quite ignorant of the decision of his Government, but he says it is necessary to preserve good relations between America and England. "I hope," continues General Scott, "that Earl Russell and Mr. Seward will agree on a solution of the question whether the persons who were arrested on board the Trent were contraband of war or not. If they were agents of the rebels it will be difficult to convince even impartial minds that they were less contraband of war than rebel soldiers or cannons." In conclusion, General Scott expresses a conviction that a war between America and England, cannot take place without more serious provocations than those at present given.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The Toronto <hi rend="italic">Lender</hi>, the most influential organ of the Canadian Ministry, characterises the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell as "the most offensive outrage which Brother Jonathan has ever dared to perpetrate on the British flag. It strikes at the root of British authority, and affirms a right on the part of the Northern States to which the meanest nation in Christendom could not honourably submit. We assume that Lord Lyons will at once demand from the Washington Government a disavowal of the act of their Commodore and the release of Messr. Mason and Slidell. Not to assume this, would be to suppose that Britain is indifferent to the rights and honour of her flag."</p>

<p>The American vessel the Lady Franklin entered Plymouth Sound on Tuesday, and at midnight a fire broke out in her forehold which ended in her total destruction. It is supposed that the fire was wilful, some of the crew being Southerners, and it appears several of them have absconded. Lady Franklin was in ballast.</p>

<p>Some months ago the Perthshire, a large colonial vessel of 840 tons, the property of Mr. William Gray, if Hartlepool, was boarded without legal warrant by the United States' steamer Massachusetts, off the American coast, on the alleged ground that the Perthshire had violated the blockade of the Southern ports. The case was represented by the British Minister to the Government at Washington, and Earl Russell has informed the owner that the President will recommend Congress to vote $pound:200 as compensation.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> U<hi rend="smallcaps">NITED</hi> S<hi rend="smallcaps">TATES'</hi> N<hi rend=smallcaps">AVY</hi>-The statistics of the United States' Navy show ten slops of the line, the youngest of which was built in 1840. Four were still on the stocks, four were at Norfolk when that port was abandoned. There are ten sailing-frigates of 50 guns: two were built in 1797; not one is of 1500 British tons burden; the youngest were built in 1855. There are twenty sloops of from 24 to 16 guns: the youngest was built in 1854. They are too small for their armament. The steam navy is the kernel of the naval force of the Federal Government. It consists of five screw-frigates built, and one building. These are of the Niagra and Minnesota School. There are six first-class steam-sloops. Of these the crack ship is the Brooklyn, 25 guns, and to this class belongs the San Jacinto, 13 guns. There are three paddle-steamers- the Powhattan represents the class; and eight-second class screw steam-sloops and one paddle-wheel- all except the last, built since 1855; they carry from 6 to 3 guns. The third-class screw-sloops, four in number, carry more guns-one 8, the other 5. There are four paddle-steamers, two of 3 guns and two of 1. Three steam-tenders make up the Navy, consisting,<hi rend="italic">on paper</hi>, of a total of 10 line-of-battle ships, 10 frigates, 20 sloops, 3 brigs, and 3 troop-ships- all these aree sailers; of 6 screw-frigates, of 18 screw and 8 paddle-wheel sloops, and of 3 steam-tenders. The Federal Government has increased the list by 100-merchant ships fitted out to maintain the blockade.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the Cunard steamer Persia we have received New York journals of the 20th ult.</p>

<p>The principal subject of interest is the reception of the news of the capture of Messrs. Mason and Slidell on board the British steamer Trent. The American account of the affair agrees with that of Captain Moir, except in that it is represented that all the documents of Messrs. Mason and Shidell were seized. It is also admitted that Captain Wilks, of the San Jacinto, acted without orders from Washington, that ship having only just returned to the West Indies from Africa. The news of the capture was received with great joy by the people of the large cities, although the means by which it was made caused a fall of stocks on Wall-street. The captives were transferred from New York to Fort Warren, near Boston. Commodore Wilks is the same officer who commanded the United States' exploring expedition in 1838-42, the account of which was given to the world in five large volumes.</p>

<p rend="center">WHAT THE NORTHERN JOURNALS SAY CONCERNING THE SEIZURE OF<lb/>
 MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>
<p>The journals are full of quotations from Vattel, Wheaton, Phillimore, and Kent, and if decisions of Lord Stowell, to prove that the dipatches, and the Commissioners who carried them, were "contraband of war," subjecting the vessel to the penalty of capture and condemnation in a Prize Court. The practice of taking British seamen out of American merchant ships at the commencement of this century is cited as estopping Great Britain from any right to object. The cutting out of the Caroline from New York waters, by Sir Allan McNab in 1837, is brought forward, the circumstances that preceded and justified that act being omitted by the journal that cites it. Mr. George Sumner, of Boston, mentions the capture of Mr. Laurens, the American Ambassador, in 1780, as having been made from a Dutch vessel, which, however, is erroneous, the vessel being an American one. The journals do not seem generally to anticipate that the irregularity of allowing the Trent to proceed on her way would give cause of offence to the British Government and nation. They regard it as an act of kindness on the part of Commodore Wilks. Of the New York journals, only the <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi> doubted whether the Commissioners were contraband, and called them "political prisoners under the protection of a neutral flag," whose seizure was unjustifiable, and ought to be repudiated by the United States' Government. The two organs of the French population in New York regarded the seizure as a breach of international law. The <hi rend="italic">Boston Advertiser</hi> preserves its usual moderation and judgment, and "inclines to the belief" that the despatches and Ambassadors were contraband of war. The rest of the journals of the three principal cities, which are written in the English language, treat the matter as one too plain for doubt. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is as brutal in its utterances as usual; the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Commerce</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> simply reflect the feeling of the people, and affect to believe that England, far from remonstrating, will "applaud the gallant act of Lieutenant Wilks, so full of spirit and good sense, and such an exact imitation of the policy she has always stoutly defended and invariably pursued."</p>

<p rend="center">A VIOLATION OF NEW GRANADIAN NATIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
<p>General Sumner, in command of a regiment of the regular army of the United States, seized three returning Californians on board the Panama steamer on a charge of "Southern proclivities." On their arrival at the Isthmus the Governor protested against the passage of these political prisoners across the soil of Now Granada. General Sumner, backed by the force of his regiment, refused to forego his design, and the Governor contented himself with a protest.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERANT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>
<p>The reports of Captain Dupont and Brigadier-General Sherman have appeared. The capture of the forts was made with the loss of fifteen killed and wounded on the Federal side. The loss of the means of debarkation forced the Commanders to abandon their projected attack by land. The negroes had sacked Beaufort and were very favourably disposed towards "the Yankees." Many of the negroes who would not flee with their masters to the woods were shot by their owners, and this cruel proceeding had greatly exasperated the survivors.
<p>Another naval expedition, under General Butler, was in an active state of preparation at Boston.</p>
<p>General Dix has landed 4000 troops on the eastern shore of Virginia, and has issued a proclamation guaranteeing constitutional rights to loyal inhabitants. It is reported that the Federals were well received by the people of Accomac and Northampton counties.</p>
<p>The Federals have now 480,000 men in arms, lacking only 20,000 of the numter authorised by Congress.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARMING OF THE SLAVES.</p>
<p>Colonel Cochrane, a lifelong pro-slavery Democrat, in an address to his regiment, proclaimed "the military necessity of the emancipation of the slaves." The Secretary of War (Mr. Cameron), who was present, followed with a short but significant speech to this effect:-
<p>Soldiers!- It is too late for me to make you it speech to-night, but I will say that I heartily approve every sentiment uttered by your noble commander. The doctrines which he has laid down I approve as if they were my own words. They are my sentiments-sentiments which will not only lead you to victory, but which will in the end reconstruct this our glorious Federal Constitution. It is idle to talk about treating with these rebels upon their own terms. We must meet them as our enemies, treat them as enemies, and punish them as enemies, until they shall learn to behave themselves. Every means which God has placed in our hands it is our duty to use for the purpose of protecting ourselves. I am glad of the opportunity to say here, what I have already said elsewhere, in these few words, that I approve the doctrines this evening enunciated by Colonel Cochrane.</p>
<p>General Burnside, of Rhode Island, and Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, the colleague of Charles Sumner, have made declarations of similar import. The latter said:-</p>
<p>It was poor policy to manage the war otherwise. It was useless to send our men from their firesides, their workshops, and their farms to die upon the Southern soil if the cause of the war were not removed, and the power that brought on the conflict, without a cause, and aimed at the destruction of the Republic, remained untouched in the chief source of its strength.</p>
<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>Five bridges on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad have been burned by the Unionists of East Tennessee. This line is the most important line of communication between Virginia and the SouthWestern States.</p>
<p>Colonel Corcoran, of the 69th (Irish) Regiment, has bean thrown into gaol as a hostage for the privateersmen condemned in New York, and twelve other officers are designated as hostages for the safety of the rest of the privateer's crew.</p>
<p>The Georgia planters have held a convention in which it was resolved that if the present cotton crop remain unsold they will not plant any cotton next year.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>The New York banks have asked for and obtained a postponement of the time when they will be called upon to take the third 50,000,000 dollars of the national loan until the 1st of January next.</p>
<p>Another condemnation of a culprit for engaging in the slave trade has taken place. The trial was held in New Bedford.</p>
<p>Edwin James has been engaged by the <hi rend="italic">New York Leader</hi>, a weekly newspaper of no high standing, to write autobiographical experiences. The editor offers him 2000 dollars for a series of articles of this kind.</p>

<p>A numerously-attended meeting of American residents in Paris assembled a few days ago at, the Hotel Westminster, to present their respects to General Scott, on the occasion of his arrival in that city. His Excellency Mr. Dayton, the United States Minister, in addressing the General on behalf of his countrymen in Paris, assured him of their respect for himself personally, and their high appreciation of the value of his long services to his country, referring particularly to the activity and energy displayed in his recent loyal defence of the capital when threatened by the Confederates of the South,, and declaring that his countrymen would ever cherish in their hearts a grateful recollection of his name. He expressed their regret at the feeble state of his health, and their wishes for his speedy restoration; and trusted that, on his return home, he would find his country once more happy and united,and  more prosperous than ever. General Scott, who seemed much affected at the compliment paid him, replied in suitable terms.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Federal Camp on the Potomac continues to forward to us Illustrations of noteworthy incidents in connection with the civii war raging in that part of the States. Four of these, respecting which he writes as follows, are given on the accompanying pages:-Fifty miles below Washington the Confederates have constructed some formidable batteries on the Virginia shore of the Potomac, opposite to a place known as Budd's Ferry. Among the series of sketches forwarded you will find one showing Budd's house, and a small earthwork mounting two 10-pound Parrott guns, which teh Federalists have there in position. Preparations are being made at the same point for attack on the COnfederate batteries over the river, three exceedingly heavy ones having been unmasked.

ran the blockade by hugging the Maryland shore closely, where the water shoals considerably. Heavy vessels dare not risk it, as the deep channel lies right under the batteries, and the consequence is the blockade of the Potomac may be looked upon as effective. We on our side watched the little ships anxiously as they came within range of the enemy's guns, which they no sooner did than a terrible fire of shot and shell opened upon them, not one, however being struck seriously, and all enabled to keep their course down river. We, the spectators ran probably more risk than the vese1s, for many of the shells came over to our neighbourhood, bursting in close proximity to where we stood. Our turn then came, and we gave them a few rounds from the tiny Parrotts, pitching the 10-pound shells right into their works, and peppering a steamer, one of the Confederate navy, until they were glad to haul her into Quantico Creek. The river at this point is a mile and three quarters in breadth. My "Reconnaissance with General Sickles in the Bed of the Potomac" was a most remarkable ride, for nearly the whole time we had to wade to our horses' girths in the river itself, sometimes even swimming, the banks being impracticable in places.

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> one topic of the day is the great question whether American democracy will permit American statesmanship to do right. No other subject has any claim to Present discussion; for it is impossible to talk of social reforms, or other of the ordinary themes of the journalist, when England, making a stand for her honour, but in nowise irritated or unreasonable, awaits the tidings whether the New Year is to be inaugurated by the signal for war. At another time it might be interesting to hear that the Mexicans have resolved not to risk a struggle with the great Powers that have united to put down piracy and ruffianism in Mexico, and to assert the rights of civilisation. We might be glad to know that there was a probability of these objects being effected without bloodshed, and we might urge upon the Governments to be in no hurry to believe in the value of promises extorted by fear, and which must be rendered valuable by material guarantees, and by the condign punishment of those who have been indulging for years in tyranny and robbery. But an expedition which excited some interest a month ago may now sail almost unmarked, except that England casts a not unsatisfied glance at her own share in the ships, and is glad that they are sailing westward. The Indian news is far from uninteresting, but, except that we shall be glad to hear that the Indian cotton crop is likely to be quadrupled, we have not much attention for the Oriental Empire. On Christmas Day many of the gathered households of the country may be graver than is their wont at that season.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Number last week contained an account of the forcible seizure of Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Confederate Commissioners to France and England, on board the Trent, by bodies of armed men from the United States' war-ship San Jacinto; and we now give, on the preceding page, an Engraving representing this violation of international law-which will be attended, it is to be feared, with the very gravest consequences. The purser of the mail-steamer Trent supplies the following narrative of the circumstances attending the boarding of that vessel by the Lieutenant and men of the American sloop-of-war San Jacinto and the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners:-
<p>I hasten to forward some particulars of the grievous outrage committed today (Nov. 8)against the English flag by the United States' steam-sloop San Jacinto, Captain Wilks. You have probably heard how, some three weeks ago, the little steamer Theodora, having on board the commissioners sent by the Confederate States of America to London and Paris, ran the blockade at Charlston, arriving safely in Havannah. Once arrived there,they, of course, imagined that on neutral territory they were perfectly free and safe from all molestation, and therefore made no attempt to conceal their names, position, and intendedmovements. Mr. Slidell, the commissioner for Paris, was accompanied by his wife, son, and three daughters, and also by his secretary, Mr. G. Eustis, with his wife, Mr. Mason, the Commissioner for England, being accompanied by his secretary, Mr. M'Farland. It was well known in Havannah that berths were booked for the whole party to proceed by this steamer to St. Thomas, there to join the homeward West India mail steam-ship for Southamton. They accordingly embarked yesterday morning, trusting, to receive the same protection under the English flag which they had already received from that of Spain.</p>
<p>We left Havannah yesterday morning at eight. This morning, about half-past eleven, we observed a large steam-ship ahead, and on a nearer approach found she was hove to, evidently awaiting us. We were then in the narrowest part of the Bahama Channel, abreast of Paredon Grande Lighthouse. As soon as we were well within range we had the first intimation of her nationality and intentions by a round-shot being fired across our bows, and at the same moment by her showing American colours. We were now sufficiently near to observe that all her ports were open, guns run out, and crew at their stations. On a still nearer approach she fired a shell from a swivel-gun of large calibre on her forecastle, which passed within a few yards of the ship, bursting about a hundred yards to leeward. We were not within hail, when Captain Moir, commanding this ship, asked the American what he meant by stopping his ship, and why he did so by firing shotted guns, contrary to usual custom. The reply was that he wished to send a boat on board of us. This was immediately followed by a boat pushing off from the side of the San Jacinto, containing between twenty and thirty men, heavily armed, under the command of the First Lieutenant, who came up on the quarter-deck, and, after asking for Captain Moir, demanded a list of passengers. As his "right of search" was denied, the information required was, of course, peremptorily denied. He then stated that he had information that Messrs.
Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland were on board, and demanded that they should be given up. This also being indignantly refused, Mr. Slidell himself came forward and said that the four gentlemen named were then before him, but he appealed to the British flag, under which they were sailing, for protection. The Lieutenant said that his orders were to take them on board the San Jacinto by force if they would not surrender. He then walked to the side of the ship waved his hand: immediately three more heavily-armed boats pushed off and surrounded the ship, and the party of marines who come in first boat came up and took possession of the quarter-deck; these, however, he ordered down on the main-deck, to take charge of the gangway ports. Captain Williams, R.N., the naval agent in charge of the mails, who was of course present during this interview, then, in the name of her Majesty, he being the only person on board directly representing her, made a vehement protestation against this piratical act.</p>
<p>During the whole of this time the San Jacinto was about 200 yards distant from us on the port beam, her broadside guns, which were all manned, directly bearing upon us. Any open resistence to such a force was of course hopeless, although, from the loud and repeated plaudits which followed Captain William's protestations, and which were joined in by every one, without exception, of the passengers congregated on the quarter-deck, men of all nations, and from the manifested desire of some to resist to the last, I have no doubt but that every person would have joined heart and soul in the struggle had our Commander but given the order. Such an order he could not, under such adverse circumstances, conscientiously give, and it was therefore considered sufficient that a party of marines, with bayonets fixed, should forcibly lay hands on the gentlemen named. This was done, and the gentlemen retired to their cabins to arrange some few changes of clothing. A most heartrending scene now took place between Mr. Slidell, his eldest daughter-a noble girl devoted to her father-and the Lieutenant. It would require a far more able pen than mine to describe how, with flashing eyes and quivering lips, she threw her herself in the doorway of the cabin where her father was, resolved to defend him with her life, till, on the order being given to the marines to advance, which they did, with bayonets pointed at this poor defenceless girl, her father ended the painful scene by escaping from the cabin by a window, when he was immediately seized by the marines and hurried into the boat, calling out to Captian Moir as he he left that he held him and his Government responsible for this outrage.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> attitude and bearing of the people of England under the circumstances which have arisen in connection with the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners on board the Trent have been in all respects worthy of the occasion. This is not the verdict of mere self-complacency, but ample testimony has been borne by the press of France to the mingled dignity, moderation, and firmness of purpose which have been displayed by the whole country, and without exception of class. The bitterest satirists on England and the English have failed to find anything in our conduct on which to base even a sneer; while for an accusation no shadow of a foundation has been discovered. If it were necessary we might quote some of the language of writers in Continental journals in which our national spirit, our unanimity of feeling, and our consciousness of being in the right are held up to admiration in no measured terms; but we only refer to these eulogies for the purpose of illustration, and with no desire to make more of a highly creditable state of things than it deserves. It would certainly have been a melancholy thing if a country like this should on the occurrence of an act of aggression have set about to scold and vapour with all the sound and fury of those, whether persons or nations, who are assured neither of their position nor the rights of the matter in dispute; and therefore, while admitting simply and unostentatiously the justice of any commendation which we have received for our conduct in this juncture of our national affairs, we can afford to be almost surprised that any one should have conceived it could have been other than it has been. It is to be observed that, as the time since the intelligence of the Jacinto affair was 
<p>

		</figure></p>

received has run on, the public mind has taken a calmer view of the situation; but, nevertheless, there has not appeared any abatement of the resolute determination to hold to the honour of England at all hazards which was the first sensation that pervaded the land. If there be any change in the view of this question-and we think there is-it is a growing incredulity with regard to the necessity for a resort to the bloody arbitrement of the sword. Reflection, consideration, examination of the subject in all its bearings, seem to lead to something like a conviction that, if a similar process be applied to the question on the other side of the water, it must result in a peaceable issue. The most recent accounts show that some change has come over the spirit in which most of the Federal so-called organs of public opinions deal with this subject. The tone adopted by these journals is much more serious and practical than that which characterised the delivery of opinions on the first blush of the matter; and something has been done to familiarise the popular mind in America with the surrender of the Confederate Commissioners as a contingency by no means remote. Some of them go so far as to say that the recent event cannot-we suppose because it ought not- be a cause of war; and others have allowed that, if the act of the officers of the Federal navy is not justifiable by the law of nations, it cannot inflict any wound on the national honour to make a suitable apology. The signs of the existence of such a feeling, however feeble they may be, are not without significance, and from them may be  drawn auguries of things to come which, we believe, the most sensitive Englishmen would be willing enough to witness. It must be remembered that these indications of a tendency to
<p>

		</figure></p><pb n="592">
concession in America have taken place before there has been any knowledge of the manner in which the affair of the Trent has been received in England. Surely the august spectacle of a nation unanimous for the vindication of its honour, and consentaneous in its conviction that that honour has been wounded, cannot be without its effect even on a nation so impulsive as the Americans. It is with a full consciousness of all the disadvantages, present and prospective, to both countries which must follow a war such as that which we are obliged to contemplate, but ready at all points for even such a contingency, that England awaits the result of the intercommunication between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In the mean time, in a spirit of perfect candour, and divesting ourselves of any mere partisanship, it may be worth while to consider some of the disadvantages which this untoward act- for untoward it is from any point of view-is calculated to bring upon the cause for which the Northern States are contending. It is useless to blink the fact that the civil war has assumed a magnitude which probably we in Europe did not contemplate, and which has called forth at the very earliest period all the resources of the North. The visions of a rapid subjugation of the South in one triumphant campaign have faded before the stern reality of the situation; and, while it is broadly stated on all hands on this side of the water that a restoration of the old Union is assuming the aspect of an impossibility, it has been whispered that such an opinion has secretly taken root in the minds of the Cabinet at Washington, and that a contest with England is adopted as a policy out of which may spring a pretext for the ultimate acknowledgment of the independence of the South. If this is really the case, why, all ground for argument is cutaway, and it must be readily admitted that no course more calculated to attain that end could have been selected than that of bringing on a quarrel with this country.</p>
<p>But disregarding the insinuation that a policy so tortuous underlies the conduct of the advisers of Mr. Lincoln, and assuming that the object of the Federal Government is the rehabilitation of the Union, it is impossible not to see the instantaneous damage that would be done to that object if war with England comes to pass. Already we see in the message of Mr. Jefferson Davis indications of the effect which such a dispute would have on the fortunes of the party of which he is the head. His bold assertion of a violation of international law in the case of the Trent is pregnant with suggestion, and its interpretation is that he sees in that act a near prospect of the recognition of the Southern States as an independent Republic by one of the first Powers of Europe. Of the moral force of such a declaration on the cause of which he is the apostle there can be little doubt; but if the matter should come to positive hostilities a glance will suffice to show, in the first place, the whole Southern seaboard practically set free from blockade, the cotton trade in full operation, under the practical convoy of the fleets of England, with a corresponding financial effect on the resources of that part of the American continent; while, on the other hand, the ports of the North will be fast closed, and an equivalent check placed on the commerce and sources of strength and action of the Federal power. This is no idle boast or senseless assertion, for we have the ships, the guns, and, above all, at this juncture of our naval history, we are strong just where we have hitherto been weak; we have the men, the sailors, without whom all the, vessels of war in the world would be inert masses. Already there comes from the great emporiums of trade and commerce, from New York notably, the rumour of mercantile stagnation, and, worse still, the cry of popular distress. Civil war alone has sown the seeds of paralysis in that national prosperity of which Americans were so justly proud, and in the most fortunate future looms a large national debt and years of financial struggle. What may not be predicated as the result of a war with a powerful kingdom like England, added to the internecine strife which is now going on in the States? In the interests of humanity and of civilisation and progress one shrinks from the contemplation of the rebound of a quarter of a century of a nation which, always a world's wonder, possessed within it so many of the elements of advancement to greatness.</p>
<p>Nor, in considering the consequences of an unfriendly termination of the differences between England and the Federal States, can the probable conduct of other nations in Europe be placed out of sight. In the very first rank, of course, must be placed France; and, if the opinions of the Imperial Government be at all truly indicated, there is little doubt of the line which will be taken by that country. If the arguments of the French journals-even those which, as the phrase goes, are "inspired" from the highest quarters-mean anything, they mean that this question is not to be looked at from a merely English point of view at all. It is stated that it is only an accident that the Confederate Commissioners were seized under the British flag; for, supposing they had found it convenient to take passage in a French vessel, the officers of the San Jacinto would have felt themselves equally bound to have captured them under the tricolor. In fact, it is urged that the question is a purely international one, and one on which it is impossible but that the opinion of all the nations of Europe must be consentaneous. The <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> and its immediate vindication rest on England, but the moral force of international opinion will also be brought to bear on the quarrel, and that in direct opposition to the American side of the question. These considerations take the matter wholly out of the comparatively narrow bounds of a captious dispute between England and the Federal States. The question becomes cosmopolitan, and its bearings and its consequences assume adequate proportions.</p>
<p>If something of all this, which we have, owing to an earnest desire to enter on the discussion with the utmost moderation, perhaps too faintly indicated, could present itself to the American as it most surely does to the English mind, we might yet see a satifactory, because a peaceful, solution of this vexed question. England, resolute and prepared for any eventualility, but more in sorrow than in anger, demands reparation for an international as well as a national wrong. If she had any choice she would have preferred that any other State of Europe should have undertaken the vindication of a principle which she holds only in common with other nations. There are special reasons too obvious and too often dwelt upon which make a quarrel of this kind in the abstract distasteful to her. She does not forget "that blood is thicker than water," but she also remembers that the time has been when in a contest for high principles and rights she could bear to see conflict even between brother and brother on her own soil, and, grievous as was the sacrifice, it was a lustration from which she did not shrink. She wishes to shed no kinsman's blood now: let us hope that that feeling will prove to be reciprocal.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS, OF THE SAN JACINTO.</p>

<p>C<hi rend="smallcaps">APTAIN</hi> C<hi rend="smallcaps">HARLES</hi> W<hi rend="smallcaps">ILKS</hi>, the hero of the hour in the United States, was born in the State of New York in 1805, and entered the United States' Navy in 1818. In 1838 he was commissioned by the Federal Government, with the grade of Captain, to take command of a naval expedition to explore the countries bordering on the Pacific and Southern Oceans. Starting from New York, he doubled Cape horn, visited the Sandwich, Feejee, and other Polynesian groups, and the coast of Oregon; crossed over to Australia and Tasmania, decending as low as the 61st degree of south latitude. He visited Singapore and Borneo, and returned to New York in 1842, by way of time Cape of Good Hope. Several courts-martial were held upon him, from which, however, he issued without loss of rank. The results of his expedition were recounted in a voluminous illustrated work entitled "A Narrative of the United States' Exploring Expedition." In 1848 the Geographical Society of London presented him with a gold medal as a token of their appreciation of his services to science. He has since published a work entitled "Western America," which contains statistical and geographical facts and maps relating to the States of the Pacific Coast. He was returning from the coast of Africa, in command of the San Jacinto, when, hearing at Havannah that the Confederate Coinmissioners intended to take passage in the steamer Trent, he determined to seize them and any despatches they might have with them. In acting as he did he states that he was guided only by his own notions of his duty to his country, and that he had no instructions from his superiors at Washington.</p>
 
<p rend="center">THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CONFEDERATE<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps"> STATES.</hi></p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> our Issue of this week we give Portraits of Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell, the Commissioners of the Southern Stats of America, who were arrested by the officers of the San Jacinto on board the British mail-steamer Trent.</p>

<p rend="smallcaps">MR. MASON.</p>
<p>This gentleman, the Commissioner to England, is a native of the State of Virginia, and is of direct English descent, this fact of lineage having been always held traditionally in his family. He is the grandson of George Mason, one of the most celebrated of the worthies of Virginia, who was the framer and chief supporter of the first Constitution or that State. The subject of our present memoir was born in the latter part of the last century, and made his first appearance in public life in 1823, as a member of a Convention of the Southern States which was assembled for the purpose of carrying our a favourite plan of Washington for opening up the resources of Virginia by means of a canal between the Ohio and the Chesapeake Rivers. In 1827 he was a member of a Convention under whose auspices the old Constitution of the State of Virginia was altered. In 1846 he was elected to the Senate of the United States, and was afterwards rechosen at every election almost without opposition. Immediately on his becoming a Senator he was appointed a member of that important section of the Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee, which position he held without interruption until his retirement from that body, and he was for more than ten years the chairmmman of that Committee. In 1850 he took part in the discussion which ended in California being declared a Free State, and was one of the seven or eight members who, in conjunction with Mr. Jefferson Davis, was in favour of terminating the Convention of the Southern States with the Federal system by their withdrawal from the Union. In politics Mr. Mason has always been a consistent Democrat. He married the daughter of Mr. Benjamin Chew, a member of a family of some consideration in the State of Pennsylvania. Although not endowed with any remarkable energy or brilliancy, Mr. Mason has always shown capacity for affairs; while on his personal character as a gentleman of high honour and elevated sentiments no slur has ever been attempted to be cast.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SLIDELL.</p>
<p>Mr. Slidell, the Commissioner to France, was born in the city of New York, and the date of his birth also belongs to the last century. At a comparatively late period of life he commenced the study of the law, and, having formally embraced the legal profession, he removed to New Orleans, where he practised with great success and accumulated a large fortune by the exercise of  his ability and industry, which, combined with great energy of character, have always caused him to hold a prominent position in public life. He married the accomplished daughter of a gentleman of Louisiana, the lady who accompanied him in his voyage towards Europe was present at his capture on board the Trent, and is now residing in this country. Under the presidency of General Jackson he was appointed District Attorney for the State of Louisiana. He was subsequently elected to Congress for two terms, and served the first, but before the second had expired he was selected as the head of the mission to Mexico, and continued Minister for the United States in that country until war was declared. In 1853 he was elected a member of the Senate of the United States, and occupied that position until the secession of the Southern States. It should be mentioned that when Mr. Buchanan became President he was desirous of obtaining the services of Mr. Slidell in his Cabinet, and placed any office which might suit his views at his disposal, but that offer was not accepted. Afterwards the acceptance of more than one foreign mission was pressed on Mr. Slidell, and especially the post of United States' Minister to France, but these distinctions he also declined.</p>

<p>Several new banks of coral have been discovered off the coast of Oran (Algeria) promising a rich harvest for the coral fishers.</p>
<p>At the auction-rooms in the Rue Drouot, Paris, a few days back, three very small vases for flowers, in old sevres porcelain, and decorated in the style of the eighteenth century, were sold for 15,950f.</p>

<p>The gold medals of the Royal Academy for the year were on Tuesday awarded as follows:-To Andrew Brown Donaldson, for the best historical painting; to George Slater, for the best historical group in sculpture; and to Thomas Henry Watson, for the best architectural design.</p>

<p>Tuesday's <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> contains a number of regulations, agreed to by the International Commission, for the regulation of the navigation of the Lower Danube. The provisions are very minute, and show the care that the commissioners have bestowed on the subject.</p>

<p>The Europa, which took out the instructions to Lord Lyons on the subject of the Trent steamer, left Queenstown on the 1st inst. for Halifax; and the Federal Government most probably knew the nature of those instructions on Wednesday or Thursday. The following are the steamers which will bring important news from America subsequently to the receipt of the instructions in Washington, via -The Canada will leave Boston on the 11th, call off Cape Race for news on the 13th, and reach Queenstown on the 22nd. The North American will leave Portland on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 15th, and reach Londonderry on the 23rd. The City of Baltimore will leave New York on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach Queenstown on the 24th. The Bavaria will leave New York on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach Cowes on the 26th. The Africa will leave New York on the 18th, call off Cape Race on the 20th, and reach Queenstown on the 30th.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the screw-steamer Etna we have received New York journals of the 30th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OUTRAGE ON THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The journals of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, as a general rule, speak much more hesitatingly of the legality of Captain Wilks's act than they did a week previously. They condescend to contemplate the possibility of reclamations on the part of Great Britain, and of yielding thereto. The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says:-" If the British Government can be induced for the sake of reclaiming them" (Messrs. Mason and Slidell) "to take the highest American ground in favour of neutral maritime rights, we shall have sold them for a great deal more than they are worth." The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> acknowledges that the Northerners have hitherto been unjust to the British Government in complaining that it recognised the South as a belligerent Power. The President must soon take the same position.</p>

<p>It has transpired that no dispatches have been found in the trunks of the Ambassadors. The <hi rend="italics">New York Times</hi> remarks upon this unwelcome discovery :- "In that case the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of much of the reasoning employed in justification of the act of Captain Wilks may become nugatory."</p>

<p>The lawyers have begun to suspect that the Laurens and other cases have been misrepresented by Messrs. George Sumner and Everett, while the moneyed men still refuse to accept the assurances of the journals that it was "all right." It was feared, however, that the news of the turning of the Harvey Birch by the Nashville would again inflame the minds of the people against England.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS' RECEPTION IN BOSTON.</p>

<p>The Bostonians, usually so much more friendly than the New Yorkers, have on this occasion not acted in a manner worthy of their well-earned reputation. A public banquet at the Revere House was got up for the hero of the hour, and nothing could exceed the bad taste of the Massachusetts speakers (among whom were Judges Bigelow and Russell, Governor Andrew, and Mayor Rice), whether their insolent bombast was levelled at their two unfortunate captives or at the Government and people of a friendly nation.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>The Federals had taken possession of the island of Tybee, at the mouth of the Savannah River. The people of that city were flying panicstruck into the interior. The Confederates had blocked up the inlet leading to Savannah.</p>

<p>The Federals at Hilton Island found the place vary unhealthy, and were suffering much from fever and ague and congestive fever. All the teamsters and camp-followers were leaving for the North. The Federals have also occupied a post on St. Helena Sound, fifteen miles north of Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 19th ult. Colonel Brown opened fire from Fort Pickens on Pensacola, Florida. On the 24th the fight was still going on, we know not certainly with what result. The Southerners admit that the Navyyard was destroyed, with all its stores; that Pensacola had been evacuated; and that General Bragg had called for reinforcements. On the other hand, they claim to have driven off five vessels of war, to have riddled the Niagara with balls, and thoroughly disabled the Colorado. This is the Southern account; it will probably be another week before the Northern report reaches us.</p>

<p>The armies of the Potomac and the Upper Potomac were engaged in hutting themselves. It is still, however, strenuously denied that they are going into winter quarters.</p>

<p>The largest body of men ever reviewed on the American continent was passed in review by General M'Clellan, at Washington, on the 20th of November. The troops consisted of seventy-six regiments of infantry, seven of cavalry, and seventeen batteries, in all about 70,000 men.</p>

<p>Commerce in Missouri below St. Louis will be conducted by the Federal Government only.</p>

<p>The Fingal had run into Charleston with her valuable and timely cargo. On the other hand, the Federal ships have captured several vessels laden with contraband of war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE POLICY OF EMANCIPATION.</p>

<p>On this question Secretary Smith, a member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has expressed himself to the effect that the views of Mr. Cameron were not those of the Administration.</p>

<p rend="Center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Congress had passed a resolution for removing the seat of Government from Richmond to Nashville, Tennessee. Perhaps one reason for this step is the destruction of the costly bridges on the Virginia and Tenneessee Railroad, which imperils the connection between Richmond and the South-western States.</p>

<p>The Union men of North Carolina formally established a provisional State Government at Hatteras inlet on the 18th ult.</p>

<p>A portion of the people of Kentucky and Missouri have passed Secessionn ordinances.</p>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT DAVIS'S MESSAGE.</p>

<p>President Davis congratulates Congress on the progress of domestic manufactures among them. He speaks moderately of the great deeds of the Confederate army and of the high spirit of patriotism with which they are animated. He says:-
<p>A succession of glorious victories at Bethel, Bull Run, Manassas, Springfield Lexington, Leesburg, and Belmont, has checked the wicked invasion which greed of gain and the unhallowed lust of power brought upon our soil, and has proved that numbers cease to avail when directed against a people fighting for the sacred right of self-government and the privileges of freemen. After seven months of war the enemy have not only failed to extend their occupancy of our soil, but new States and territories have been added to our confederacy; while, instead of their threatened march of unchecked conquest, they have been driven at more than one point to assume the defensive, and, upon a fair comparison between the two belligerents as to men, military means, and fiancial condition the Confederate States are relatively much stronger now than when the struggle commenced.</p>

<p>After referring to the occurrences in Kentucky and Missouri, and, acknowleging that the postal service was entirely disarranged, he puts as good a face as possible on the condition of the Confederate treasury, which, however, is evidently driven to the extremity of issuing baseless promises to pay. By constructing forty miles of railroad between Danville in Virginia, and Queensborough, in North Carolina, a third through line of communication could be opened from North to South. He urgently advises Congress to give aid to the company organised for its construction and administration. He scoffs at the very idea of reconstructing the Union. "Our people now look with contemptuous astonishment on those with whom they have been so recently associated. They shrink with aversion from the bare idea of renewing such a connection :"-</p>
<quote rend="blockquote">When they see a President making war without the assent of Congress-when they behold Judges threatened because they maintain the writ of habeas corpus, so sacred to freemen-when they see justice and law trampled under the armed heel of military authority, and upright men insist and innocent women dragged to distant dungeons-when they find all this tolerated and applauded by a people who have been in the full enjoyment of freedom but a few mouths ago, they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility between such a people and themselves. With such a people we may be content to live at peace, but the separation is final, and for the independence we have asserted we will accept no alternative.</quote>

<p>After denouncing the barbarous manner in which the United States have conducted the war, he accuses them of desiring to excite a servile war by the invasion of South Carolina, and warns them that in such a war they would forfeit all claims to be considered as prisoners of war. Of the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell he says.-

<p>The United States have thus claimed a general jurisdiction over the high seas, and, entering a British ship, sailing under its country's flag, violated the rights of embassy, for the most part held sacred, even more among barabrians, by seizing our Ministers whilst under the protection and within the dominions of a neutral nation.</p>

<p>These gentlemen were as much under the jurisdiction of the British Government upon that ship and beneath that flag as if they had been on its soil, and a claim  on the part of the United States to seize them in the streets of London would have been as well founded as that to apprehend them where they were taken. Had they been malefactors, and citizens even of the United States, they could not have been arrested on a British ship or on British soil unless under the express provisions of a treaty and according to the forms therein provided for the extradition of criminals. But rights the most sacred seem to have lost all respect in their eyes.</p>

<p>The close of Mr. Davis's Message is evidently levelled rather at Great Britain and France than at the body he professes to be addressing. On the subjects of the blockade and the growth of cotton he says:-

<quote rend="blockquote"><p>Perhaps we had the right, if see had chosen to exercise it, to ask to know whether the principle, that blockades to be binding must be effectual, solemnly announced by the great Powers of Europe at Paris, is to be generally enforced or applied only to particular cases.</p>

<p>When the Confederate States, at your last session, became a party to the declaration reaffirming this principle of international law, which has been recognised so long by publicists and Governments, we certainly supposed it was to be universally enforced. The customary law of nations is made up of their practice rather than their declarationse, and if such declarations are only to be enforced in particular instances at the pleasure of those who make them, then the commerce of this world, so far from being placed under a general law, will become subject to the caprise of those who execute it or suspend it at will. If such is to be the course of nations in regard to this law, it is plain that it will thus become a rule for the weak and not for the strong.</p>

<p>Feeling that such views must be taken by the neutral nations of the earth, I have caused the evidence to be collected which proves comp letely the utter inefficiency of the proclaimed blockade of our coast, and shall direct it to be laid before such Government as shall afford us the means of being heard.</p>

<p>But, although we should be benefitted by this enforcement of this law, so solemnly declared by the great Powers of Europe, we are not dependent on that enforcement for this successful prosecution of the war. As long as hostilities continue the Confederate States will exhibit a steadily increasing capacity to furnish their troops with food, clothing, and arms. If they should be forced to forego many of the luxuries and some of the comforts of life, they will at least have the consolation of knowing that they are thus daily becoming more and more independent of the rest of the world. If, in this process, labour in the Confederate States should be gradually diverted from those great Southern staples which have given life to so much of the commerce of mankind into other channels, so as to make them rival producers instead of profitable customers, they will not be the only or even the chief losers by this change in the direction of their industry.</p>

<p>Although it is true that the cotton supply from the Southern states could only be totally cut off by the subversion of our social system, yet it is plain that a long continuance of this blockade might, by a diversion of labour and investment of capital in other employments, so diminish the supply as to bring ruin upon all those interests of foreign countries which are dependent on that staple.</p>

<p>For every labourer who is diverted from the culture of cotton in the South, perhaps four I times the number elsewhere, who found subsistence in the various employments growing out of its use, will be forced also to change their occupations.</p>

<p>While the war which is waged to take from us the right of self-government can never attain that end, it remains to be seen how far it may work a revolution in the industrial system of the world, which may carry suffering to other lands as well as to our own.</p></quote>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>

<p>On the San Jacinto outrage the <hi rend="italics">Quebec Chronicle</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Montreal Advertiser</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Hamilton Spectator</hi> declare themselves in a sense hostile to the United States. It is said that there are only two Canadian newspapers which dissent from the general view.</p>

<p>Both the Imperial authorities and the people are preparing for the worst. The former have commenced the erection of new forts at Toronto, the latter are filling up the ranks of their volunteer regiments, and eagerly learning the rudiments of a soldier's profession.</p>

<p>Since the Canadian line of European Steamers have begun to start from the United States' port of Portland the passport system, inaugurated by Mr. Seward, is very troublesome to Canadian travellers. As no one but the Secretary of State is authorised to issue passports, much delay ensues, and many travellers have been forced to remain over for a week with or without their baggage. This conduct on the part of Mr. Seward causes much heartburning among the people who dwell on the north bank of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lord Monck was sworn in as Governor-General of Canada on the 28th ult.</p>

<p>The war in America has hitherto brought many advantages to the industrial interests of Canada. For the first time in history the St. Lawrence route has enjoyed a considerable share of the export trade of the Western States. As a consequence, Montreal has risen to be the second American seaport in the grain and provision business. The canal-boats, warehouses, and elevators on the St. Lawrence line are unable to transact the business which has so suddenly poured in upon them. Canadian imports from Europe have increased, while those of the United States have fallen off more than fifty per cent. The number of immigrants from Europe have increased from 9654 last year to 19,461 this year. The increase of immigrants from both Northern and Sontherns States is in still larger proportion. These American immigrants have established in Canada many small mannfactories. Probably, at least 50,000 souls have been added to the population of the province by immigration in 1861.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> latest intelligence from the United States, although not quite so unsatisfactory as that previously received, still leaves strong grounds for apprehension. There is no disguising the fact that most of the leading journals, and public opinion in that country generally, are against yielding to any demands that may be made by her Majesty's Government to restore the citizens of the Confederate States recently taken by force from the deck of a West India mail-packet carrying the English flag. Looking, at the same time, to the opinion and temper of the English people upon this subject, we see such sufficient cause for alarm that our attention is immediately drawn towards the position of the British colonies in North America, and particularly to the boundary line that separates them from the United States.</p>

<p>It would be useless now to discuss the question as to how the frontier line of Canada and New Brunswick has become what it is, or whether it might not have been, by more judicious management, better than we now find it; but it is certain that the boundary line of the States of Maine and New York does so cut into the British territory that United States' armies may encamp within exceedingly short distance of our principal cities and yet be on their own soil.</p>

<p>Newfoundland being an island, and Nova Scotia nearly one, we may safely calculate on our naval supremacy ensuring them protection from molestation; but with the important province of New Brunswick, the Canadas, and the British North-west Territory, our position is by no means so satisfactory, as in many instances in these latter provinces there is no physical boundary whatever, the British possessions and those of the United States being separated by little more than an imaginary line. The trees have been cut down where it passes through the wilderness, and a few stones have been set up at long distances apart, and that is the only division that marks the territories of two peoples who, though coming of a common stock, speaking the same language, and worshipping God in the same manner, yet are intent only on doing each other the largest possible amount of mischief. There is yet hope that it may not be so, but the threatening aspect of affairs compels us to look narrowly at our position on the frontier.</p>

<p>The city of Quebec, our great stronghold in North America, is only sixty miles from the United States' territory; and River de Loup, the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, and of the Canadian sytem of railways generally, although 120 miles lower down the St. Lawrence, is within thirty miles of the international boundary line.</p>

<p>Montreal, the capital of the Canadas, is only forty-four miles by railway from Rouse's Point at the head of Lake Champlain-a point where the States of New York and Vermont meet. Several of the United States' railways focus to this place, and it will become an important position should war break out: it was so in 1841, a great battle being fought in this neighbourhood, the victory being claimed by the Americans.</p>

<p>From Rouse's Point for neary 300 miles eastward are what are called the eastern townships of Canada-districts containing many important towns and much cleared and cultivated land; these abut upon the States of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, without any marked physical boundary, the St. Lawrence lying on their northern or western edge. West of Montreal, nearly opposite the Canadian town of Cornwall, the boundary line of the United States hits the St. Lawrence, and the river then separates them from Canada until it receives its waters at the outlet from Lake Ontario, many good towns lying on each side of it. On the Canadian banks the principal are Cornwall, Morrisburg, Prescott, and Kingston; on the United States' side the principle town is Ogdenburg, exactly opposite Prescott.  These latter are large and important places, situated pretty much as Gravesend and Tilbury Fort are; both are important railway termini. Prescott is the point of junction of the Giant Trunk Railway with the line to Ottawa, the intended seat of the Government of Canada; while Ogdensburg is connected by railway with Rouse's Point to the eastward and with the New York Central Railway to the southward and westward. Kingston, in Canada, is situated at the point where Lake Ontario pours its waters into the St. Lawrence through a thousand channels formed by a number of beautiful islands. Kingston is a fortified place, and adjoins Fort Henry, a military position second only in importance to Quebec. Fort Henry is built on the site of the old French Fort Frontenac. In a war with the United States this place would become most important as a d&eacute:p&ocirc:t for troops, as well as a naval station, where craft would be built to act upon Lake Ontario and the upper waters of the St. Lawrence. On the north shore of Lake Ontario is situated the large, rich, and flourishing city of Toronto, the capital of Western Canada. It is built close upon the waters edge, is utterly unprotected by art, but nature his done much for it. It is a peculiar characteristic of Lake Ontario to have formed in particular situations long banks of sand and shingle, locally called beaches. At a considerable distance from the shore, in front of the city, is a long narrow bank of this description, upon which batteries could be formed with rapidity, that would effectually protect this important city from all attacks on the lake side, while direct railway communication with Fort Henry would secure it landwards. Toronto, therefore, though apparently so exposed, may be safely expected to take care of itself when the time arrives for its doing so. At the western end of Lake Ontario is situated another large and important city, Hamilton, and protected from all attacks from the lake by a beach similar to that which lies in front of Toronto. A single vessel sunk in the canal which connects the waters of Burlington Bay (on the south shore of which Hamilton is situated) with those of Lake Ontario render it impossible for any vessel to approach within three or four miles of Hamilton. Its dangers, therefore, must be sought for in the oppsitosite direction.</p>

<p>On the south shore of Lake Ontario there are situated several important United States' towns; and between the mouth of the Niagara River and the point where the lake becomes the River St. Lawrence are no lees than six railway termini to lines which are connected with the New York central line. In the Genesee, at Oswego, and Sackett's harbour, in the event of hostilities, armaments would be fitted out to operate upon the opposite shore, in which case Lake Ontario would again become the scene of remarkable naval exploits. Across the lake, nearly opposite to Toronto, and within sight of it on a fine day, upon a high hill, stands the monument recently erected to General Brock, who fell there, after having gained a victory over the American troops.</p>

<p>The international boundary line, having passed up the centre of Lake Ontario to opposite this point, turns suddenly inwards and then follows, the centre of the deep river which enters the lake here, pouring out in one unbroken mass the accumulated surplus waters of the great Lake Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, white and foamy after the great leap they have made at Niagara, only a few miles higher up the stream. The Niagara River is a secure barrier for either nation. It may be crossed at its mouth, it is true, but not with impunity if an enemy occupied the precipitous hills on either side. At the foot of the Great Falls it may also be crossed, but a thousand men having done so could not land if fifty occupying the heights chose to prevent them. A magnificent bridge spans the terrible rush of waters down the gorge of the Niagara- a triumph of engineering skill which the arts of peace have produced, and which, doubtless, the art of war will destroy.</p>

<p>Above the Falls of Niagara the boundary line keeps the centre of the stream until it enters Lake Erie. The north shore of this lake is British, and centains some of the best districts of Western Canada. On the American side is the large city of Buffalo; also, Dunkirk, Erie, Cleveland, and Sandusky, the whole of which are railway termini.</p>

<p>The international boundary line is up the centre of Like Erie and through the River St. Clair and Lake St. Clair into Lake Huron. Between Lakes Huron and Erie the United States and British territory is divided only by a fine navigable river, much like the Thames at Erith; the large American city of Detroit is situated on its west bank and the Canadian town of Windsor opposite to it. The latter is the western terminus of the Great Western Railway of Canada; the former the focus of a system of railways. From the upper end of the River St. Clair, the boundary line divides equally the waters of Lake Huron, and enters Lake Superior through the St. Marie. The larger portion of this lake belongs to the Americans. From its northern shore the line follows the direction of the water communications until it reaches the parallel of 49&deg: north latitude, along which it is continued across the Rocky Mountains until it reaches the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>On the north side of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, adjoining the State of Minnesota, there exists a very valuable country known as the North-west Territory. Although in the occupation of the Hudson Bay Company, it is a tract of exceedingly fine land, and contains some settlements known as the Red River or Selkirk settlements. This is a far-off, outlying property of the British Crown, exceedingly valuable to us, and much coveted by the United States, it has been sadly neglected by its owners, and we may soon find it the most difficult to protect.</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">LTHOUGH</hi> a certain and computed time must elapse before the answer from America shall determine whether bells or cannon will be the fittest ushers to announce the New Year, it is impossible to obtain much serious attention for any other subject. The candidate addressing the crowd, the senator giving in his accounts to his constituents, even the ex-Minister casually complimenting volunteers, at once fix on the American difficulty and submit their hopes or their solutions. Meantime journalists can but speculate and express the united feeling of the nation that we must uphold the honour of the English flag, but that we trust the good sense of the respectable classes in America will dominate over the passionate mob and spare us the terrible necessity of striking a blow. From the French papers we cull little save the expression of French opinion upon the outrage for which we have demanded redress, and it is satisfactory to see that the logical minds of the Parisian journalists, when permitted fair play, at once lead them to the conclusion that England had but one course open to her. Deeply interesting as would be at any other time the debates in the Italian Parliament and the situation of Baron Ricasoli and his Ministry, the fiery elegance or languid pedantry of the speakers is little heeded, nor can much indignation be spared for the atrocious cruelties which, if accounts be true, are being perpetrated upon the unfortunate Poles, in punishment for their recent demonstrations of love of country. All this negligence of all but one subject should be noted across the Atlantic, for it is a grim proof how thoroughly England-once aroused-shows herself in earnest.</p>

<p="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>In consequence of the possibility of a rupture between this country and the Federol States of North America the war authorities have exerted themselves with extraordinary vigour to send reinforcements promptly to Canada. The <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> tells us that by to-day (Saturday) 2200 additional troops will be on their way to Canada. This will bring up the strength of the regular forces in the colony to between 7000 and 8000, and we have at home a reserve which, if the necessity should be forced upon us, would enable up to bring 30,000 highly disciplined men at once into the field. At all the dockyards the greatest activity prevails in getting ships of war ready for sea-the number destined for service on the West India and North American station being roughly estimated at about sixty.</p>

<p>Yesterday week the officers, non-commissioned officers, gunners, and drivers, comprising Captain Vesey's E battery of the 4th brigade Royal Field Artillery, assembled on parade at Woolwich, and after inspection proceeded in marching order from the garrison to the Royal Arsenal, for embarkation on board the screw steam-vessel Melbourne, for Canada. The streets in the line of march were crowded with spectators, and the force, which was preceded by the full band of the regiment and numerous field officers, was repeatedly cheered by the public, and especially on entering the main gate of the Royal Arsenal, where a multitude had assembled. The force immediately embarked from the Royal Arsenal jetty on board the Melbourne, which has shipped during the week the following amount of war stores-viz., two complete batteries of Armstrong guns, several howitzers, 30,000 stand of arms and accoutrements, 2,500,000 rounds of Mini&eacute: rifle balls and smallarms ammunition, 1500 rounds of Armstrong-gun ammunition, cartridges, &c. She also takes out military clothing and a quantity of stores peculiarly adapted for Canada, including a number of snow-sleighs, which the wheelers and carpenters of the Royal carriage department were working day and night to manufacture during the week. The Melbourne was under orders to sail in the evening, but an order was received to increase by a large number the supply of sleighs for the transport of guns, &c., and an additional number of workmen were consequently employed during the night. The embarkation scene is depicted on p607, and on page 612 we give an Engraving of one of the sleighs for the transport of guns. The Melbourne sailed on Saturday at half-past two p.m. The long and spacious platform of the Royal Arsenal Pier was thronged during the process of getting under way by officers of the garrison and their families. As soon as the ship had veered round from her moorings and was fairly on her course the spectators gave a hearty "God speed!" which was immediately followed by the waving of caps and handkerchiefs and shouts of applause. The shouts then commenced on board, and were repeatedly heard when the Melbourne was far down the Thames, testifying in a perfectly unmistakable manner to the feelings of the troops. Besides the ordinary warm clothing which was sent out in the Melbourne, each man will be provided with the following articles :-A fur (sealskin) cap, two flannel waistcoats, a pair of fur gloves, six pair of Canada boots, two pair of woollen stockings, a comforter, and a chamois leather jacket. Sonic 3000 moccasins and snowshoes will also be sent as soon as they can be procured. The 30,000 Enfield rifles conveyed by the Melbourne are intended for the Canadian militia. This excellent force, numbering now some 30,000, and capable of being increased to 200,000, was organised during the Crimean War. The volunteer movement has also taken deep root in Canada, and as almost every village contains an old military officer, their drilling and organisation have been well looked after.</p>

<p>Other ships will speedily follow the Melbourne with similar freights. In addition to the Persia and Australasian, each of which will take out about 1200 men, the Government have decided upon chartering six large steamers for the purpose of carrying troops and stores to Jamaica, Bermuda, and Halifax. The Persia and Australasian are being rapidly fitted for the conveyance of troops, stores, and ammunition, and it is expected they will be ready to sail about the 14th or 15th inst. Each of them is to carry out a complement of 1100 soldiers, 5000 stand of arms, and 300 tons of stores. Besides these each is to take out a field battery and a large quantity of ammunition.</p>

<p>It has been determined to send out a considerable number of non-commissioned officers to assist in the organisation of the Canadian militia-cach regiment at Aldershott having been called to furnish three volunteers for this duty. It is stated that in some regiments as many as thirty sergeants have volunteered.</p>

<p>Colonel Napier, Deputy Quartermaster-General in Canada, is placed on the Staff in that colony, with the rank of Major-General. He is succeed as the Deputy Quartermaster-Genera1 by Colonel Mackenzie, C.B., who was on the China Staff. Colonel Lysons will be the Adjutant-General of Militia for the colony.</p>

<p>On Sunday week a large number of mechanics and labourers were employed at the Tower of London in packing firearms and every kind of article which is required for active service. Another order was received on Saturday last to prepare 25,000 more rifles, which were duly packed and conveyed in barges to the Government d&eacute:p&ocirc:t at Woolwich, where they were placed on board the several vessels which are about to depart for Canada. The large gunmakers at the east end of London are working night and day to execute large numbers of rifles, and each contractor has to supply a certain number daily, which are tested at the proofhouse and then sent to the Tower for exportation.</p>

<p>On Monday the fleet battalion of the Grenadier Gaurds were inspected at the Tower previous to their embarkation for Canada. This whole of the men have undergone medical examination, and those found infit for active service have been rejected.</p>

<p>By order of the Lords of this Admiralty, Commodore Nicolson, of H.M.S. Fisgard, the guardship for the port of London, has issued notice that all members of the Royal Navy temporarily borne on the books of the Fisgard from ships that have been paid off, and who have been granted one month's leave of absence, are to rejoin immediately. Similar orders have been sent to all the outports, and all leave of absence is for the present suspended in the Royal Navy. The entry of able and ordinary seamen for her Majesty's service is being vigorously prosecuted, and the Royal Naval Rendezvous, Towerhill, which has been closed for some months, is to be reopened to receive men desirous of joining the service. From the returns recently made by Captain Brown, principal registrar of the Reserve of Naval Volunteers, it appears that the tootal strength of the corps ic 7646 men. 180 of the number holding certificates of competency as masters and mates, and 1050 being competent to act as petty officers-all of whom are ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The total number of men available in our naval reserve is estimated by the <hi rend="italics">United Service Gazette</hi> at 21,231. The following is a detail of the several reserves on the lst instant:-Coastguard on ships' books for shore duty, 232 officers, 3386 men-3618. Ships' crews, 227 officers, 1763 men, and 719 boys-2709. Tenders' crews, 107 officers, 574 men, and 166 boys-847; marines, 510. Total, 7174. Old reserve force: 26 officers, 1108 men. Naval coast volunteers, 7768. Naval reserve force, 7440.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at various military stations in Ireland for completing the strength of sixty-nine regiments of the Line. Recruiting for that purpose will commence immediately.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> says that we could quadruple the force now and about to be under Admiral Milne, on the North American station, without any apparent effort. We could, besides heavy line-of-battle ships, frigates, corvettes, sloops, and gun vessels, spread over the seaboard of the Northern States no less than fifty screw gun-boats, each armed with heavy Armstrongs (they are all ready), to be followed by another hatch of fifty, if the first required support. The total force which we could place under Sir Alexander's orders wherewith he could open the ball would be, supposing the Mediterranean fleet furnished its quota, eleven line-of-battle ships, mounting 975 guns, manned by 9580 men; ten frigates, mounting 447 guns, manned by 5150 men; five heavy corvettes, mounting 105 guns, manned by 1360 men; and seventeen sloops and smaller vessels, mounting together 93 guns, manned by 1493 men; making a grand total of 1527 guns, end 12,436 men. In addition to the men now mentioned, the Donegal, Conqueror, and Sanspareil have on board a battalion of marines in the highest state of discipline.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> of Wednesday has a brief leader to the following effect:-Various statements, all more or 1ess inaccurate, having been made respecting the reinforcements for the protection of our interests in North America, it may be well to mention the steps actually taken for that purpose. The following troops have been ordered to Canada in the Persia,tho Australasian, and the Melbourne, of which the Melbourne has sailed:- Two battalions of infantry of the Line, two batteries of Field Artillery, one company of Royal Engineers. And we understand that arrangements are being made for forwarding to British North America at once two battalions of Guards, four battalions of infantry of the Line, three batteries of Field Artillery, five batteries of Garrison Artillery, two battalions of Military Train, and two companies of Royal Engineers. The two battalions of the Guards under orders are the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards, now at the Tower, and the second battalion Scots Fusilier Guards, at Wellington Barracks. The Rifle Brigade and first battalion of the l6th are in course of embarkation, and the following battalions are held in readiness- viz., the first of the 15th, 96th, and second of the 16th Regiments.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> page 611 we give an Illustration of a torchlight procession at Washington by Blenker's Brigade to celebrate M'Clellan's promotion to the command of the Federal Army. The central figure on horseback is General Blenker. The <hi rend="italics">New York Tribune</hi> gives the following account of the Blenker procession:- "Three thousand Germans of General Blenker's division constituted a torchlight procession on Monday evening, November 11, and, with regimental bands and fireworks and coloured lights, marched to General M'Clellan's house to celebrate his promotion. Transparencies and pyrotechnic pieces of the most beautiful designs were added to the attraction. All Washington was out to see. The crowds soon demanded the American stimulus of a speech, and the calls for Secretaries Cameron and Seward brought them to the balcony. They briefly addressed the crowd. Calls were then made for General Blenker, who said :- 'Citizens and Sojers,-I will say a few words, and it shall be few. If ever I find the enemy I will fight tousands, and tousands of us will fight better as I speak this noble English' (Immense cheering). Cries were made continually for General M'Clellan, but he merely appeared at different times upon the balcony, and bowed to the crowd of soldiers and civilians that filled the street from one side to the other. Within his house the General extemporised a generous collation, and gave a warm welcome to the officers who swarmed in to take him by the hand. The whole testimonial was a splendid success, and is due entirely to the spirit and liberality of General Blenker and his staff."</p>

<p>The special correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> at Washington writes as follows respecting this demonstration:-"The prettiest sight I have seen since I crossed the Atlantic was the torchlight procession got up by General Blenker and his Germans in honour of Major-General M'Clellan on his promotion to the command of the Army. It was something like a Burschen procession, but it exceeded very much any displays of the kind in the number of torchbearers and the variety of colour and effect. The camp of the Blenker men-famous for lager beer and quaint pipes, also for perverted notions respecting the <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> of Unionists and the <hi rend="italic">tuum</hi> of Secessionists-lies some miles across the Potomac, in the valleys and dells of the 'old dominion,' which is nearly as old as Canada,and is meeting with very rude treatment in its primitive antiquity. From it they came in a grand procession, with bands playing and rough chorus-singing, and filed over the Longbridge in a dancing stream of fire-blue, green, red, yellow, orange, and dazzling white. The air was still, the night fine, and nothing could have been more successful than the fireworks in their way, or the impression produced by the stream crested with fire, which first glowed like a torrent of lava, then gradually broke its particles into a broad ribbon of nebulous flames, which, coming nearer, was resolved into balls of diverse-coloured light, and, thus winding on, thinned away into a narrow stripe of orange-like molten iron running through the black courses of the mould. The 'Dutchmen' pursued their career by Pennsylvania-avenue, past the State Department, and, turning in at the gates of the White House, treated the President to a sight of the demonstration intended for his benefit."</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the retirement of General Scott, on the 31st of last October, General M'Clellan was formally declared Commander-in-Chief of the Federal forces, of which he had been for some time the actual head. George M'Clellan was born at Philadelphia in December, 1826, and destined for the military service. In his sixteenth year he was sent to West Point, and left it in 1846, as Second Lieutenant in the Engineers, to take part in the Mexican War. His bravery in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco gained him promotion, and at the storming of the forts of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec his conduct was so brilliant that it gained him his captaincy. After the peace he was appointed a teacher at West Point, where he wrote a manual of the art of war, which is highly esteemed by American soldiers. After this he built Fort Delaware, and then was ordered to Texas and New Mexico to make a topographic survey of the district through which the Pacific Railway was to run. This difficult task was interrupted by a summons to Washington, where the military department had selected him, in conjunction with Major Mordecai and Captain Delafield, to go and witness the operations in the Crimea, which excited as great interest in America as they did in Europe. As there was no prospect of active service on his return home, M'Clellan determined to leave the army, and accepted the post of technical director to the Illinois Central Railway, which he held for several years with credit. In this position the outbreak of the civil war surprised him, and, as he was universally respected and known in the West, he was at once called to a high post. The Governor of Ohio appointed him Major-General and chief of the militia of that State ; but by the recommendation of General Scott he was made Major-General of the regular Army, and intrusted with a most important command in Western Virginia. After the defeat of the Federal army at Bull Run, M'Clellan was summoned to Washington to take supreme command. A Washington letter describes the enthusiasm felt by his men for General M'Clellan:- "General M'Clellan (it states) is one of the least pretentious of men; he generally wears the simple blouse of the rifleman, with not even the starred shoulder-straps to denote his rank; a man who never wastes time-who is indefatigable in his pursuit and attack of the enemy, and equally untiring in his efforts to secure the utmost comfort of his men compatible with the circumstances of a soldier's life. When his line is on the march he is ever among the men, with a kind and cheering word for every company-a pleasant look, or kind salute, or hearty grasp of the hand for every officer or private with whom he is brought on speaking terms by business; and in a fight he is always at the front of the column, in the thickest of the danger, encouraging his soldiers by cheering word and fearless deed. He takes soldier's fare with the rest, asking no better food, and no more luxurious bed than the newest-recruited private under his command. If he sees a man without proper shoes or clothing he has that man with his Captain sent to his own quarters, where the man is served with the garments he needs and the Captain receives a reprimand that leads him to look more closely after the comfort of his men in future."</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Bohemian, from Portland, we have New York telegrams to the 7th inst. Congress assembled on the 2nd, and immediately passed resolutions thanking Captain Wilks for his arrest of the "traitors" Slidell and Mason. Resolutions were also voted which requested the President to confine these two gentlemen in the cells of convicted felons until Colonels Corcoran and Wood should be treated as prisoners of war. Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, offered a series of resolutions declaring that the war is waged simply for the re-establishment of the Union, but insisting upon the right of the President to emancipate all persons held as slaves in any militay district in a state of insurrcetion, and advising such a course. The House refused to veto the resolution-by seventy against fifty-six-but its consideration was postponed for a week. In the Senate Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, gave notice of a bill to confiscate the property of rebels and to give freedom to persons in the Slave States. On the second day the President's Message was received and read, and the reports of the several Departments of State were handed in to the Senate and house of Representatives, except that of the Secretary of the Treasury, which would not be ready for a few days. Subsequently, Messrs. Breckinridge and Burnett, of Kentucky, were expelled from Congress; and a committee had been appointed by the House to inquire into the expediency of abolishing slavery in the district of Columbia.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT'S MESSACE.</p>

<p>After congratulating the country on its abundant harvests, the President refers to the foreign relations of the Republic in these terms:-</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p>You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefy turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factions domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them.</p>

<p>The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, said treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especially the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a second argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it.</p>

<p>The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, to the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation produces more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign States, because, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of our Government mainly depends, not upon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign Powers, averting causes of irritation, and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honour. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defences on every side, while, under this general recommendation, provision for defending our coast line readily occurs to the mind. I also, in the same connection, ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortications and d&eacute:p&ocirc:ts of arms and munitions, with harbour and navigation improvements at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defence and preservation.</p></quote>

<p>The President preserves a judicious silence on the affair of the Trent and San Jacinto.</p>

<p>On the vital subject of emancipation by the right of war, he uses the following guarded yet significant language:-</p>

<quote rend="blockquote">In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the last Session for closing those ports. So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the Act of Congress to confiscate property, and for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.</quote>

<p>The appropriations for the service of the next fiscal year are computed for a force of 500,000 men. He says he has a surplus of cavalry, and will reduce that expensive arm of the service. Although Congress only authorised a levy of 500,000, the Secretary could have raised 1,0OO,0OO of men as easily as not. The rapidity with which the Army, which in April amounted to 16,000 regulars, developed into a force of 640,000 surpasses anything of the sort exhibited by France when her destinies were in the hands of Napoleon. He has no doubt that, in case of emergency, the United States could send into the field a force of 3,000,000 of armed men. "The effort to restore the Union" is termed "the most gigantic endeavour in the history of civil war." The check of Bull Run gave no discouragement, and merely postponed the campaign for a few months. The possession of Western Virginia, and the occupation of Hatteras and Beaufort have, moreover, already redeemed "our transient reverses." Mr. Cameron alludes to the urgent need which the army had of a supply of improved firearms. The resources of the United States' armoury at Springfield being quite inadequate to the occasion, contracts were made with private establishments, and a special agent was sent to Europe to purchase 2,000,000 dols. worth. The Government ought to have in store never less than a million of muskets, and a corresponding proportion of arms and equipments for cavalry and artillery. On the subject of the coast defences he says:-</p>

<p>It is of grest importance that immediate attention should be given to the condition of our fortifications upon the seaboard and the lakes, and upon our exposed frontiers. They should at once be placed in perfect condition for successful defence. Aggressions are seldom made upon a nation ever ready to defend its honour and to repel insults; and we should show to the world that, while engaged in quelling disturbances at home, we are able to protect ourselves againat attacks from abroad.</p>

<p>He recommends that the accommodations at the celebrated Military Academy at West Point, which now contains only 192 cadets, be enlarged so as to allow of the education of 500 trained officers. He suggests that the distinction between regulars and volunteers should be abolished. He admits that recruiting for the regular army has been a failure. He demands that another line of railroad be constructed from Baltimore to Washington, as absolutely necessary for the supply of the troops in the event of the Potomac being closed by ice or a blockade. The paragraphs favourable to the arming of the slaves are printed in some of the New York journals, although they were stricken out by Mr. Lincoln himself, after Mr. Cameron had refused to expunge them with his own hand.</p>

<p rend="center">REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.</p>

<p>Secretary Welles reports that the navy was called upon to blockade a coast line of nearly 3000 miles to keep the navigation of the Potomac open, to organise combined military and naval expeditions against points of the Southern coast, and to pursue the privateers. When the vessels now building and purchased of every class are armed, equipped, and ready for service the condition of the navy will be as follows:-

<p rend="center">THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair announces that he has accepted the offer made in 1857 by Great Britain for a reduction of the international rate between the two countries on letters from 1s. to 6d., which, however, has not yet gone into operation, as it awaits the response of the British office. The excess of expenditure over receipts in 1861 was 5,391,000 dols.; the estimated deficiency in 1862 is 3,145,000 dols.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General defends his conduct in excluding "peaceparty" journals from the mails. He finds his views supported by the authority of the late Chief Justice Story, whose opinion he quotes.</p>

<p>Mr. Thurlow Weed, who is at present in this country, contradicts the statement that General Scott has returned to America in obedience to an urgent request from his Government. Mr. Weed states that the veteran General has gone back to Washington solely from a desire to be "at his post." at a time of "threatened danger."</p>

<p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">AST</hi> week it seemed difficult to obtain attention for any subject save that of the American crisis. "Who can tell what a day may bring forth?" To-day, in the presence of the heavy affliction with which it has pleased the Almighty and Inscrutable to visit our beloved Sovereign and the nation, even the solemn situation in which we have been placed by the piratical act of the Americans is momentarily disregarded while we seek to realise the sudden sorrow. But the record of the week must be duly completed.</p>

<p>President Lincoln's Message, as a composition, is conceived in the same low moral tone and executed with the same maladroitness which have characterised the preceding State Papers of his Government. But such considerations are of small importance compared with the indications of policy afforded by the document. There is no mention of the Trent outrage. From this circumstance, and from a meaningless declaration that the president does not desire hostilities with England, some sanguine writers have hastened to assume that the act of Captain Wilks will be disavowed, and the Southern Commissioners handed over to us. It is urged that Mr. Lincoln did not deem the act of the American Captain as worthy of notice in the Message, or that it is one upon which England has but to express her feeling to obtain immediate atonement. And this view is supported by reference to the fact that an actual wrong to British subjects is mentioned, and Congress is recommended to make compensation. We should be too happy to believe that so wise a course was that designed for adoption by the American Government, but we are afraid to resign ourselves to so agreeable a hope. It contradicts the general expression of that part of the American public which makes itself heard, and which exercises a fatal control over the so-called government of the American press (with one or two honourable exceptions), and of the American Secretary of State. The House of Representatives has deliberately offered a vote of thanks to the pirate Wilks; and though it is technically true that this is not precisely the same thing as a vote of our House of Commons, it is equally true, and more to the purpose, that the House of Representatives expresses the sentiments of those who, to the disgrace of the higher classes in the States, are permitted to engross political power. In the face of all these demonstrations, to say nothing of an official utterance by the head of the Federal Navy, we dare scarcely believe that the despatch of Earl Russell will receive the only answer which we can accept. Still we have only to wait and hear. Our next Impression will, in all probability, contain the expected intelligence. The news regarding the struggle between the North and South merely states that General M'Clellan has not moved, "nor will he move until he is certain to win "-a somewhat indefinite date. We learn with something akin to disgust that the barbarous reprisal system is likely to come into effect, that prisoners are being cruelly treated, and may be actually executed in cold blood-facts which reduce a war to an abominable brigandage. The North, in its excess of zeal for civilisation, is also elaborately destroying harbours in the South, thus by savage acts giving the lie to the profession of belief that the territory to which the harbours belong will ever again be a portion of the Federal dominions.</p>

Two line-of-battle ships, the Algiers, 89, and the Queen, 80, and a gun-boat, the Alacrity, 4, have already left; and two other liners, the Agamemnon, 91, and the James Watt, 91, and another gun-boat, the Foxhound, 4, will leave for the same destination as soon as they are ready for sea, probably about Saturday next. The sloop Firebrand, 6, which arrived here on the 8th from Gibraltar, was ordered back again immediately, and left on the 9th. Two frigates, the Amphion, 36, from Messina, and the Liffey, 51, from Corfu, have been likewise ordered off by telegraph for the Straits. It is reported that the naval force now assembling there in such haste will be still further augmented by some of the ships from the coast of Syria.</p>

The accompanying Illustration, from a Sketch by our Special Artist in the Federal camp, shows a skirmish which took place a short time ago near Fall's Church, Virginia, between a body of the 14th New York (Brooklyn) Regiment and a troop of Confederate cavalry. The 14th were surprised while out foraging, and, after a smart skirmish, both parties separated, the Confederates, who lost three men, carrying off with them thirty-six prisoners and six waggons. The remainder of the 14th fell back on their supports with their wounded, leaving some dead on the ground.</p>

The boundary line is straight at this point, but afterwards becomes exceeding crooked, following the courses of streamlets and a portion of the River St. John. Where the line passes through the wildernesses the trees have been cut down so as to leave an open avenue-stone posts being set up at intervals. A short distance north, on the Canadian side of this line, are situated good towns and villages, being the eastern townships of Canada. Between them and the United States there exists no physical barrier: we may, therefore, assume that in the event of war it is upon this portion of the
colony that the first blow will fall.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the City of Baltimore we have telegrams from New York to the evening of the 13th inst. Congress has not done anything of importance except to pass a resolution in favour of the adoption of measures for an exchange of prisoners. The President has refused for the present to furnish that body with the correspondence between the Federal Government and foreign Powers relative to the European intervention in Mexico.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S DIPLOMACY.</p>

<p>A mass of correspondence between Mr. Seward and the American Ministers in Europe has been presented to Congress. The matters treated of relate to the concession of belligerent rights to the Confederate States, at which Mr. Seward is highly offended, and to the adhesion of the United States to the Declaration of the Congress of Paris relative to maritime rights, an adhesion which Great Britain and France would only receive without prejudice to the rights of the seceded States, and which was therefore withdrawn by the United States. The dispatch of reinforcements to Canada was also complained of, but justified on the ground of the distrust of the United States' Government entertained by that of Great Britain and of the vague menaces uttered by Mr. Seward.</p>

<p rend="center">THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 0F THE TREASURY.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase in July estimated the expenditure of the current fiscal year (July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1862) at 318,520,000 dollars; but, in consequence of the increased number of men levied for the army, his amended estimate is raised to 532,520,000 dollars. Of this aggregate he has already raised by loans the sum of 197,243,000 dollars. The revenue, which he had estimated would produce 80,000,000 dollars, had, partly owing to Congress refusing to pass measures he had recommended, and partly owing to the depression of trade, so fallen off that he only expected to receive 54,500,000 dollars from it. For the purpose of filling up the deficit, the Secretary recommends the confiscation of the property of rebels, whether found in the loyal or disloyal States, but his main reliance is on loans and taxation. He recommends that the duty on brown sugar should be increased to 2&fract12:  cents per pound, on clayed sugar 3 cents, on green tea to 20 cents, and on coffee to 5 cents. He further recommends that the direct tax be increased, so as to produce 20,000,000 dollars from the loyal States alone, and not only their proportion of the same, on the fiction that all the States were loyal. He has a plan of excise and stamp taxes. He proposes duties on stills and distilled liquors, on tobacco, bank-notes, on carriages, legacies, evidences of debt, and instruments for the conveyance of property and other like subjects, such as will produce 20,000,000 dols. more. From the 3 per cent income tax he hopes to procure ten millions more. The whole direct and indirect taxes will thus produce 90,000,000 dols. This sum is small compared with the aggregate property and annual earnings of the people.</p>

<p>The Secretary's great resource lies in supplanting the banks. Their circulation in the loyal States and Western Virginia amounts to about 150,000,000 dols. He argues that this currency is a loan from the people to the banks, costing the latter nothing but the expense of issue and redemption and the interest on the specie kept in hand. These advantages ought to be transferred from the stockholders of the banks to the national Government. He claims to find authority in the United States' Constitution for this measure, under the powers to regulate commerce and the value of coin. His method of issue is to hand this national currency to the banks, who shall secure their redemption by pledge of United States' stocks and an adequate provision of specie. The people will thus have a uniform currency and the Government enjoy the advantages of a loan without interest. The competition of local bank-notes is to be annihilated by a special tax. He estimates the specie now in the United States at 275,000,000 dols. Existing Acts of Congress enable the Secretary to raise 75,000,000 dols. more than he has yet raised on bonds and Treasury notes payable on demand, and 50,000,000 dols. more must be raised by another loan.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year 1863 no reliable estimates can be made. The Secretary hopes that the present war will be over before midsummer; but in order to be prepared for all eventualities he submits estimates based on the hypothesis that the war will continue. These estimates (including 43,000,000 dols. as interest on debt) amount to 475,331,000 dols., of which 95,800,000 may be raised by revenue, leaving a balance to be provided for of 379,531,000 dols. On July 1,1862 the Public Debt will be 517,373,000 dols., and on the above hypothesis 897,373,000 dols, on July 1,l863. He thinks the loyal States alone could pay off this latter sum in thirty years. Of the 72,000,000 dols. worth of bullion deposited in the United States' Mint in 1861, 37,000,000 dollars came from Europe. The Secretary closes his report by recommending the adoption of an international decimal system of weights, measures, and coins.</p>

<p>The bankers and financiers do not relish the propositions of Mr. Chase, so far as they relate to the suppression of the bank currency.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federals were about to occupy Tybee Island, at the entrance to the Savannah River.</p>

<p>Federal accounts state that the late artillery duel at Fort Pickens resulted in no harm to the fort, but that Warrington and part of the Pensacola Navy-yard were burnt.</p>

The connection between Formica viatica and Atta cephalotes is very remarkable. M. Roussel informed Dr. Nylander that both species are common in Algeria, live in numerous societies, and construct their formicaria usually in bank, frequently at roadsides. Fierce conflicts take place occasionally between the Formica and Att&aelig:, the former being always victorious, carrying off numbers of Att&aelig: captive, become henceforth nurse-slaves of Formica viatica. Mr. Bates, who has resided several years in Brazil, states that he not only observed the slave-making ants carrying off pup&aelig: from the nests of more peaceable communities, but also witnessed the slaughter of the more defenceless species. M. Roussel observed Atta cephalotes in great numbers living in perfect harmony in the nests of Formica viatica.</p>

<P>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> attention of the Canadian people at the present juncture (says the <hi rend="italic">Halifax Reporter</hi>) is wisely directed to the all-important question of "national defences." There appears to be a prevalent impression, which is rapidly gaining ground among all classes of people, that they must take immediate measures to provide for the security of the province in case of a sudden invasion from across the borders. The unsatisfactory state of relations between England and the United States brings home forcibly to every intelligent man the necessity of preparing for any emergency. According to late Canadian papers, the military authorities are making their preparations slowly and surely; but still it is obvious that, unless the people themselves afford united assistance, Canada, the upper province especially, would in case of war be in a most perilous position. In Quebec, and other parts of Lower Canada, there are fortifications of an impregnable character; but in Western Canada, with the exception of Kingston, we believe there are none of any importance or strength. The cities of Toronto, Hamilton, London, and the towns of Niagara, Windsor (opposite Detroit), and a hundred other places, would be in most imminent danger if a war were to break out suddenly- during the winter or spring, for instance. All the fighting, in fact, in Upper Canada would have to be done in the open field or behind hastily-constructed batteries and earthworks. The importance, then, of forming a volunteer organisation all through the country is becoming a matter which cannot be disputed by any man of foresight who values the safety of the province. Already there is a general movement made to establish volunteer companies and we are told that "there is every reason to believe that much will be done to place the militia forces of the country on a better footing than they are at present, and thus to make this arm of the service perfectly reliable in case of emergency." The militia, we may mention, in Canada, as well as in all the provinces, is almost a nonentity-little else than an undisciplined mob; and, unless steps are taken to drill and discipline it, it would be useless in the field. This fact is being generally recognised on all sides, and the prospect is that there will soon be a change some way for the better. In Montreal a general calling out of the provincial militia for drill during the winter is spoken of. In Toronto the <hi rend="smallcaps">Leader</hi> is urging upon the officers of the sedentary militia the propriety of resigning their commissions or else taking immediate steps to become acquainted with their drill, and in many places all over the province it is said there is a desire among the sedentary officers to join with the active volunteers in order to learn their drill. Still, the impression amongst men of good judgment and discernment is that there is little reliance to be pleased on the militia, and that the best and surest mode of providing for the defence of the province is to form a volunteer regiment in every locality.</p>

<p>In Halifax (says the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reporter</hi>) the old militia law has entirely gone out of practice and given place to the volunteer system. Nowhere in the British provinces, indeed, have the young men responded more heartily to the call to form themselves into corps for defence than in Nova Scotia; and few, if any, of the colonies can present an equal number of well-drilled and organised companies. Still, however, gratifying as has been the success that has attended the laudable efforts of the promoters of the volunteer movement, a great deal more might be done in the way of increasing the number of the forces all over the country. Both the Lieutenant-Governor and General Doyle, on the occasion of the recent volunteer inspection, very properly made some observations on the importance of obtaining additional strength to the volunteer ranks; and it is to be hoped that their advice will have some effect with the large numbers of young men who have as yet, all over the province, kept aloof from the movement. Very lately, in Bridgetown and Picton, an effort has been made, and successfully too, to form a volunteer company in each of these places: and it would be satisfactory and encouraging to see a similar spirit evinced in every town and village throughout this province. Let this be done, and we would soon, like the mother country, be in a position to present a body of "living walls" that could successfully repel any force that might invade our shores.</p>

<p>At the present moment perhaps no subject is of so much interest and importance as the facilities for the transport of troops over from Halifax to Quebec. The following statement, derived from a gentleman who has recently travelled through New Brunswick, from Quebec to Halifax, will be found interesting:-" On disembarking at Halifax the troops can be conveyed by rail to Windsor, Nova Scotia, about sixty miles, from which point they can take steamers across the Bay of Fundy (which, contrary to popular ideas, is never frozen over) to St. Stephen's, a distance of about 170 miles. From St. Stephen's, a small town of about 4000 inhabitants, there is a railway open to Canterbury, twelve miles from Woodstock, one of the largest towns in New Brunswick. From Canterbury to Woodstock the distance can either be marched over a good snow road or performed in sleighs. From Woodstock a day's journey will convey the troops to Great Falls, a distance of 12 miles, over excellent roads. From Great Falls the next stage is to Lake Port, a small place on the Temiscouta, and thence by sleigh over a very good new military road (which is kept open by the mail track three times a week, and by the operations of the lumberers), they will arrive at the Rivi&eacute:re du Loup. Forty-two miles of this latter portion of the journey, and during which the only practical inconvenience that will be experienced is through a forest district called the Portage, involving an ascent of upwards of 1000 feet. At all the points named the troops could be supplied with refreshments and lodgings in the houses, barns, and outbuildings. The only scarcity with regard to provisions is in the article or flour, as very little grain is grown in the district over which this route passes. There is, however, abundance of beef and other provisions. From the Rivi&eacute:re du Loup the troops will be conveyed by railway, a distance of 115 miles, to Quebec."</p>

<p>Accounts from Kingston, Canada, of the 6th inst., denote much activity in military and warlike preparations. General Sir Fenwick Willliams, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Robertson, Royal Engineers, and the members of the Staff, had made a thorough inspection of the facilities for fortifying Toronto. Guns of heavy calibre were to be placed along the margin of the bay in the vicinity of the Nadaud Old Forts. Workmen were immediately to commence repairing the blockhouse. The men of the 30th Regiment were busily employed in the use of heavy guns. A party of engineers, Sappers and Miners, had gone to Quebec, and a number of them would immediately be dispatched westward. Mr. S. Cunard had gone to Quebec at the request of the Canadian Government. The 62nd and another regiment were to be sent to this province; and it was thought some arrangement was likely to be effected with the Cunard Company to bring up these troops at least as far as Rivi&eacute:re du Loup before the close of the navigation.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> a few days from the time of our publication England will, in all probability, bemade aware of the intentions of the American Government. If Mr. Lincoln has the courage to act up to his own convictions, and to defy the menaces of an infuriated mob, Messrs. Mason and Slidell are by this time on their way to our shores. But we have no great hope that such will be the freight of the vessel now hastening to Liverpool. It is true that ultimately the Government that shall provoke a contest with England will go down in disgrace when the ignorant and angry myriads who now denounce us are excited to frenzy by the chastisement which, in the event of war, England will inflict. It is true that, in the presence of disasters, no American Government, save that of military despotism, will be able to endure; and therefore that it is a choice of evils which the Lincoln Cabinet has before it. But with a certain class of minds the immediate danger is always more terrible than the remote one, and these are the chances for Messrs. Lincoln and Seward to reckon upon-the possible capital to be made out of a great success by General M'Clellan, and the possible interposition of European Powers between England and the Northern States. Of two evils choose the most distant, is a favourite variation upon a well-known rule; and we are disposed to believe that Mr. Lincoln will prefer to hear the distant cannon of Britain rather than the yell of a mob under the windows of the White house. Therefore we do not look for a message of peace, though we hope for it, so far as hope is consistent with a calm examination of the case.</p>

<p>At the same time we are glad to believe that the French notification will have its weight with the American Government. Nothing can be more distinct than this document, and it points out so lucidly to Mr. Lincoln that Captain Wilks has committed an outrage, that the reasoning must be convincing, whatever the resolutions of the President may be. There can be no doubt of the valuable character of this State paper, inasmuch as it testifies to the European world that the first of the Continental Powers takes the side of England. It may also have the advantage of inducing Mr. Lincoln to reconsider his position and to devise some means of extricating himself from it without the fatal appeal. We speak, of course, of the document, not as if it had been composed at the period at which it was issued, but as the embodiment of a decision which was doubtless perfectly well known to our Foreign Minister when he sent the despatch to America. We cannot suppose that diplomatists acting in concert, as those of France and England are understood to do tarried for the issue of a formal despatch. They must have been in perfect accord at the time the demand of England left these shores; and the President was at once made aware that though England desires no physical aid in any contest into which she may be called to enter, she has, and is glad to have, the moral support of the Imperial Government. We can only say again that we wish to believe Mr. Lincoln strong enough to listen to reason and justice.</p>

<p rend="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The Tower has lately been the scene of great bustle, owing to the preparations for sending military stores to Canada. Night and day, on Sundays as well as other days, men have been engaged packing arms, clothing, and other necessaries to a great amount, which are placed on sailing-barges moored alongside the quays; the stores are taken thence down the river, and shipped on board the transports now off Deptford and Woolwich.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday week a great number of persons assembled at an early hour at the Wellington Barracks, St. James's Park, on the occasion of the departure of the 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards and of the 2nd battalion of the Fusilier Guards for Canada. The 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards, 800 strong, under the command of Colonel the Hon. Hugh Manvers Percy, C.B. (Victoria Cross), assembled, shortly after six o'clock, on the parade at the Wellington Barracks, preparatory to their departure for Southampton. After a due inspection, and after partaking of breakfast, at half-past seven o'clock the battalion left for the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. Owing to the death of the Prince Consort the regimental baud did not accompany the battalion to the station. On their arrival at the terminus the men were told off in fours, and with the greatest facility--the system having been initiated by the late General Torrens-the train started at eight o'clock with its gallant burden; so that the entire battalion, each man carrying his rifle and a cooked ration, left quarters and started by railway to their destinations within half an hour. The men were loudly cheered as they proceeded to the railway. The 2nd battalion of the Scots Fusilier, of the same strength, commanded by Colonel William John Ridley, left the Wellington Barracks at eight o'clock, and pursued the same route--along Birdcage-walk. Great George-street, and across Westminster-bridge. The same excellent arrangements were observed, and without slightest confusion or delay the battalion departed at half-past eight o'clock for its destination. As the detatchments reached the docks on arriving at Southampton, they were received by the Southampton Volunteer Rifle Corps, and escorted to their respective ships by the band. The troops were cheered as they left the docks an immense crowd of persons.</p>

<p>The steamer Adriatic, with the Grenadier Guards, and the Parana, with the Scots Fusilier Guards and the eighteenth company of the Royal Engineers, left the docks about two o'clock in the afternoon and anchored in the river. Both vessels sailed for their destination early on the following morning.The Parana had a berth in the docks close to the Nashville, the Confederate man-of-war. As she was leaving her berth, with the Guards on board, the band struck up the tune, "I'm off to Charleston so early in the morning," The officers of the Nashville were watching the departure of the Parana with apparently considerable interest.</p>

<p>Each soldier destined for Canada, on stepping on board of his transport, finds ready for him two pairs of woolen drawers, one jersey, two merino-under-vests, two pairs of worsted stockings, one comforter, one chamois leather waistcoat, one sealskin cap with ear-mufflers, one pair of sealskin mits, one pair of Canadian boots, and one sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail Company's steamer Magdalena, Captain Woolward, with, the 16th Foot (about 1000 strong) on board, took her departure from Southampton last Saturday afternoon. She is under orders to sail for I Halifax direct.</p>

<p>The Cunard Company's Royal mail steam-ship Asia, which sailed from Liverpool on Saturday for Halifax, carrying the mails for Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada, and other portions of North America, also took out about 470 military passengers, and nearly 200 tons of warm clothing, camping equipment, &c. The military arrived at Liverpool early on Saturday morning by special trains from Woolwich and Aldershott, and they were promptly conveyed in steam tenders to the Asia, lying at anchor in the Sloyne. The Asia sailed about 11:30 a.m., with an easterly wind and every prospect of making a rapid passage to Queenstown. Amongst the military passengers there were the staff for the army in Canada.</p>

<p>The Flying Fish sailed yesterday week for Lisbon, with sealed orders and despatches.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at the camp at Colehester for volunteering for the 15th. 17th, 36th, 47th, 62nd, 63rd, and 96th Regiments, which are destined for Canadian service, and which are short of their full complement of men.</p>

<p>The Government having decided on forming a reserve of troops at Bermuda, for operations in North America, orders were on Sunday received at Chatham for the fifth company of Royal Engineers to hold itself in immediate readiness to embark for Bermuda at an hour's notice.</p>

<p>Admirality instructions were received on Saturday directing the whole of the screw gun-boats attached to the first division of the steam reserve at Chatham to be removed from the several ports on the Medway for immediate service.</p>

<p>The following further arrangements for the embarkation of troops for Canada have been completed:- the Hibernian will sail from Liverpool for New Brunswick, taking the fourth company of the Royal Engineers -5 officers and 120 men; the G (Captian Hoste's) battery of the fourth brigade Royal Artillery, from Aldershott-7 officers and 255 men; the sixth battery of the tenth brigade Royal Artillery (Captain Robinson's), from Woolwich -6 officers and 117 men; a detachment of the  first battalion 15th foot- 4 officers and 147 men. The Canadian mail-steamer will take from Liverpool the seventh battery of the tenth brigade Royal Artillery (Captain Child's), from Woolwich- 6 officers and 117 men; and the eighth battery of the same brigade (Captain M'Rea's)- 6 officers and 117 men; the seventh battery for Halifax, the eighth for Newfoundland, the fifth company of the Royal Engineers for Bermuda- 4 officers and 100 men; and 6 men of the Army Hospital Corps for New Brunswick. The detachment of Royal Engineers under orders to embark in the Victoria will sail in the Calcutta.</p>

Hautefeuille, the learned author of "The History of Maritime International Law," and of "The Treatise on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Nations during Naval Warfare," has just given to the world a careful examination of the various questions involved in the Trent and Nashville cases. M. Hautefeulle divides the subject under three heads: admitting the right of search, he declares that the Captain of the American frigate "violated all the rules relating to the right of search." He asserts, "The reply to the question put is, therefore- First, that in no case can there exist contraband of war on a neutral vessel sailing between two neutral ports. Second, that even if there were contraband of war, the sole right of the cruiser would be to seize the vessel and to carry it into one of the ports of the own country to have it legally sentenced. Third, that persons cannot in any case be considered as contraband of war. Fourth, that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, not being in the military service of the Southern Confederation at the moment of thier arrest, could not be carried off from the neutral vessel in which they were sailing. From these answers it evidently results that Captain Wilks has committed a violation of all the principles regulating international relations." He also decides that President Lincoln has not the right to seize and make prisoners the inhabitants and officials of the Southern Confederation wherever he can find them, although he has the right to regard them as rebels.</p>

<p>M. Thouvenel, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, has addressed the following highly important despatch to the representative of France at Washington:-

<p rend="center">THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE FRENCH MINISTER AT WASHINGTON.</p>

<p rend="right">Paris, Dec. 3, 1861.</p>

<p>Monsieur,-The arrest of MM. Mason and Slidell on board the English packet Trent by an American cruiser has produced in France, if not the same emotion in England, at least great astonishment and an extreme sensation.</p>

<p>Public opinion at once inquired, with anxiety for the consequences, whether such an act could possibly be legitimate, and there cannot be the slightest doubt of the general impression. The act seems to the public so entirely at variance with the ordinary rules of international law that it throws the responsibility exclusively upon the commander of the San Jacinto.</p>

<p>We cannot know yet whether this supposition is well founded. And the Emperor's Government has therefore felt called upon to consider the question raised by the capture of the two passengers on board the Trent. The desire to contribute to prevent a conflict, which is perhaps imminent, between two Powers towards whom it is animated by equally friendly sentiments, and the duty of maintaining-with a view to put the rights of its own flag beyond the danger of attack-certain principles essential to the security of neutrals, have, after mature reflection, convinced the French Government that it cannot remain completely silent under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>If, to our great regret, the Washington Cabinet should be disposed to approve the conduct of the commander of the San Jacinto, they must consider MM. Slidell and Mason either as enemies or as rebels. In either case there would be an extremely regretable forgetfulness of principle, on which we have always found the United States agreed with us.</p>

<p>On what ground, in the first supposed case, can the American cruiser have arrested MM. Mason and Slidell? The United States have admitted, with us, in treaties concluded between the two countries, that the freedom of the flag extends to persona found on board, even though they be enemies, except in the case of military men actually in the service of the enemy. MM. Mason and Slidell were, therefore, by virtue of this principle, which we have never found any difficulty in getting inserted in our treaties of friendship and commerce, perfectly free under the neutral flag of England.</p>

<p>It will not, doubtless, be pretented that they could be considered as contraband of war. What constitutes contraband of war is not, it is true, precisely settled; the limits are not absolutely the same for all Powers; but, as far as regards persons, the stipulations found in treaties relative to military persons clearly define the character of the individuals who alone are liable to be captured by belligerents.</p>

<p>Now, it cannot be necessary to demonstrate that MM. Mason and Slidell can in no way be assimilated to persons in this category. There would, therefore, remain no ground to explain their capture but the pretext that they were bearers of official despatches from the enemy. But this is the place to call to mind a circumstance which overrides the whole case, and shows the conduct of the American cruiser to have been unjustifiable.</p>

<p>The Trent was not bound to it point belonging to either of the belligerents. It was carrying its cargo and passengers to a neutral country; and, moreover, it was at a neutral port that it had take them up. If it were admissible that under such circumstances, the neutral flag did not completely cover the persons and goods transported under it, the immunity of that flag would be a vain word; the commerce and navigation of third Powers would be liable to suffer at any moment for their innocent, or even indirect, relations with either of the belligerents. The latter would not only have a right to require from the neutral the most complete impartiality, and to interdict him from being mixed up in any way with acts of hostility, but they would inflict restrictions upon the liberty of commerce and navigation which modern international law refuses to acknowledge as legitimate. There would be a return, in a word, to those vexatious practices against which, in former times, no Power protested more energetically than the United States.</p>

<p>If the Washington Cabinet should regard the two persons arrested as rebels, whom it has always a right to seize, the question, though shifting its ground, could not be more resolved in a sense favourable to the commander of the San Jacinto. In such a case there would be a contempt of the principle in virtue of which a ship is held to be a portion of the territory whose flag it bears, and there would be a violation of the immunity which forbids a foreign Sovereign to exercise jurisdiction on that territory. It cannot doubtless be necessary to call to mind the energy with which the United States has, on every occasion, defended this immunity and the right of asylum which is a consequence of it.</p>

<p>Without wishing to enter upon a more thorough discussion of the question raised by the capture of MM. Mason and Slidell, I have said enough, I think, to show that the Cabinet of Washington cannot, without infringing those principles which all neutral Powers are alike interested in maintaining, nor without putting itself in contradiction with its own conduct up to the present time, give its approbation of the conduct of the San Jacinto. In this state of things the Cabinet of Washington cannot, in our opinion, hesitate as to the course to be taken.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons is already charged to present the demand for satisfaction which the English Cabinet is under the necessity of making, and which consists in the immediate release of the persons taken from the Trent, and explanations which shall relieve the act of the Captain of the San Jacinto of its offensive character to the British flag. The Federal Government would be inspired by a just and elevated sentiment in yielding to these demands. It is impossible to conceive any object or any interest that it could have to run the risk of provoking a rupture with Great Britain by assuming a different attitude.</p>

<p>For ourselves, who would see in such a rupture a complication in every way deplorable of the difficulties with which the Cabinet of Washington has already to struggle, and a proceeding calculated to occasion serious uneasiness to all the Powers not parties to the present conflict, we think we are giving a testimony of loyal friendship to the Cabinet of Washington in not concealing from it our opinion.</p>

<p>I request you. Sir, to take the first opportunity of speaking frankly with Mr. Seward, and, if he should desire it, to leave him a copy of this despatch.- Receive, &c.,  <p rend="right">T<hi rend="smallcaps">HOUVENEL.</hi></p>

<p>We state for the satisfaction of the relatives and friends of the troops leaving for Canada that the "Persia, and the other large steamers, carry each four boats fitted with Clifford's patent for instantly and safety lowering-them.</p>
