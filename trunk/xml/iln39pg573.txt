<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> one topic of the day is the great question whether American democracy will permit American statesmanship to do right. No other subject has any claim to Present discussion; for it is impossible to talk of social reforms, or other of the ordinary themes of the journalist, when England, making a stand for her honour, but in nowise irritated or unreasonable, awaits the tidings whether the New Year is to be inaugurated by the signal for war. At another time it might be interesting to hear that the Mexicans have resolved not to risk a struggle with the great Powers that have united to put down piracy and ruffianism in Mexico, and to assert the rights of civilisation. We might be glad to know that there was a probability of these objects being effected without bloodshed, and we might urge upon the Governments to be in no hurry to believe in the value of promises extorted by fear, and which must be rendered valuable by material guarantees, and by the condign punishment of those who have been indulging for years in tyranny and robbery. But an expedition which excited some interest a month ago may now sail almost unmarked, except that England casts a not unsatisfied glance at her own share in the ships, and is glad that they are sailing westward. The Indian news is far from uninteresting, but, except that we shall be glad to hear that the Indian cotton crop is likely to be quadrupled, we have not much attention for the Oriental Empire. On Christmas Day many of the gathered households of the country may be graver than is their wont at that season.</p>
<p rend="center">The mother looks on her son to-day 
With a troubled heart and eye, 
And the maiden's brow hath a shade of care
'Mid the gleam of her golden hair;</p>
<p>for news, like that of the German legend, that "the Wild Huntsman hath gone by," and that war is coming, may sadden the homes of England. Yet throughout the length and breadth of the land there is but one cry-We must uphold the old flag.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Number last week contained an account of the forcible seizure of Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Confederate Commissioners to France and England, on board the Trent, by bodies of armed men from the United States' war-ship San Jacinto; and we now give, on the preceding page, an Engraving representing this violation of international law-which will be attended, it is to be feared, with the very gravest consequences. The purser of the mail-steamer Trent supplies the following narrative of the circumstances attending the boarding of that vessel by the Lieutenant and men of the American sloop-of-war San Jacinto and the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners:-
<p>I hasten to forward some particulars of the grievous outrage committed today (Nov. 8)against the English flag by the United States' steam-sloop San Jacinto, Captain Wilks. You have probably heard how, some three weeks ago, the little steamer Theodora, having on board the commissioners sent by the Confederate States of America to London and Paris, ran the blockade at Charlston, arriving safely in Havannah. Once arrived there,they, of course, imagined that on neutral territory they were perfectly free and safe from all molestation, and therefore made no attempt to conceal their names, position, and intendedmovements. Mr. Slidell, the commissioner for Paris, was accompanied by his wife, son, and three daughters, and also by his secretary, Mr. G. Eustis, with his wife, Mr. Mason, the Commissioner for England, being accompanied by his secretary, Mr. M'Farland. It was well known in Havannah that berths were booked for the whole party to proceed by this steamer to St. Thomas, there to join the homeward West India mail steam-ship for Southamton. They accordingly embarked yesterday morning, trusting, to receive the same protection under the English flag which they had already received from that of Spain.</p>
<p>We left Havannah yesterday morning at eight. This morning, about half-past eleven, we observed a large steam-ship ahead, and on a nearer approach found she was hove to, evidently awaiting us. We were then in the narrowest part of the Bahama Channel, abreast of Paredon Grande Lighthouse. As soon as we were well within range we had the first intimation of her nationality and intentions by a round-shot being fired across our bows, and at the same moment by her showing American colours. We were now sufficiently near to observe that all her ports were open, guns run out, and crew at their stations. On a still nearer approach she fired a shell from a swivel-gun of large calibre on her forecastle, which passed within a few yards of the ship, bursting about a hundred yards to leeward. We were not within hail, when Captain Moir, commanding this ship, asked the American what he meant by stopping his ship, and why he did so by firing shotted guns, contrary to usual custom. The reply was that he wished to send a boat on board of us. This was immediately followed by a boat pushing off from the side of the San Jacinto, containing between twenty and thirty men, heavily armed, under the command of the First Lieutenant, who came up on the quarter-deck, and, after asking for Captain Moir, demanded a list of passengers. As his "right of search" was denied, the information required was, of course, peremptorily denied. He then stated that he had information that Messrs.
Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland were on board, and demanded that they should be given up. This also being indignantly refused, Mr. Slidell himself came forward and said that the four gentlemen named were then before him, but he appealed to the British flag, under which they were sailing, for protection. The Lieutenant said that his orders were to take them on board the San Jacinto by force if they would not surrender. He then walked to the side of the ship waved his hand: immediately three more heavily-armed boats pushed off and surrounded the ship, and the party of marines who come in first boat came up and took possession of the quarter-deck; these, however, he ordered down on the main-deck, to take charge of the gangway ports. Captain Williams, R.N., the naval agent in charge of the mails, who was of course present during this interview, then, in the name of her Majesty, he being the only person on board directly representing her, made a vehement protestation against this piratical act.</p>
<p>During the whole of this time the San Jacinto was about 200 yards distant from us on the port beam, her broadside guns, which were all manned, directly bearing upon us. Any open resistence to such a force was of course hopeless, although, from the loud and repeated plaudits which followed Captain William's protestations, and which were joined in by every one, without exception, of the passengers congregated on the quarter-deck, men of all nations, and from the manifested desire of some to resist to the last, I have no doubt but that every person would have joined heart and soul in the struggle had our Commander but given the order. Such an order he could not, under such adverse circumstances, conscientiously give, and it was therefore considered sufficient that a party of marines, with bayonets fixed, should forcibly lay hands on the gentlemen named. This was done, and the gentlemen retired to their cabins to arrange some few changes of clothing. A most heartrending scene now took place between Mr. Slidell, his eldest daughter-a noble girl devoted to her father-and the Lieutenant. It would require a far more able pen than mine to describe how, with flashing eyes and quivering lips, she threw her herself in the doorway of the cabin where her father was, resolved to defend him with her life, till, on the order being given to the marines to advance, which they did, with bayonets pointed at this poor defenceless girl, her father ended the painful scene by escaping from the cabin by a window, when he was immediately seized by the marines and hurried into the boat, calling out to Captian Moir as he he left that he held him and his Government responsible for this outrage.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> attitude and bearing of the people of England under the circumstances which have arisen in connection with the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners on board the Trent have been in all respects worthy of the occasion. This is not the verdict of mere self-complacency, but ample testimony has been borne by the press of France to the mingled dignity, moderation, and firmness of purpose which have been displayed by the whole country, and without exception of class. The bitterest satirists on England and the English have failed to find anything in our conduct on which to base even a sneer; while for an accusation no shadow of a foundation has been discovered. If it were necessary we might quote some of the language of writers in Continental journals in which our national spirit, our unanimity of feeling, and our consciousness of beinginthe right areheld up to admiration in no measured terms; but we only refer to these eulogies for the purpose of illustration, and with no desire to make more of a highly creditable state of things than it deserves. It would certainly have been a melancholy thing if a country like this should on the occurrence of an act of aggression have set about to scold and vapour with all the sound and fury of those, whether persons or nations, who are assured neither of their position nor the rights of the matter in dispute; and therefore, while admitting simply and unostentatiously the justice of any commendation which we have received for our conduct in this juncture of our national affairs, we can afford to be almost surprised thaf'any one should have conceived it could have been other than it has been. It is to be observed that, as the time since the intelligence of the Jncinto affair was

received has run on, the public mind has taken a calmer view of the situation; but, nevertheless, there has not appeared any abatement of the resolute determination to hold to the honour of England at all hazards which was the first sensation that pervaded the land. If there be any change in the view of this question-and we think there is-it is a growing incredulity with regard to the necessityfora resort to the bloody arbitrement of the sword. Reflection, consideration, examination of the subject in all its bearings, seem to lead to something like a conviction that, if a similar process be applied to the question on the other side of the water, it must result in a peaceable issue. The most recent accounts show that some change has come over the spirit in which most of the Federal so-called organs of public opinions deal with this subject. The tone adopted by these journals is much more serious and practical than that which characterised the delivery of opinions on the first blush of the matter; and something has been done to familiarise the popular mind in America with the surrender of the Confederate Commissioners as a contingency by no means remote. Some of them go so far as to say that the recent event cannot-we suppose because it ought notbe a cause of war; and others have allowed that, if the act of the officers of the Federal navy is not justifiable by the law of nations, it cannot inflict any wound on the national honour to make a suitable apology. The signs of the existence of such a feeling, however feeble they may he, are not without significance, and from them may 1)0 drawn auguries of things to come which, we believe, the most sensitive Englishmen would be willing enough to witness. It must be remembered that these indications of a tendency to
concession in America have taken place before there has been any knowledge of the manner in which the affair of the Trent has been received in England. Surely the august spectacle of a nation asnanirnous for the vindication of its honour, and consentancous in its conviction that that honour has been wounded, cannot be without its effect even on a nation so impulsive as the Americans. It is with a full consciousness of all the disadvantages, present

and prospective, to both countries which must follow a war

such as that which we are obliged to contemplate, but ready at all points for even such a contingency, that England awaits the result of the intercommunication between the tvo Governments.

In the mean time, in a spirit of perfect candour, and divesting ourselves of any mere partisanship, it may be worth while to consider some of the disadvantages which this untoward letfor untoward it is from any point of view-is calculated to bring upon the cause for which the Northern States are contending. It is useless to blink the fact that the civil war has assumed a magnitude which probably we in Europe did not contemplate, and which has called forth at the very earliest period all the resources of the North. The visions of a rapid subjugation of the South in one triumphant campaign have laded before the stern reality of the situation; and, while it is broadly stated on all hands on this side of the water that a

restoration of the old Union is assuming the aspect of an impossi-bility, it has been whispered that such an opinion has secretly taken root in the minds of the Cabinet at Washington, and that a contest with England is adopted as a policy out of which may spring a pretext for the ultimate acknowledgment of the independence of the South. If this is really the case, why, all ground for argument is cutaway, and it must be readily admitted that no course more calculated to attain that end could have been selected than that of bringing on a quarrel with this country.

 But disregarding the insinuation that a policy so tortuous underlies the conduct of the advisers of Mr. Lincoln, and assuming that the object of the Federal Government is the rehabilitation of the Union, it is impossible not to see the instantaneous damage that would be done to that object if war 'with England comes to pass. Already we see in the message of Mr. Jefferson Davis indications of the effect which such a dispute would have on the fortunes of the party sf 'which he is the head. His bold assertion of a violation f international law in the case of the Treat is pregnant with suggestion, and its interpretation is that he sees in that act a near prospect of the recognition of the Southern States as an independent Republic by one of the first Powers f Europe Of the moral force of such a declaration on the cause of which he is the apostle there can be little doubt

but if the matter should come to positive hostilities a glance will snfii.'e to show, in the first place, the whole Southern seaboard practically set free from blockade, the cotton trade in full operation, under the practical convoy of the fleets of England, with a corresponding financial effect on the resources of that pint of the American continent ; while, on the other hand, the ports of the North will be fast closed, and an equivalent check placed on the commerce and oujccs of strength and action of the Federal power. This is no idle boast or senseless assertion, for we have the liips, the guns, and, above all, at this juncture of our naval history, we are strong just where we have hitherto been weak

we have the anon, the sailors, without whom all the, vessels of war in the world would be inert masses. Already there comes from the great emporiums of trade and commerce, from New 'York notably, the rumour of mercantile stagnation, and, worse still, the cry of popular distress. Civil war alone has sown the seeds of -paralysis in that national prosperity of which Americans w (re so justly proud, and in the most fortunate future looms a large national debt and years of financial struggle. 'What may not be predicated as the result of a war with a powerful kingdom like England, added to the internecine strife which is now going on in the States? In the interests of humanity and of civilisation and progress one shrinks from the contemplation of the rebound of a quarter of a contnry of a nation which, always a world's wonder, possessed within it so

 yet sec a satifactory, because a peaceful, solution of this vexcd question. England, resolute and prepared for any eventrm'ilify, but more in sorrow than in anger, demnands reparation for an international as well as a national wrong. If site had any choice site would have preferred that any other State of Europe should have undertaken the vimtdicrtion of a prin.. ciple which she holds only in common with other nations. There are special reasons too obvious and too often (iwalt upon which snake a quarrel of this kind in the abstract distasteful to her. lie does not forget "that blood is thicker than water," but she also remembers that the time has been when in a contest for high principles and rights she could hear to see conflict even between brother and brother on her own soil, and, grievous as was the sacrifice, it was a lustration from which she did not shrink. She wihies to shed no kinsman's blood how

let us hope that that feeling will prove to be reciprocal,

CAPTAIN WILKS, OF THE SAN JACINTO.

CAPTAIN Cuanjas 'Wiues, the Men of the hour in the United States was born in the State of New York in 1801, and entered the United States' Navy in 1818. In 1838 lie was corirnissioned by the Federal Government, with the grade of Captain, to take command of a naval expedition to explore the countries bordering on the Pcitic and Southern Oceans. Starting from New York, lie doubled Cape horn, visited the Sandwich, Feejse, and other Polynesian groups, and the coast of Oregon; crossed over to Australia and Tasmania, dercending as low as the Gist degree of south latitude. He visited Singapore and Borneo, and returned to New York in 1842, by way of time Cape of Good Hope. Several courts-martial were held upon hint from whit-I,, however, lie issued without loss of rank. The results of his expedition were recounted in a voluminous illustrated work entitled 11 A Narrative of the United States' Exploring Expedition." In 1818 the Geographical Society of London presented him with a gold medal as a token of their appreciation of his services to science. He has since puiAisiied a work entitled "Western Ametica," which contains statistical and geographical facts and maps relating to the States of the Pacific Coast. He was returning from the coast of Africa, in command of the San Jacinto, when, hearing at hiavannah that the Confederate Coinmissioners intended to take passage in the steamer Trent, lie determined to seize them and any despatches they might have with them. In acting as he did he states that he was guided only by his own notions of his ditty to his country, and that he had no instructions from his superiors at Washington.

THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES.

IN our Issue of this week we give Portraits of Mr. Ma'on and Mr. Slidehl, the Commissioners of the Southern Siats of Aimc;cr, ',vh

were arrested by the officers of the San Jacinto on board the British mail-steamer Trent.

MR. MASON.

This gentleman, the Commissioner to England, b a native of

the State of Virtinia, and is of direct English liscent, this fact of lineage having been nlwsy.s held traditionally in his family. He is the grandeon of George Mason, one of the cost emlebi-ated of the worthies of Virginia, who was the framer and chief supporter of the first Constitution or that State. 'limo subjeut of our pi csent memoir was born in the latter part of the last century, and made his first appearance in public life in 1923, as a menulnr of a Convention of the Southern States which was assemblel for the purpose of carrying our a favourite plan of Washington for opening up the resources of Virginia by weans of a canal lutwcn the Ohio and time Chesapeake Rivers. In 1,927 lie was a men'ior of a Convention under whose au'tpiees the old Constitution of time State of Virginia was altered. In 18 Id lie was elected to the Senate of th

United States, find was afterwards rechosen at every election almost without opposition. Immediately on his Incoming a Senator hm was appointed a member of that important section of time Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee, which position lie held withmomit interruption until his retirement fm-omit that body, and he way for more than ten years the chmtirmmman of that Committee. Jim 18-50 he took part in the discussion which ended in California using declared a Free State, and was one of time seven or right members who, in conjunction with Mr. Jefferson DavP, was in favour of terminating the Convention of the Southern States with time Federal systcimm by their withdrawal from the Union. In politics Mr. Mason has always been a cone' tnt Democrat. He married the daughter of Mr. Benjamin Clmev, is rueniler of a family of some consideiatiom' in the State of Pnn.syl t'.iit. Although not emmdowul with any remarkable energy or brillisimey, Mr. Mason has always shown capecily for affairs; while on his pimsonil character us a gentleman of highs honour and elevated sentiments no slur has ever been attempted to be cast.

MR. SLIDELL.

Mr. Shithehl, the Commiioner to France, was barn in ttre city of New York, and the date of hi birth also belongs to the last century. At a comparatively late period of life he commenced the study of time law, and, having formally embraced the legal profession, he removed to New Orleana, where he practised with great success and accumulated a large fortune by time exercise of t his ability and industry, which, combined with great energy of ritamactee, have always cawed hum to hold a prominent potition in public life. He married the accomplished dtughtrr of a geittleina n of Louisiana, the lady who accompanied him in hi voyage towards

nation which, always a world's wonder, possessed within it so many of the elements of advancement to greatness.

Nor, in considering the consequences of an unfriendly terinistation of the differences between England and the Federal States, can the probable conduct of other nations in Europe he placed out of sight. In the very first rank, of course, must be placed France ; and, if the opinions of the Imperial Government he at all truly indicated, there is little doubt of the line which will be taken by that country. If the arguments of the French journals-even those which, as the phrase goes, are 11 inspired" from the highest quarters-mean anything, they mean that this question is not to be looked at from a merely English point of view at all. It is stated that it is only an accident that the Confederate Commissioners were

eiv.cd under the British flag; for, supposing they had found it convenient to take passage in a French vessel, the officers of the

."an

, .Incinto would have felt themselves equally bound to have captured them under the tricolor. In fact, it is urged that the question is a purely international one, and one on which it is impossible but that the opinion of all the nations of Europe must be consentancoiss. The coons bell! and its immediate vindication rest on England, but the moral force of international opinion will also be brought to hear on the quarrel, and that in direct opposition to the American side of the question. These considerations take the matter wholly out of the comparatively narrow bounds of a captious dispute between England and the Federal States. The question becomes cosmopolitan, and it

bearings rd its consequences assume adequate proportions.

If something of all this, which we have, owing to an earnest desire to enter on the discussion with the utmost moderation,

 erIias too faintly indicated, could present itself to the Jiiecrican as it moat surely does to the English mind, we might

ranter, have aiways (2L1I'UU 11110 LU 110111 prom llililiL I PU 10011 in public life. He married the accomplished daughter of a geittletnan of Louisiana, the lady who accompanied him in hi voyage towards Europe was present at his rapture on board the Trent, and is now residing in this country. Under the presidency of General Jaekon he was appointed District Attorney for the State of Louisiana. He was subsequently elected to Congress for two terms, and perved tito first, but before the second had expired lie was selected as the head of the

mission to Mexico, and continued Minister for the United States in that country until war was declared. In 1853 he was elected a moinhar of the Senate of the United Statci, and occupied that position until the secession of the Southern States. It should be mentioned that when Mr. Buchanan became President he was desirous 01' obtaining the services of Mr. Slidell in his Cabinet, and placed any otlice which might suit his views at his disposal, but that offer was not accepted. Afterwards the acceptance of more than one foreign mission was pressed on Mr. Slidell. and especially time post of united States' Minister to France, but these distinctions he also declined,
