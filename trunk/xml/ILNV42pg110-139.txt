president Davis's Message has been sent in to the Confederate Congress. He complains

that the European Powers declared neutrality without acknowledging the sovereignty of the seceded States; thus injuring the South, and Prolonging the war by admitting the doctrine that the Federal Government had a right to coerce the seceded States. If these States were independent, the refusal to

 :itertsin the Enme international intercourse with them as with the lortil was just, no matter what may have been the motive prompting it. Ho dees net cemlilsia of any treaty being concluded between the United States and Europe for the abolishment of priv steering, although the prohibition to either bslligcrmt to dispose of its pi iase in European ports operated with intense severity against the South, by depriving her of the only means of maintaining, with some approach to equality, a struggle on the ocean.

ifs declares the anxiety at the South for peace, but says that its detestjninatisc against submission is unalterable, He denounces the conduct of the Union armies as atrocious and cruel. Referring to Mr. Lincoln's emancipation treclennstion, be says he may well leave it to the instincts of the coannon enmanity of men of all countries to pass judgment upon a measure by much millions of hnnmcn beings of inferior race, peaceful and contented labonccrs in their sphere, are deemed to extermination, while they are encouraged to cconinit assassination by an insidious recommendation to abstain from -violence unless in self-defence.

- LONDON: SATURDAY, TANITARY 31,1863.

Wn bavo to record another diplomatic incident in the history of the American War. The Emperor of the French has caused a despatch of importance to be sent by his Foreign Minister to It!. Mercier, who repesents France at Washington. It has been called "officious" by the French journals, and it remains to be seen in which of the two senses attaching to the word the Americans will interpret the interference-" officious" implying, according to their own Noah Webster, "kind and obliging," and also "intermeddling in affairs with which one has no concern." Certainly, so far as externals go, there is nothing in the despatch of N. Dronyn de Lhuys to offend the most sensitive nation in the world. The Emperor does not offer mediation, he does not even offer to interfere ; but he dwells upon his friendship for the United States-upon: the pain he feels in witnessing the raging war; declares tat he takes all susceptibilities into account, and merely makes suggestions for a negotiation. He does not ask that the war may be discontinued while such negotiation is is progress. On the contrary, he reminds the North that solthern may go on lighting 'while civilians are debating, and. that the
cessation of strife may be contemporaneous with the adjustmerit of terms. But lie urges that conferences might be advantageously held between the belligerents, who, instead of mutually accusing one another, might discuss the questions which separate them. This, lie represents, would involve no humiliation, would exclude the idea of alien pressure of any hind, and would simply be a practical investigation into reciprocal grievances..

If the Emperor had to do anything, it is difficult to say that he could have done less or put his points more graciously. There has not been time to hear how- the despatch (a copy of which was to be left with Mr. Seward, if desired, according to usage) has been received in America, and it is very hard to speculate upon the course which the strangely-constituted mass called-the American people will take upon any given subject. The American organs here are uninstructed, and are of course fumbling in the dark while compelled to say something; but, nat knowing what to say that may not be repudiated by the next mail, their trumpets give a very uncertain sound, for they themselves know-not whether to blow the signal for battle. But, on the whole, it appears to bethought that-the proposal of the Emperor will be declined, partly on a ground. to which his Majesty himself adverts, and partly on a plea which, obstinate and pedantic as it is, represents an idea that is not altogether to be:treated with disrespect. The ground alluded to by the Emperor is the hope and belief of the North that it is conquering the South, or will be able to do so. His Majesty is too courteous to point out the futility of this notion, or to represent that the North; having been . beaten in nearly every important engagement; and its armies at this moment recoiling from two disastrous attempts upon the principal strongholds of the South, the signs of the war cannot be read favourably for the Federals, even by the most resolute of their prophets. He passes this by, and he also abstains from dwelling upon the second difficulty. The North declares the Confederates to be "rebels," and is enraged at Europe's recognising them as belligerents; and as the doing this must be the first step towards a pacific conference it does not scene very probable that Mr. Lincoln or his Cabinet (two distinct agencies, as the President is unceremoniously told by some of his subjects) will venture upon a measure much more rational than popular. So that although, as we have said, anything like prediction as to the course of the American people would be very hazardous, there does net seem to be any great likelihood of the olive-branch appearing in a French hand.
We have also to hear what the South has to, say. President Davis has been again addressing his people, and his tone is, as usual, temperate but resolute. He complains that the European Powers have refused, to recognise privateering, and thereby have prevented the Confederates from availing themselves of the results of their naval prowess, and he affects to regard this step as a sort of declaration against the South. But he points with justifiable exultation to the successes of the Confederates, and adds that their enemies are now feeling the pressure and hardship which the Slave States have borne so bravely. His note is naturally one of continued defiance. Supposing that Washington should be moved by the representations of the Emperorand we may here observe that some of the Northern journals think that it would not disgrace the Federals to be the first to suggest proposals.-it is perfectly certain that in the present temper of the South the very first demand upon the subject of slavery would be one that would set the still powerful Abolitionist party in a red flame. The slaves of the States in revolt are as free as a piece 'ïf paper can make them, and it is said that a great number of Virginian slaves have actually availed themselves of the notification of New-Year's Day. At all events, some three millions and a half of slaves have been proclaimed free men. The very first article to be submitted to Conference by the South must run in this way :-" The proclamation to be rescinded, the negroes to be formally restored to slavery, and all blacks who may have availed themselves of the decree to be given up to the authorities of their respective States." Will the Abolitionists bear that? For assuredly nothing less will satisfy the victorious Confederates; and, unless

the Washington plenipotentiaries-i± such persons can exist

enter the Conference-room unprepared to assent to this article they had better stay at home, it may be that the South would concede a good deal in return for this article, and for a second which should reaffirm the desirability of slavery and re-enact it for the Confederate States ; for it would be absurd to suppose that the "Chivalry" are not as tired of the fratricidal war as the "Yankees ;" but is it possible for the Abolition party to concede this stultification of themselves, this retraetat'ion of all that they have been so clamorously saying for the last eleven months?

Finally, we may observe that, with recent successes and even in the face of the disaster at Murfreesboro', the tone of the South has become firmer and firmer, and it is even more emphatic than ever in its exultation at the prospect of being freed from the yoke of what it calls the greedy, hard, usurious Yankee. In a word, the South is bent upon the experiment of standing alone, and it is impossible to refuse to it the right of trying that experiment. If the Conference can act upon the principle of separation, it is, of course, the natural method of terminating a hideous strife; but, if not, we fear that the Imperial suggestions are not worth the paper on which they are written; unless, as is not impossible, they may be intended for rejection, and this rejection may be intended to be regarded as a vindication of another step of a different nature.

Tens act of the Federals which took place on the 11th of December last, began the late hostilities on the Bappahasmook which continued for five days-and ended, 55 our readers ore aware, in a decisive victory for the Confederates, At the time chosen by our Special Artist for making the accompanying Illustration (on page 116) the Federals had over 160 gone directed on the town from the heights on the opposite side of the river; and it was under cover of this tremendous cannonade that their troops commenced crossing by three pontoons. Their dense masses can be seen in the distance winding down to the

river. The town is on fire in various places from the shelling, but 300 leiiueiesiupisne still hold their ground as sharpshooters on the Confederate tank, annoyipg the heads of the columns as they appear on the bridges. General Lee's plan, however, as is now well known, was to let the enemy cress end attack him in the strong position m which he had ensconced his forces. The infantry moving along the road in the foreground are proceeding to rifle-pots an front of the battery seen on the hill on the left, which was the first of the Confederate defences and held by Colonel Walter's Washington artillery-of which position more anon.

The attempt of the Federals to carry the first of the Confederate

¥litions on their right-the battery of the Washington BatbaM on.

.Hill, commanded by Colonel Walton-was, as our readers are aware, totally unsuccessful, end most disastrous to then. Immense messes were hurled otintervals on the lull and works, shown m our Illustration; but at each attack they were driven back with cmmenso loss. "From the point where I steed, with Generele Lee and Longstrost," says onrSpecial Artist, writing from the Confederate eamp, "I could see the grape, shall, and canister from the guns of tics Washington artillery mow great avenues in the Masses of Federal troopa roehing to tile aseault, while the infantry, posted behind a breastwork just under the battery, decimated the nearest columns of the enemy. In the distance, Franklin's corps is seen deploying into line of battle on the Federal left. They have some field-batteries thrown forwards shelling the Confederate positions on the wooded range of hills. A portion of Fred criokeburg is seen in the rear of the attacking forces, and beyond is the range of heights on the opposite aide of the river from which the Northerners have heavy guns playing on Merys's Hill to cover the sdvonce of their men. Numbers of their shell ore bursting over the Confederate soldiers in the breastwork. It was here General Cobb was killed, and it is his brigade acting as sharpshooters. At the back of this hill a South Carolinian had a portion of his heed carried away within four yards of myself by a shell from the heights alluded to above. After the battle, I counted (160 dead lying on a small plot of ground, scarcely four cores in extent, at the foot of the hill shown in the Illustration; and, alto-

 fth 1493 were buried between the hill and the town. Eight aiflderre'd were buried on that pat of the field occupied by Franklin. These were all Federals. This makes the Northern dead on the right end left amount to 2293. The Felerels, besides this, buried many within their own lines on the night of the battle."

The Southern correspondent of the Timre in his letter from Richmond, written shortly after the battle of I'hedcriokeburg, has some remarks on the important post at Maryo'e Hill, and of the dreadful slaughter of the assaulting troops, to whose bravery he bears no niggard testimony. Ho says -"Dy far the most important position was occupied by the Washington artillery, commanded by Colonel Wslton, of New Orleans, and posted on the heights in tho immediate neighbourhood of Froderiokeburg, not more than 400 yards from the town. These heights, which are precisely of that altitude which is most favourable for the play of artillery, are surmounted by a brick house, now riddled by round shot, belonging to Mr. Marye, and are commonly called Marye's Heights, At their base a road winds, protected on one side by the lime end on the other by a solid steno wall, about four feet m height, over which a brigade of Confederates, themselves perfectly sheltered, poured the deadliest and most effective of fires . . . . The battle wliichhad dashed furiously against the lines of Generals Hood, A. F. Hill, and Early, was little more than child'splay as compared with the onslaught directed by the Federole in the iinmediate neighbourhood of Frsdsricksburg. The impression that the Confederate batteries would not fire heavily upon the Federals advancing in this quarter, for fear of injuring the town of Frcderiekehurg, is believed to have prevailed among the Northern Generals. How bitterly they deceived themselves subsequent events served to show. To the Irish division, commanded by General Meagher, was principally oomzmtted the desperate task of bursting out of the town of Fredeosolcshurg and forming under the withering firs of the Cmfederate batteries, to attack iderys's Heights, lowering immediately m their front. Never at Fonteney, at Alhnera, or at Waterloo was more undoubted courage displayed by the eons of Em than during those six frantic dashes which they directed against the almost impregnable position of their fee. That any mcrtsl men could have carried the position before which they were wantonly ascrifloed defended as it was, it seems to me idle for a moment to believe; bce the bodies wluoh he in dense manes within forty yards of them uzzles of Colonel Walton'e guns are the best evidence what manner of men they were who pressed on to death with the dauntlessness of a race which lies gamed glory on a thousand battle-fields, and never more richly deserved it than at the fort of lsfsrye's Heights an the 13th day of December, 1862."

The same correspondent, in a subsequent letter written on Dec. 20,

thus returns to the subject of the lose of life resulting from the attack

on Murys's Hill:-"A glance at the long slope between the town of Fredercckshurg and the foot of Msrye's Heights gave the best idea of the magnitude of the tell which had been exacted for the Federals' passage of the Bappshanneak. A ride along the whole length of the lines told also a sad tale of slaughter; but when the eye had once rested upon the fatal slope above mentioned the memory became fried upon the spot, not for fifty-years to come will that scene ever fade from the memory of those who saw it. There, in every attitude of death, lying so close to each other that you might step from body to body, lay acres of the Fedsi.ol deed. It seemed that moat of the faces which lay nearest to Colonel Walton's artillery were of the.well-known Ittilesuan type. In one small garden, net more than half an acre in sire, there were 151 corpses. I doubt whether in any battle-field of modern times the dead have ever loin so thick and close. Dy universal consent of those who have seen all the great bottles of this war nothing like it has ever been seen before."
General Tom Thumb is about, for the tenth time, if pulls are to be believed, to be married. Mr. Barnum has announced to the public of New York that the future bride of the famous honnincdsos is Miss Lainia Warren, twenty-one inches high, and gran¥lthmghtor of General Warren, who was killed at the battle of Bunker's Bill! As the diminutive couple can in future only be exhibited to "the crowned heads of Europe," the beneficent Barnum efface the New Yorkers a final opportunity of attending the General's levdee at the American Museum, and at the small charge of twenty-dye cents a head

WBATLVEIe light may be thrown upon the foreign relations of

America by the debates which have recommenced at Westminster, it is certain that the state of the war and the domestic politics of the so-called Union are involved in a hare which at once obscures and distorts the objects it envelops. At this moment the American journals which are supposed to have the best means of procuring information can tell us neither what is being done nor what is wished. It is true that each of the leading papers-cteci cajco-is in a manner wedded to a party. When such is the care in England, and when such used to be the ease in France, the utterances of party orgaun were at least frank and intelligible, let them be worth what they might as exponents of truth. But even the party .organs in Fecleralin seem afraid of the crisis, of one another, :and of themselves, and anything more helplessly selfcontradictory than the united evidence of the American press upon the present condition of affairs can hardly be conceived. There seems only one point upon which they are agreed, although they express their conviction, of course, with more or less reticence, and that is, that the President of the North is a mistake. A ccrtain amount of credit is given to him for being

¥a well-meaning man, but such saving clauses are always fol

lowed by an array of proof that all his well-meanings lead to

bad ends. The Democrats are naturally the most unsparing in their strictures on Mr. Lincoln. They do not actually invite bins to lay down his authority and subside into the country, :attorney, but they endeavour to impress upon the public -that, unless he does pretty much the same thing-namely, abandons all his plans and all his Cabinet-the nation will be ruined. The Abolitionists are bound to praise his proclamation ; but they regard it as a Znatsene fse2-rnaa until the war shall be carried on in a way which they evidently -consider him unable to point out, or even superintend; and, indeed, the 24-i bune seems inclined to give up the game, and proposes that the North shall "bow to malignant fate "if another three months' sharp fighting (again ninety days) shall not have suppreFsed the Confederates.

We do not yet hear how the Imperial Message recommending a conference has been received. But his Majesty's declaration that he proposes to stop the undue extension of Anglo-Saxon dominion in America has given great offence, although circumstances will scarcely permit the Federals to display the anger they feel. We do not attach much weight to a demonstration which has been made on the subject in Congress. It is not to be expected that the North will fly in the face of their former idol and compel him to a recognition for which they believe him to be only too ready. The celebrated Mexican despatch does not come formally under the notice of Mr. Seward, and he will hardly volunteer to take it up; and he may urge that it concerns the South even more than the North. We sh1 be surprised if this despatch, which

in other days would have been answered by a riotous demon-stration of defiance, will prevent Mr. Seward from returning a very polite answer to the conference proposal. We may also risk the expression of our belief that unless that answer be a direct acceptance of the scheme-an event hardly within probability-it will not very much disturb the present plan of

the Emperor of the French. - - - -
It is generally believed that the army of the Potomac, under Burnside, is once more to be launched against the Confederates. We have heard of marchings and countermatchings, bet we finally read an almost piteous appeal from the Commander-in- Chief urging his soldiery to do sothething for the honour of the Union. It is scarcely fair to put the matter in this way, and, unless we are misinformed, the army itself sees the unfairness, as well as something else, which it does not hesitate to talk about. The Federals have gone to the slaighter *ith &orage that makes it shocking to see hew badly they axe hnd1ed by their leaders. Such men under a Wellington or a Clyde would have had another story to tell than one of incessant disaster and defeat. And the courage of the poor foolish hirelings, especially the Irish, who dashed themselves almost upon the guns that blew them away, is undeniable. But the army an have no confidence in such leadership as it has hitherto had, end without confidence in its chiefs an army is a mob. If it be tree that the soldiers of the Potomac are once more to be brought up to the defences of the Confederates, instead of being led in a way that offers reasonable hope of success, we see not hew such wanton waste of life is to be justified in the face of civilisation.

Meantime we are told that the North is really advancing to victory, for, though defeated in every pitched battle save one, the result of which was only lass disastrous than defeat, it is forcing its way in upon the Confederate territory at various
points other than in Virginia, and that its attacks are tailing upon the resources of the enemy. It is easy to say this, and it may be consolatory to those who are prompt to accept such assurances. But where is the proof? Doubtless New Orleans is in the hands of the Federals (who have done some good there, by-the-way, in compensation for much evil); but the possession of the Crescent City has rather relieved the South of a troublesome and dangerous post than injured the cause of the Confederates. And we know not what else there is to point at as a triumph. On the river the Foderals have notoriously failed, and it is thought that the latest failure is still being kept back from the knowledge of the public' But were twenty "points" made, the sole use of such occupation is to serve as a basis for operations, and it is mere child's play to talk of gain when such gain amounts to nothing but the holding an isolated spot, whence no practical movement can he made. We in England have had, unhappily, too much acquaintance with the real meaning of war to be deceived by the nonsense which passes muster among those who are profoundly ignorant of the true objects and nature of warfare, though they are singularly prompt at picking up its technicalities. We judge dispassionately, and we are unable to perceive that the war is really making any progress at all, or that the vaunted successes are more than a series of tentatives, more resembling exploration than military achievement. Furthermore, at the risk of offence, we must say that we believe the American public to be hopelessly is. the dark as to the campaign; end that, if it were possible for their vanity to study the strife through the English newspapers, there would coon be a demonstration of a very different kind from that of any which has yet been reported. Yes, we say it frankly- but without the least intention of wounding sensitive Americans-the fact is, that the boasted press of the North has proved hollow and rotten in the hour of trial, and when the English press best vindicates its claims to the respect end confidence of the people. The Americans have been content with "smart S' journals, and the cad of all is that the Union is left at the mercy of ignorance and of dishonesty. May a better

¥state of things arise out of the present dismal chaos
