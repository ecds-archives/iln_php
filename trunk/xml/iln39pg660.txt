<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER 28, 1861.</hi>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> a few days from the time of our publication England will, in all probability, bemade aware of the intentions of the American Government. If Mr. Lincoln has the courage to act up to his own convictions, and to defy the menaces of an infuriated mob, Messrs. Mason and Slidell are by this time on their way to our shores. But we have no great hope that such will be the freight of the vessel now hastening to Liverpool. It is true that ultimately the Government that shall provoke a contest with England will go down in disgrace when the ignorant and angry myriads who now denounce us are excited to frenzy by the chastisement which, in the event of war, England will inflict. It is true that, in the presence of disasters, no American Government, save that of military despotism, will be able to endure; and therefore that it is a choice of evils which the Lincoln Cabinet has before it. But with a certain class of minds the immediate danger is always more terrible than the remote one, and these are the chances for Messrs. Lincoln and Seward to reckon upon-the possible capital to be made out of a great success by General M'Clellan, and the possible interposition of European Powers between England and the Northern States. Of two evils choose the most distant, is a favourite variation upon a well-known rule; and we are disposed to believe that Mr. Lincoln will prefer to hear the distant cannon of Britain rather than the yell of a mob under the windows of the White house. Therefore we do not look for a message of peace, though we hope for it, so far as hope is consistent with a calm examination of the case.</p>

<p>At the same time we are glad to believe that the French notification will have its weight with the American Government. Nothing can be more distinct than this document, and it points out so lucidly to Mr. Lincoln that Captain Wilks has committed an outrage, that the reasoning must be convincing, whatever the resolutions of the President may be. There can be no doubt of the valuable character of this State paper, inasmuch as it testifies to the European world that the first of the Continental Powers takes the side of England. It may also have the advantage of inducing Mr. Lincoln to reconsider his position and to devise some means of extricating himself from it without the fatal appeal. We speak, of course, of the document, not as if it had been composed at the period at which it was issued, but as the embodiment of a decision which was doubtless perfectly well known to our Foreign Minister when he sent the despatch to America. We cannot suppose that diplomatists acting in concert, as those of France and England are understood to do tarried for the issue of a formal despatch. They must have been in perfect accord at the time the demand of England left these shores; and the President was at once made aware that though England desires no physical aid in any contest into which she may be called to enter, she has, and is glad to have, the moral support of the Imperial Government. We can only say again that we wish to believe Mr. Lincoln strong enough to listen to reason and justice.</p>

<p rend="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The Tower has lately been the scene of great bustle, owing to the preparations for sending military stores to Canada. Night and day, on Sundays as well as other days, men have been engaged packing arms, clothing, and other necessaries to a great amount, which are placed on sailing-barges moored alongside the quays; the stores are taken thence down the river, and shipped on board the transports now off Deptford and Woolwich.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday week a great number of persons assembled at an early hour at the Wellington Barracks, St. James's Park, on the occasion of the departure of the 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards and of the 2nd battalion of the Fusilier Guards for Canada. The 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards, 800 strong, under the command of Colonel the Hon. Hugh Manvers Percy, C.B. (Victoria Cross), assembled, shortly after six o'clock, on the parade at the Wellington Barracks, preparatory to their departure for Southampton. After a due inspection, and after partaking of breakfast, at half-past seven o'clock the battalion left for the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. Owing to the death of the Prince Consort the regimental baud did not accompany the battalion to the station. On their arrival at the terminus the men were told off in fours, and with the greatest facility--the system having been initiated by the late General Torrens-the train started at eight o'clock with its gallant burden; so that the entire battalion, each man carrying his rifle and a cooked ration, left quarters and started by railway to their destinations within half an hour. The men were loudly cheered as they proceeded to the railway. The 2nd battalion of the Scots Fusilier, of the same strength, commanded by Colonel William John Ridley, left the Wellington Barracks at eight o'clock, and pursued the same route--along Birdcage-walk. Great George-street, and across Westminster-bridge. The same excellent arrangements were observed, and without slightest confusion or delay the battalion departed at half-past eight o'clock for its destination. As the detatchments reached the docks on arriving at Southampton, they were received by the Southampton Volunteer Rifle Corps, and escorted to their respective ships by the band. The troops were cheered as they left the docks an immense crowd of persons.</p>

<p>The steamer Adriatic, with the Grenadier Guards, and the Parana, with the Scots Fusilier Guards and the eighteenth company of the Royal Engineers, left the docks about two o'clock in the afternoon and anchored in the river. Both vessels sailed for their destination early on the following morning.The Parana had a berth in the docks close to the Nashville, the Confederate man-of-war. As she was leaving her berth, with the Guards on board, the band struck up the tune, "I'm off to Charleston so early in the morning," The officers of the Nashville were watching the departure of the Parana with apparently considerable interest.</p>

THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT AND THE OUTRAGE 
ON THE TRENT.

M. Thouvenel, the French Minister of Foreign Aflairo, han addressed

the following highly important despatch to the representative of France

at Washington

TILE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO TII FRENCH MINISTER AT

WASHINGTON.

Paris, Dec. 3, 1861.

arOlssieut,-The arrest of MM. Mason and Slidell on hoard the English packet Trent by all American cruiser has produced in Future, if not the -ama emotion in England, at least great astvnishmciit and an extreme r~nsation.

Public opinion at once inquired. wills anxiety for the consequences, whet her such a,. act could possibly he legitimate, and there cannot ho the slightest doubt of the general Impression. The act secm.s to the public so entirely at variance with the ordinary rules of international lass' that it throws the responsibility exclinively upon the commander of the San ,Tacinto.

We cannot know yet whether thi supposition is well founded. And the Emperors Government has therefore felt called upon to consider the question raised by the capture of the two paoocugers on board the Trout. The desire to contribute to prevent a conflict, which Is perhaps imminent, between two Powers towards whom it Is .uviinate,l by equally friendly aeu.timente, and the duty of mahitaining-with. a view to putt the rights of its own hag beyond the dsuger of attack-certain principles essential ta the security of neutrals, have, after mature reflection convinced the French Government that it cannot remain completely silent unier existing circumstances.

It, to our great regret, the Washington Cabinet should be disposed to approve the conduct of the commander of the San Jacinto, they must consider MM. Shilell and Mason either so c,,elnies or as rot,cle. I., either en5e there would be an extremely regretabis forgetfulness of principle, on which we have shreys found the Vnited States agreed with Its.

 On what ground, in the first suppo'ed ease, can the Aunericen cruiser have arrested MM. Mason and Slislell ? The United States have a.tn,ittod, with us, in treatise concluded between the two coit,,tri,'s, that the froestoin of the hag extends to persona found on board, MIL though, they he e,telnieo, except in the case of military men actually in the service of the enemy. MItt. Mason and

SI out 1

lidell %% ere, therefore, b3 virtue of this principle, which we have never f it oar difficulty fit getting Inserted in our trestles of friendship and commerce, perfectly free under the netutriti flag of England.

It will not, douh.tleso, be pretentinil that they could be considered as contraband of war. What constitutes contraband of war is not, it is true. precisely settled the limits are not aluohutely the same for all Powers but, es far as regards persons, the stipulations found in treaties relative to military persons clearly define the character of the individuals who alone are lisbie La be captured by belligerents.

Now, it cannot be necessary todemonotrate that MM. Mason and Shl.Iell can in no way be assimilated to persons in this category. There would, therefore, remain no ground to explain their erptnre but the pretext that they were bearers of ofilcial .lesjsatches from the enemy. But this is the place to call to mind a circumstance which overrides the whole case, and allows the conduct of the American cruiser to have ))Poll tinjnstttiable.

The Trout was not bound to it point belonging to either of the belligerents. It was carrying its cargo nod passengers to a neutral country and, moreover, it was at a neutral port that it had takeit the,n "l'¥ If it were a.lmissil,is these, under such circumstances, the neutral flag did ttot co,upietely cot-er the persons and goods transported n,,der it, the humanity of that hag scoutti be a vat., word the commerce and navigation of third Powers would be liable to suffer at any moment for their innocent, or even indirect, relations with either of the belligerents. The latter would not only have a right to require flout the neutral the most complete itnpartiolity, and to interdict him Icusi being mixed up in any way with acts of host ihity, but they would inflict restrictions upon the liberty of commerce and navigation which modern lntrrnntional law ref uses to acknowledge as legitimate. There would be a return, in a word, to those vexatious practices against i% ]rich, us former times, no Power I'm-

 tested more energetically than the United Stoles.

If thin Washington Cabinet should regard this two persons arrested as rel,eis,

ss-t.o,,t it has always a rig] it to seize, ti,- quest ion, though shifting its round could not be m,soro i-cash-ed its a sense f.,vourable to the commander of this Suit I Jacinta. In such a case there would be a contempt of the principle i,, virtue of which a ship is held to be a portion of the territory whose flag it beams, and there would be a violation of time immunity srh,ich, forbids a foreign Sovereign to exercise jurisdiction out that territory. It cannot doubtless be necessary to call to mind the energy with which, the United States has, oil every ocessio,o, defended this iu..munity and the right of Asylum whirl, is a consequence of it.

Without wishing to enter upon a more thorough hiocuosiom, of the qua's ti.ma raised by the capture of MM. Mason and Shidehi, I have said enough, t think, to show that the Cabinet of Washington cannot, wittouut infringing tl,ose principles which all neutral Powers are alike interested in maintaining, user without putting Itself in contradiction with. its own conduct up to t lie. he,ct time, give its approbation of the conduct of the Sat, Jerinto. In this state of things thus Cabinet of Washington cannot, in our opinion, hesitate as to the course to be taken.  -

Lord Lyons Is already charged to present this demand for satisfaction whilst, thin English. Cabinet is under the nrcseeity of snaking, and which cutusots in the Inisnejiate release of the persons taken from the Trent, and cxi,lao,ihhOmtS which, shall relieve the act of the Captain of the San Jacints of its ehhrusiVe character to the British flag. This Federal Government would be Inspired by a just and elevated sentiment in yielding to these demands. It is luu,1sce'hbla to conceive any object or any interest that it could have to nun time dolt of provoking a rupture with Great Britain by Assuming a different attitude.

For ourselves, who would see in, such a rupture a complication is, every oray deplorable of the difficulties with, which the Cabinet of Washington hiss already to struggle, and a proceeding calculated to occasion serious uneasiness to all the Powers not parties to the present conflict, we think we are giving a testinuony of loyal friendship to the Cabinet of Washington fit not concealing front it our opinion.  -

I request you. Sir, to 'take this first opportunity of speaking frankly with Mr. Seward, and, if he should desire it, to leave him a copy of this despatch.Receive, &c.,  TuOtVhiasEL.

We state for the satisfaction of the relatives and friends of the

troops leaving for Canada that the ' Persia, and time other large steamers,

carry es,1h four boats fitted with Clifford's patent for Instantly and safety

lowering-them.
