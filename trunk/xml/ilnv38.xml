               </p>
               <p>The resignation of
Mr. Cobb has been followed by that of General Cass, Secretary of
State, apparently from opposite reasons.  General Cass resigned, it is
stated, because the President declined to send more troops to
Charleston.  Mr. Trescott, the Assistant Secretary of State, has
likewise resigned.  The manifesto which declares that a southern
confederacy is now alone possible is signed by representatives of
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana&#x2014;a
circumstance which, in itself, is a sufficient evidence of the
formidable character of the secession movement.  The special Committee
of the House has, it is said, passed resolutions in favour of giving
further guarantees to the South that her "peculiar institution" will
be respected.  In the House itself resolutions upon resolutions are
being piled up, but none are adopted, and the divisions of opinion
which exist are apparently hopeless.  A resolution had been passed in
the Senate providing for the appointment of a Select Commitee [sic] of
thirteen to report on the state of the Union.  Many of the southern
members of Congress had signed a manifesto declaring that the day of
compromise had passed, and that secession was inevitable.</p>
               <p>Mr.
Buchanan had appointed the 4th of January as a day of national
humiliation and prayer.</p>
               <p>The Louisiana Legislature has passed a
bill providing for the election of delegates to a convention of the
Southern States, and has voted a sum of 500,000 dollars for the
purpose of arming the State militia; and the Legislature of South
Carolina has taken steps for providing two war-steamers.  The Senate
of North Carolina had passed a bill for arming the State.  The members
of the South Carolina Convention were received at Charleston on the
18th ult. with military honours.  The Convention had appointed a
committee to prepare an address to the people of the Northern
States.</p>
               <p>In the meantime, it is cheering to read that Kansas is
to be admitted as a free State, and that the Nebraska Legislature has
prohibited slavery in that territory.</p>

               </p>
               <p>. . . From America the news is
far from satisfactory to those who would see with regret the mighty
Union severed by a black wedge.  The secessionists are making such
large use of the argument derived from the belief that the South would
obtain grand commercial advantages by a separation that adhesions of a
very significant character are coming in to the side of the
dis-unionists.  The President's Message has not produced a healing
effect, and he had set apart a day for solemn humiliation and prayer,
an observance he had fixed for the 4th of the present month.  It would
be difficult for one of our own hierarchy to frame such a form of
petition as would be generally satisfactory under the circumstances,
but perhaps the American divines may be more successful, unless,
indeed, the matter and manner of the prayers be left to individual
sentiment.  Mr. Buchanan is, as might have been expected, much
assailed; and in some of the articles against him there is a rancour
of imputation which must be offensive to the good taste of the
educated portion of the Republic.  We Englishmen may still be
permitted to hope that the work of George Washington will not be
destroyed&#x2014;that the double agency which is being brought to bear&#x2014;the
hydraulic press of political hate, and the steam-tug of commercial
aspiration (to borrow a metaphor from our launch)&#x2014;may not be potent
enough to tear the Republic in twain.  Farsighted American statesmen
have left on record their conviction that such a crisis would one day
arrive, but the existing race will show themselves less worthy of
their noble predecessors than they would willingly be esteemed if they
are unequal to the task of averting the disaster against which they
had been warned.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">There</hi> never was a nation so calculated to solve a number
of difficult political problems as that which we have hitherto known
as the United States of America.  Descended as the people of that
country are from a nation which has wrought the greatest civil liberty
out of a mass of anomalies, and which has sent along with its
colonisation the germ of independent life and the principles of
self-action, they have, from many local circumstances, apart from the
fair start, all the advantages of  <pb n="26"/> which they possessed,
the widest scope for the perfecting of a system of political freedom.
At a distance from Europe and all her intricate questions and
diplomatic influences, yet blessed to the utmost with her
civilisation, and imbued with the Anglo-Saxon temperament, if the
Americans are not made for a Government in which the sway of law and
good sense alone are acknowledged, what nation is or ever was so?  And
yet at this moment we behold the painful spectacle of the positive
disruption of the Federal Union, and the absolute prospect of civil
war in that country.  The fact of the formal secession of South
Carolina from the federation of the States, and the withdrawal of her
legislative members from Congress, have, as nearly as possible,
brought the vexed question of the dissolution of North and South to an
issue.  This step will probably be imitated by others of the
slave-holding States, and the threatened scheme of a separate and
independent empire may possibly be carried into execution.  The
discussion of that subject in the South had taken a very decided turn
before any action was determined upon; and we believe that there have
been some persons who have not hesitated to argue that the genius of
the people of the South and the nature of their institutions are more
in consonance with a Constitutional Monarchy than with a Republic.
While it is not very flattering to the only Monarchical Government to
which allusion can be meant to argue that its spirit and surroundings
are adapted to a system which has the maintenance of slavery for is
first principle, it is clear that such an idea may be at once
dismissed as a mere chimera.  Monarchy in those regions, if it exist
at all, could only be of the nature of a military despotism.  It is,
however, early yet to speculate on the form of government which would
be adopted in the South if final and complete secession from the North
should take place.  The question&#x2014;and a very interesting one it is to
us in England for more reasons than one&#x2014;is the probability, for the
matter has gone beyond possibility, of such an occurrence.</p>
               <p>We
trust we may be forgiven if, in considering this matter, we venture to
hint in the outset that something must be allowed for the peculiarity
of the American temperament in reference to politics.  The eagerness
with which the citizens of the United States are accustomed to throw
themselves into the political arena has always seemed to us to have
sprung as much from a desire for the excitement of the movement as
from a serious effort to vindicate and establish a principle.  To what
lengths this tendency might not carry them it is not easy to say.  The
struggle for victory may be extended even to such a calamity as the
severance of the two sections of the Union.  It is earnestly to be
hoped that such a thing will not really come to pass.  No doubt the
triumphant attitude of the North, consequent upon the recent
Presidential election, may have caused the hot blood of the South to
kindle into a ferment, and the proverbial strife of alienated brethren
may be imminent.  But may it not be suggested that the Southerns have
laid too much stress on the election of Mr. Lincoln to the Presidency?
and may they not have confounded the angry sensations attendant on a
political defeat in his person into a political and social revolution,
the advent of which the circumstances do not seem to us by any means
to warrant?  The Slave States appear to assume that a positive crusade
against "the domestic institution" is, with a view to its ultimate
extinction, about to commence.  As far as we have been able to
understand the situation consequent on the choice of Mr. Lincoln to
fill the Presidential chair, the policy which he proposes to
inaugurate is not necessarily aggressive.  No one supposes, at least
those who are calm lookers-on do not, that an attempt is about to be
made to abolish slavery altogether in America. Unhappily, we fear that
such a consummation is still far distant.  All that is probably
intended is to give every moral discouragement to the increase of
slavery, and to pave the way for some safe, gradual, but somewhat
remote removal of such an anomaly from the midst of the nation which
boasts to be the freest in the world.  Precipitation and rashness in
such a matter would be inimical in a party and treasonable in a
Government.  We doubt if the most advanced Abolitionist in the States
means, far less hopes for, any such thing.  Be that as it may, one
thing is certain, and that is, that a practical difficulty has already
arisen which will tax all the patriotism and all the good sense of the
citizens of the great Republic to meet and to solve.  A very serious
responsibility has been cast on the Federal Executive. It is asserted
by the extreme section of the party which has carried Mr. Lincoln's
election that the act of the South Carolinians is simply treason, and
must be put down by force of arms&#x2014;that is to say, that in this
nineteenth century the most practical people upon earth are to enter
on a contest like that which distinguished the middle ages of English
history, and men of the same country and of the same race are to
slaughter each other, and to peril the very existence of a great
commercial community by the horrors of a civil war.  At any rate, this
does not seem to be Mr. Buchanan's policy.  It appears that he has
resolved that during the short period that he remains in power no
military opposition shall be made to the movement in South Carolina;
and by his orders the troops stationed in the neighbourhood of
Charleston are to give way before any attack made on the forts they
occupy.  Always assuming the truth of the assertion of the Northern
party, that in such a case the President is, by the law of the United
States, bound to resist an act of secession, no doubt this is only
another mark of the feebleness and vacillation which have
characterised Mr. Buchanan's Presidential career.  At the same time,
there is every excuse to be made for an executive officer whose term
of power is <hi rend="italic">in extremis</hi>, and especially in America.  There would,
probably, be little desire on the part of the retiring President to do
much to lessen the difficulties of a successor his rivality with whom
is essentially one of principle.  We are told, however, that the duty
of Mr. Lincoln "is pronounced in the Constitution of the country, and
that he will perform that duty: disunion with armed force is treason,
and must and will be put down at all hazards."  But what hazards? Have
those who use this language contemplated its extent and meaning? Do
they seriously suppose that, although there may be a discordant and
disturbing element in the materials out of which such a State as that
of the American Republic has been constructed, disruption and ultimate
division can take place and leave either section unscathed?  The
United States occupy a very imposing and very suggestive position in
the eyes of the world: what will be the amount of consideration which
will be bestowed on the disunited States?  In truth, we cannot help
shrinking from the contemplation of the direful evils which await an
internecine collision, such as many are inclined to believe to be
imminent.  Of the inner and more domestic effects of such a calamity
it is scarcely necessary to attempt a portrayal.  The matter speaks
for itself.  As regards the broad national question, it is painful,
indeed, to predicate the possibility of the establishment of two
comparatively feeble Commonwealths, standing apart and hostile on that
grand platform which the great American continent has afforded to men
of the same blood for the purpose first of creating and then of
consolidating an empire which, with all the vigour and impetuosity of
youth, has shown the persistent forward purpose of assured manhood,
which in a few years has almost given the go-by in the race of
progress to the panting civilisation of the Old-World nations, and to
which, as we believe, has been committed a great trust for the future
of mankind.</p>
               <p>Surely it is not too much to hope that such a
nation will, as a whole, ere it be too late, yield to the influences
of common sense and common prudence, and that the two great parties in
the States will see the wisdom of a policy of mutual combination and
mutual forbearance.  It would be paying our cousins a very bad
compliment to suppose that out of the difficulties and complications
in which they are now involved will ensue mere anarchy and political
and governmental chaos.  But it is certain that if this matter goes on
to the point which it is quite possible for it to reach, and that
soon, confusion, disorganisation, and disorder must prevail, to the
vast social injury of every inhabitant of the country, and to the very
certain deterioration of the moral and political influence of the
States in the comity of nations.  We sincerely believe that with
patience and the exercise of discretion that which we hold to be a
moral blot on the character of America as a free Republic may be
removed without danger to the State, and without direct injustice to
individuals.  One thing is quite certain, that it will not be
instantaneously eradicated by the action of the sword, and, in the
interests of all that belongs to humanity and to the social well-being
of millions of a great race planted in a great country, we trust that
recourse will not be had to that sharp remedy.</p>

                  The Secession of South Carolina</p>
               <p>The
long-threatened blow has fallen&#x2014;South Carolina, the chief of the
Southern States, has seceded from the great American Federation.  At
the Convention sitting at Charleston the 109 delegates unanimously<pb n="27"/>
 resolved, on the 20th of December last, to dissolve the
union between South Carolina and the other States.  The formal act was
voted in the following terms:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>An Ordnance to Dissolve the
Union between the State of South Carolina and other States united with
her under the Compact entitled the Constitution of the United States
of America.</p>
               <p>We, the people of the State of South Carolina, in
Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is declared and
ordained, that the ordnance adopted by us in Convention on the 23rd
day of May, in the year of our Lord 1788, whereby the Constitution of
the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts
of Acts of the General Assembly of this State ratifying amendments of
the said Constitution, are hereby repealed; and that the union now
subsisting between South Carolina and other States, under the name of
the United States of America, is hereby dissolved.</p>
               <p>The
Legislature has approved the vote, and has taken measures for its
formal communication to the Government at Washington.  The members
from South Carolina announced to the House of Representatives that
they had ceased to belong to the House, as their State had seceded
from the Union, but the Speaker ordered their names to be retained on
the roll.  The South Carolina Legislature invited the slaveholding
States to follow the example which it has set to them.</p>
               <p>The
decree of secession of South Carolina from the Union had been followed
up by Fort Moultrie, Castle Pinackney [sic], the Custom House, Post
Office, and Arsenal being occupied by the State troops.</p>
               <p>Some
important discussions have since taken place in the Legislature of
South Carolina with regard to the appropriation of Federal property in
the State, the arrangements of the Post Office, and the collection of
the customs duties.  Various propositions were made&#x2014;none of them
differing materially in principle.  One authorised the Governor to
make temporary regulations; another proposed to abolish the existing
duties as far as the other Slave States were concerned, but to retain
them in all other cases; and a third proposition had for its object
the reduction of the duties to half their present rates. </p>
               <p>The
secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union will no doubt be
speedily followed by that of other Slave States; indeed, Florida,
Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Georgia, and Louisiana have already
sounded the tocsin, and will soon meet in convention for the purpose
of deciding on the question of secession.  The news of the secession
of South Carolina was received with exultation at Norfolk, Richmond,
Mobile, New Orleans, and other places in the slaveholding
interest.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, the North men assert that, though
individual States may practically stop their Government, though their
Federal officers may resign, and though they may close their courts
and public offices, they cannot withdraw from the Union; that to do so
is treason to the Federal Government; and the organ of the future
President intimates pretty plainly that if South Carolina (and of
course any other seceding State) interferes with the action of the
Federal Government, by obstructing the collection of revenues at her
ports or otherwise, the Government will enforce the law&#x2014;which means
that the North will by force compel, or try to compel, the seceding
States to give way and return to the Union.  "Disunion (says the
<hi rend="italic">Springfield Journal</hi>, understood to be Mr. Lincoln's organ) by armed
force is treason, and treason must and will be put down at all
hazards."</p>
               <p>Mr. Seward, who, notwithstanding the election of
Mr. Lincoln, may still be regarded as the virtual leader of the
Republican party, has delivered a speech at New York on the Disunion
question.  He spoke in a very conciliatory tone, as if anxious to pour
oil upon the troubled sea of Southern politics, and expressed his
belief that the Disunion movement was losing strength.  He appears to
have taken&#x2014;perhaps designedly&#x2014;a more hopeful view of the prospects
of the Union than the real state of affairs actually justified.</p>
               <p>The Republican party are evidently determined to agree to no
compromise which will involve a surrender on their part of the
principles laid down in the Chicago Convention.  The propositions
submitted by Mr. Crittenden to the Senate Committee of Thirteen for
the pacification of the country have been rejected by seven to
five&#x2014;the Republicans voting unanimously against it. Mr. Crittenden's
scheme involved the legalisation of slavery south of 36 deg. 30 min.
of latitude, the abrogation of ths [sic] right of Congress to abolish
the inter-state slave trade, and the exaction of an indemnity from the
Free States for those fugitive slaves whose reclamation might be
prevented by the Personal Liberty Acts or by rescue.  This was
regarded by the border Slave States as a most moderate proposal!</p>
               <milestone unit="section" rend="line"/>
               <p>The Pacific Railroad Bill passed the House of
Representatives on the 20th ult., after a considerable debate, by a
vote of ninety-five to seventy-four.  During the course of the debate
Mr. Garnett, of Virginia, announced his belief that Virginia would not
hold herself responsible for the debt to be incurred in the issue of
the necessary bonds for the construction of the road.</p>
               <p>A
gigantic fraud has been discovered in the Department of the Interior
at Washington, a South Carolinian named Bailey, having, as it is
alleged, contrived to embezzle nearly 1,000,000 dollars.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">HISTORY OF AMERICAN SLAVERY.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The New York correspondent of the <title>Times</title> supplies a
most useful and interesting history of slavery as a political question
in the United States.  The writer takes up the story from the meeting
of the Federal Convention at Philadelphia in May, 1787, and shows, by
quotations from the speeches of the founders of the Republic and from
the Acts of the Convention, that at the date of the formation of the
present Constitution slavery was regarded as an evil to be deplored,
and, if possible, to be got rid of.</p>
               <p>"The ascendancy of the
anti-slavery party continued through the Administrations of General
Washington and Mr. Adams.  The first retroactive move was the
annexation of Louisiana by Mr. Jefferson in 1802, which was regarded
as an unconstitutional act by the party which brought it about, and
was justified only by the obvious political necessity of securing the
western bank and outlet of the Mississippi. All comparative statements
of population are made by decennial periods in the United States.</p>
               <p>"Let us pause at the year 1810.  During the twenty years two new
Slave States and two new Free States had been added to the Union, and
the territorial dominion of the slave interest had also been extended
by the acquisition of Louisiana.  The white population of the country
had increased about 82 per cent, the slave population about 70 per
cent, and the free black population about 213 per cent.  This increase
in the free black population is attributable to the emancipation of
slaves in the North; notwithstanding this, it appears that the slave
population nearly held its own with the white, from which we infer
that the African slave trade supplied the gaps made by the Northern
emancipation.</p>
               <p>"Between 1810 and 1820 two new Slaves States
and three new Free States were admitted to the Union. The Southern
States, feeling themselves strong in numbers and wealth, then made the
first move towards legalising slavery in the newly-acquired territory.
 The contest about Missouri began in 1818, and lasted more than three
years.  The Lower House several times voted to exclude the institution
from the new State, and the Conservative Senate as often restored it.
The struggle ended by the adoption of the line of 36 deg. 30 min. as
the limit beyond which slavery should not go.  Under this law, known
as 'the Missouri Compromise,' the South and the North have each gained
two States.  During the same period a further Southern addition was
made in the purchase of Florida.</p>
               <p>"Of the fifteen Slave States
only nine are large producers of cotton.  The other six supply the
slaves to work the plantations of the South.  The increase of slaves
in the latter States, consequently, is not proportionate with the
increase in the former.  In the ten years ending in 1850, for
instance, the slave population of the United States increased 28 per
cent.  During the same period the slave population of Virginia
increased only 5 1/2 per cent, while in Mississippi it increased 57
per cent, and in Arkansas 135 per cent. This explains why the Northern
Slave States must politically support the planting States.  The
prohibition of the African slave trade gives them the monopoly of the
Southern slave markets.</p>
               <p>"The nine cotton States are divided
into three great natural sections.  South Carolina and the Atlantic
part of Georgia form the eastern, the oldest, and the least valuable
section.  The seashore and the islands which abound off the coast
produce the Sea Island cotton.  A wide track of pine barren and swamp
separates these from the uplands.  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas form
a district to the west of the Mississippi.  The soil of the former
State is principally given up to the production of sugar; in the
others the growth of cotton is recent, and confined to the country
(except Texas) having an outlet through the Mississippi.  The capacity
of this enormous country is almost boundless.  The lands are rich and
yield heavy crops.  They contain more than 350,000,000 acres, of which
less than 5,000,000 are improved, and are permeated by large navigable
rivers.  Alabama, Mississippi, the northern part of Florida, and the
southern part of Tennessee, constitute the third section, and furnish
more than one half of the entire production of the United States.  The
soll [sic] is varied but ever rich.  The dark loamed valleys among the
sandy uplands of the north, the prairies of the centre, and the
lowlands near the Mississippi, are all made to yield the great staple.
When the Missouri compromise was enacted, nearly the whole of this
rich country was in the occupation of the aborigines.  Now they are
all driven to the west of the Mississippi, and their lands are made to
minister to the wants of civilised man.</p>
               <p>"In 1830 we find one
more Slave State than in 1820&#x2014;Missouri.  The free emigration from New
York and Pennsylvania had also begun to go into Michigan, and the
slave emigration into Florida and Arkansas.  An unnoticed movement
towards Texas had also commenced.  Simultaneously with the passage of
the Missouri compromise, Mexico had emancipated its slaves, but Texas
was so far removed from the Central Government that the importation of
slaves from the neighbouring States could not be prevented.  In this
way slavery found an illegal footing there.  Its increase in the
American Republic at that time was greater than is indicated by the
number of new Slave States.  No federal measure had given it so rapid
an impulse as the removal of the Indians to the west of the
Mississippi. The population of Alabama increased 136 per cent between
1820 and 1830, and the south-western States were found, for the first
time, producing a larger crop than the Atlantic States.  Not only did
they have the advantage in quantity, but in the cost of production.
The same amount of labour expended on these fertile lands yielded an
average production of 2000lb. to the hand, while the older lands of
Carolina would hardly yield 900lb.  Thus the whole production of the
country, which in 1816 amounted to only 100,000,000lb., in 1831
reached 300,000,000lb.  Such was the demand for cotton that the price
was not materially reduced.  The average price for the ten years
(excluding the inflated year of 1825) was between 11c. and 12c., the
price before the crisis of this year.  The improvements in machinery
and competition in markets have cheapened manufactured goods without
reducing the price of the raw material.</p>
               <p>"During the next ten
years Arkansas was admitted as a Slave State and Michigan as a Free
State. The movement for the independence of Texas began about the same
time. Under the administration of Mr. Tyler steps were taken to annex
it to the United States, on the avowed ground that it was necessary to
prevent emancipation.  Its annexition [sic] was completed by Mr. Polk,
and brought on the Mexican war, in which General Taylor won the
laurels that made him Mr. Polk's successor.  By this annexation the
Union acquired a new Slave State, with the right to make four others
out of the territory as it should be peopled.  Iowa and Wisconsin were
both admitted as Free States about this time.  The annexation of Texas
was intended by its friends to balance any future increase of the
North in that quarter.  The treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo terminated
the Mexican war, by the cession of California and New Mexico to the
United States, and the struggle for their possession began at once. In
the Presidential election of 1848 a large part of the northern
democrats and Whigs seceded from their respective parties, and united
on the basis of non-extension of slavery, which they proposed to
effect by enacting Mr. Jefferson's proviso as the fundamental law of
the newly-acquired territory; and, though not strong enough to cast a
vote in the Electoral College, they succeeded in throwing the
Administration of General Taylor into a minority in Congress.  This
sectional party, known as the Free-soil Party, was organised in every
Northern State, and in the great State of New York threw a vote in
excess of that of the regular Democratic party.  The European
emigration also, commencing in 1846 for the first time on a great
scale, was beginning to add a visible strength to the free labour of
the North.  In spite of annexation, and in spite of slave
representation, the South found itself losing ground.  At the
formation of the Constitution it had 46 per cent of the Lower House;
in in [sic] 1810, 43 per cent; 41 per cent in 1830; and 39 per cent in
1850.  Free labour was gaining in spite of odds.  The administration
of General Taylor came into power under such a state of feeling, and
ended a stormy existence in sixteen months by the death of its chief.
Without being decidedly Northern, it certainly was not Southern.  The
Government plan for settling the sectional difficulties would have
made Free States of California and Mexico, thus stopping the extension
of slavery.  This was opposed by the united South and the Northern
Presidential rivals of General Taylor.  The successor of General
Taylor reversed his policy; the compromise measures of 1850 were
passed; General Pearce [sic] was elected to support them; and they
have since been naturally followed by the repeal of the Missouri
compromise, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the Dred Scott decision, and the
rebellion of 1860.  The North endeavoured to unite in 1856 to resist
these measures, but found themselves unable to do so.  Mr. Buchanan
was elected by the united vote of the South and of the great border
States of Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Illinois.  In 1860 the verdict is
reversed.  The great Democratic party has been itself divided.  A
portion, under the lead of Mr. Douglas, has maintained that Congress
has no authority to legislate for the territories, but that each
territory is sovereign within itself.  A portion, under the lead of
Mr. Breckenridge, has contended that by the Constitution the right is
guaranteed to every citizen of the United States to remove to any of
the territories with all his property that is recognised as property
in the State from which he goes.  The old Whig party has entirely
vanished from the Northern States, and the Republican party, having
the freedom of the territories as its leading idea, has elected its
President by a nearly unanimous vote of the Free States&#x2014;three votes
out of the seven votes of the State of New Jersey being the only one
[sic] cast against him.  The southern planting States are consequently
moving with unexampled unanimity for a dismemberment of the
Confederation, and there is now little doubt that, before the
expiration of Mr. Buchanan's term, the United States of Northern
America will, on paper at least, consist of several Slave States less
than at present.  Instead of the extinguishment of slavery as
predicted in 1787, it now threatens to extinguish the Federation.  It
exists in fifteen of the thirty-one States of the Union, sends thirty
senators to Congress and eighty-eight representatives, and has
controlled the Federal Government for the whole century.  All the
territories of the United States are open to its extension.  We have
marked its beginning and traced its progress.</p>
               <p>"We have seen
the cotton crop, less than a million of pounds in 1790, expand to
4,600,000 bails, of 400lb. in each, in 1859.  The conclusion is
irresistible that this plant&#x2014;which brings honest bread and cheap
clothing to so many free men and women, which yields millions of
wealth to Great Britain, and enables a reduction of taxation upon the
necessaries of life, which regulates exchanges between the greatest
commercial countries, which gives employment to more labour than any
other vegetable production&#x2014;has also perpetuated African bondage."</p>

               <p>. . . No case
has excited more interest than that of the American negro Anderson,
who, flying for freedom, slew the man who attempted to stop him, and,
escaping into Canada, is claimed by the authorities of his own State.
The majority of the Judges of the first tribunal to which the matter
has been referred decide that we are bound to give him up, but the
dissentient Judge, in an elaborate speech, took the opposite side, and
argued that neither legally nor morally could we be called upon to
surrender the man to be burned alive, as he will assuredly be, if
yielded up.  There is, of course, an appeal, and there will be
another, should the Canadian Court of Error not reverse the judgment
of the Court below, so that there will be ample opportunity for
discussing the case, in which not only is the question deeply
interesting as one of morals, but there is a very nice point of law
involved.  It is, however, felt that in some way or other a horrible
crime must be prevented.  For England to deliver over that poor man
(whose flying from slavery was a laudable action, and whose blow was
dealt only to save himself from being captured) to the tender mercies
of the now maddened slave-masters would be a blot which no amount of
anti-slavery speeches could ever efface.</p>

               <p>
                  THE SECESSION MOVEMENT IN AMERICA.
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">When</hi>,
immediately upon the announcement of the election of Mr. Lincoln to
the Presidency of the United States, South Carolina raised a cry for
secession from the Union, it was quietly assumed both by the free
States and by the great majority of well-informed politicians in
Europe that it had been resorted to only as a threat, and that no
serious intention could be entertained of carrying the threat into
execution.  The advantages of the Union to the Slaveholding States had
been so great, so palpable, and so uninterruptedly enjoyed for above
half a century&#x2014;the perils to be faced as the certain consequences of
disruption seemed so numerous and obvious&#x2014;and the occasion seized
upon as the ground of justification for so extreme a course appeared
to the rest of the world so utterly inadequate, that no sober-minded
man could regard the avowed purpose of the Southern States with any
other feeling than incredulity.  Nevertheless, as we have seen, South
Carolina has seceded.  Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida,
Louisiana, and Texas, have either followed her example or are on the
eve of doing so. The border States will probably be drawn into the
vortex of the revolution; and before Mr. Lincoln takes his place in
the Presidential chair the Republic seems likely to be rent in twain,
and two or more powerful and rival Confederacies to be substituted for
it.</p>
               <p>Even now political good sense finds it hard to believe in
the reality of the astounding result.  To say nothing of the glorious
historic page which is thereby torn to atoms, and the international
power and prestige which are at once surrendered, one cannot help
surmising that when the heat of passion has had time to cool down, the
mutual interests of the sundered parties will operate, like the
curative force of nature, to close the wound and reunite the
dissevered tissue.  Possibly "the wish is father to the thought;" that
the South is making use of disruption, not as an end to be rested in,
but as a means to an end; but, assuredly, the thought underlies the
speculations of most men with regard to the future of the Empire
Republic.   It is imagined that as soon as a Southern confederacy is
constituted negotiations with the North will be opened through the
mediation of the democratic Free States and the border Slave States;
that terms of compromise will be found, and that a readjustment of the
Union will be effected.  That the current of feeling in America is
gradually setting in towards this point, the direction in which the
straws upon the surface are drifting seems to indicate.  Appearances,
however, which have been deceptive before, may again deceive; and the
history of nations teams with proofs that when once they have
overstepped the bounds of reason, albeit with the purpose of returning
when their ends shall have been accomplished, the very events which
their own passion has produced frequently raise a barrier against
their retreat, and  <hi rend="italic">nulla vestigia retrorsum</hi>
becomes their doom.</p>
               <p>We are not sure that the eager haste of
South Carolina to slip from within the bonds of the Union is due
exclusively to the wrongs she professes to have suffered.  Doubtless,
the "peculiar domestic institution" is sacred in her eyes, and perhaps
she believes, and may have some reason for believing, that the late
Presidential election has cast an ominous shadow on the perpetuity of
slavery.  But something more than fear and indignation are needed to
account for the precipitancy with which she has detached herself from
the Union.  Mr. Lincoln's election was not more threatening to her
than to other Slave States; nor, supposing his policy to be what has
been ascribed to him by Southern demagogues, would she have been the
first to feel the injury.  But South Carolina is a seaboard State,
possessing ports capable of being raised to first-rate importance.  A
Southern Confederacy, trading direct with England, and released from
the restrictions of protective import duties, would export through
Charleston the whole produce of the Cotton States, and would import
all the foreign commodities they receive in exchange.  Her ports would
become the centre of commerce between America and Europe, and, in
course of time, she would acquire for herself in the South a supremacy
similar to that which is now enjoyed by New York in the North. Mingled
with the indignation of South Carolina, therefore, there may also be
some ambitious aspirations.  There are other causes of difference
between the North and South than that of slavery.  The protective
fiscal policy which the North has succeeded in forcing <pb n="48"/>
upon the Republic has done much to prepare the way for disruptions.
Indeed, we doubt whether the slavery question, if it had stood alone,
would have occasioned such a revulsion of feeling as has evidently got
the upper hand of the South.  Not a little of it should be set down to
the protective policy whereby Northern manufacturers have flourished
at the expense of Southern planters; and thus a wilful and deliberate
departure from the sound policy of free trade has brought about its
own punishment.</p>
               <p>Are we wrong in supposing that terms of
compromise dishonourable to neither section of the Union might yet be
found, capable of reconciling all interests, and yet conforming to the
dictates of justice?  Let the North frankly reverse her protective
commercial policy, concede the principle of free trade, and declare
Charleston a free port, and she might then with more hopefulness, and,
let us add, with greater fairness, expect from the South some
concessions in regard to slavery. The exclusion of the slave system
from new territories and some amelioration of the fugitive slave laws
would, perhaps, constitute as large a demand upon the South as could
be insisted upon at present, even if both sections were more amicably
disposed towards each other than they are.  But it seems very unlikely
that the smallest point will be yielded by the South in relation to
her "domestic institution," unless she can see her way clear to an
equivalent.  The surrender to her of free trade and a free port would
be no more than she is morally entitled to.  It would show a generous
regard to her interests.  It would give scope to her natural ambition.
 It would soothe her irritated pride.  On some such terms as the
above, both parties, or perhaps it would be more correct to say
neither party, would retire victor, and, consequently, neither would
be exposed to the mortification of having been vanquished.  And the
concession on both sides would be for the interests of the Republic,
and would conduce largely to its peace, progress, and stability.</p>
               <p>If we are too sanguine in thus interpreting future
possibilities&#x2014;if the Slaves States are at present too blind and
impetuous to listen to a reasonable offer, or the Free States too
narrow in their views and too exacting to make it&#x2014;may we not at least
express a hope that time will be relied on as the most efficient and
successful peacemaker&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">time</hi>, we say, in
contradistinction from <hi rend="italic">force</hi>?  The sword may
sever peoples, but can never unite them.  We trust our American
cousins will draw instruction on this subject from the state of
Europe.  They will see Venetia tied to Austria by treaty while severed
from her by race and political sympathy, and they will see Austria,
backed by overwhelming military power, insisting upon the perpetuation
of the hateful bond. To what purpose?  To the exhaustion of her own
treasury, to the discontent of her other provinces, to the weakness of
her executive administration, to the impending ruin of her empire.
Let the Americans lay to heart the impressive warning.  "You shall" is
a hard policy for any people to digest, fully as hard on the other
side of the Atlantic as on this.  Far better to let the South go her
way, and find out, as she will when her passion is spent, how
completely she has mistaken her own interests.  Her feet will soon be
upon stony places.  If she be let alone, she will presently discover
that she is hugging to her bosom a dangerous idol.  Let her be dealt
with firmly but fairly; exact justice from her, but also give it to
her, and time will do the rest.  If she separates for ever from the
Union, the evil will not be enhanced by bitter reminiscences; but if
she wishes to retrace her steps the way will still be open to her.  In
either event it will be infinitely better for all parties to have
abstained from force.</p>
               <p>America will now have an opportunity of
observing how utterly she has been mistaken in imputing to Great
Britain a mean jealousy of her rising greatness.  So far as our
material and political interests are concerned, a disruption of the
Union would probably serve rather than injure them.  A free and direct
trade with a Southern Confederacy holds out to us a more flattering
bait than a restricted commerce with the Federal Union; while the
distribution of their international power among two or three separate
Republics would relieve us of all fear of demands tending to a breach
of the peace.  If we were really moved by jealousy, we should have
received the tidings of disruption with undisguised pleasure.  And yet
the public opinion of this country was never more sincere, never more
unanimous, in deploring the fall of a glorious edifice than it is at
this moment in prospect of the rending in twain of the Constitution of
the United States.  If we were sometimes annoyed by sallies of
petulance from our Transatlantic cousins, we entertained for them a
deep respect; we felt an unfeigned interest in the grand political
problem they had undertaken to work out; and we took pride in their
success.  We have no wish to see them weakened or humbled.  For their
own sake, and for the sake of humanity, we desired that they might
purge their noble country of the guilt of slavery.  But it is a real
grief to us to witness the maiming of America's power and the spoiling
of her national greatness; and if yet she can but settle her internal
dissensions without making a sacrifice of freedom, morality, and
conscience, no people will congratulate her upon her success more
heartily than will the population of these realms.</p>

                  The Secession Movement.
               </p>
               <p>Intelligence received
from New York to the 3rd inst. gives no indication of a peaceful
solution of the secession question.  The President has replied to the
commissioners of South Carolina, and peremptorily refused to withdraw
the troops from Charleston Harbour, and informed them that he not only
intends to collect the revenue and execute the laws, but also to
defend the property of the United States with all the force at his
command.  This firm position of the President <pb n="49"/> filled the
commissioners with consternation, and they telegraphed to Charleston
and urged the Governor to put the State on a war footing. Two war
steamers were to be dispatched to Charleston, and it was rumoured that
all the important posts in the South would be immediately reinforced.
The militia of Columbia was to be reorganised.  In the New York State
Legislature, in response to a message from the Governor, a resolution
had been proposed authorising him to tender to the national
administration 10,000 militia to put down the insurrection in the
South.</p>
               <p>Mr. Floyd, the Secretary of War, tendered his
resignation on the 29th ult., which was accepted by the President.  It
is said that there was an understanding between the President and the
Secretary on the one hand, and the Commissioners from South Carolina
on the other, that the position of military affairs at Charleston was
to undergo no alteration.  Hence the act of Major Anderson in
abandoning Fort Moultrie and occupying Fort Sumter was stigmatised as
a breach of faith by the Commissioners, who required that the troops
should return to the first-named fort, which, be it remembered, may be
easily captured, while the other, if not impregnable, is, at all
events, capable of a very stout defence. Secretary Floyd was in favour
of yielding to this demand; but a majority of the Cabinet voted for
supporting Major Anderson in the step which he had taken.  Hence the
resignation of Mr. Floyd, who could not well remain in office after
such a serious difference of opinion between himself and his
colleagues.</p>
               <p>The greatest excitement continues to prevail in
both Houses of Congress.  Senator Benjamin, of Louisiana, has
delivered a strong secession speech, which no doubt indicates
accurately the course which his State will pursue.  On the 31st of
December the Serjeant at arms was ordered to clear the galleries of
the Senate Chamber, and a resolution was carried in the House of
Representatives, directing the committee on military affairs to
inquire into the distribution of arms during the past year.</p>
               <p>South Carolina has assumed all the prerogatives of sovereignty.
She has passed ordinances for the regulation of the revenue collection
and the navigation laws.  She has authorised the Governor to appoint
ambassadors and consuls to foreign States, and also to form an
executive or cabinet council.</p>
               <p>On the 26th of December the
following ordinance was passed by the South Carolina Convention:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">An Ordinance to make Provisional Arrangements for
the continuance of the Commercial Facilities of South
Carolina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, it is due to our late confederates,
known as the United States of America, as also the citizens of South
Carolina engaged in commerce, that no abrupt or sudden change be made
in the rate of duties on imports into the State; and whereas it is not
desired by this State to secure advantages in trade to her own ports
above those of any of the slave-holding States, her late confederates
in the said union; and whereas this ordinance, for considerations
indicated, is designed to be provisional merely, therefore we, the
people of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, do declare, ordain,
and it is hereby declared and ordained;&#x2014;</p>
               <p>1. That all citizens
of this State who at the date of the ordinance of secession were
holding office connected with the customs, under the general
Government of the United States, within the limits of South Carolina,
be, and they are hereby appointed to hold, under the Government of
this State exclusively, without any further connection whatever with
the Federal Government of the United States, the same offices they now
fill, until otherwise directed, and that they receive the same pay and
emoluments for their services.</p>
               <p>2.  That until this Convention
or the General Assembly shall otherwise provide, the Governor shall
appoint to all vacancies which may occur in such offices.</p>
               <p>3.
That until it is otherwise provided by this Convention or the General
Assembly, the revenue collection and navigation laws of the United
States as far as may be practicable, be, and they are hereby adopted
and made laws of this State, saving that no duties shall be collected
upon imports from the States forming the late Federal Union, known as
the United States of America, nor upon the tonnage of vessels owned in
whole or in part by the citizens of the said States, saving and
excepting the Act of Congress adopted on the 3rd day of March, 1857,
entitled "An Act authorising the deposit of the papers of foreign
vessels with the Consuls of their respective nations," which said Act
is hereby declared to be of do [sic] force within the limits of this
State.</p>
               <p>4.  All vessels built in South Carolina or elsewhere,
and owned to the amount of one-third by a citizen or citizens of South
Carolina, or any of the slave-holding commonwealths of North America,
and commanded by citizens thereof, and no other, shall be registered
as vessels of South Carolina, under the authority of the collector and
naval officer.</p>
               <p>5.  All official acts of the officers
aforesaid, in which it is usual and proper to set forth the authority
under which they act, or style of documents issued by thenr[sic] or
any of them, shall be in the name of the State of South Carolina.</p>
               <p>6.  All moneys hereafter collected by any officers aforesaid
shall, after deducting the sums necessary for the compensation of the
officers and other expenses, be paid into the treasury of the State of
South Carolina, for the use of the said State, subject to the order of
this Convention, or the General Assembly.</p>
               <p>7.  The officers
aforesaid shall retain in their hands all property of the United
States in their possession, custody, or control, subject to the
disposal of the State, who will account for the same upon a final
settlement with the Governor of the United States.</p>
               <p>Done at
Charleston the 26th day of December, in the year of our Lord,
1860.</p>
               <p>B.F. Arthur, Clerk. <hi rend="right">D.F. JAMISON,</hi>
President.</p>
               <p>Governor Pickens, of South Carolina, had issued the
following proclamation:&#x2014;</p>
               <p rend="right">Executive Department, Charleston,
S.C.,</p>
               <p rend="right">December 24, 1860.</p>
               <p>By his Excellency Francis W.
Pickens, Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the State of
South Carolina:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>Whereas, the good people of this State, in
Convention assembled, by an ordinance unanimously adopted and ratified
on the twentieth day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty, repealed an ordinance of the people of this
State adopted on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of our Lord
one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, and have thereby
dissolved the Union between the State of South Carolina and other
States, under the name of the United States of America.</p>
               <p>I,
therefore, as Governor and Commander-in-Chief in and over the State of
South Carolina, by virtue of authority in me vested, do hereby
proclaim to the world that this State is, as she has a right to be, a
separate, sovereign, free, and independent State; and, as such, has a
right to levy war, conclude peace, negotiate treaties, leagues, or
covenants, and to do all acts whatsoever that rightly appertain to a
free and independent State.</p>
               <p>Given under my hand and the seal
of this State, at Charleston, this twenty-forth day of December, in
the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty, and in the
eighty-fifth year of the sovereignty and independence of South
Carolina.</p>
               <p rend="right">F.W. Pickens.</p>
               <p>The <title>Charleston
Mercury</title> thus describes the signing of the Secession
Ordinance:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>The scene was one profoundly grand and impressive.
 There were a people assembled through their highest
representatives&#x2014;men most of them upon whose heads the snow of sixty
winters had been shed&#x2014;patriarchs in age&#x2014;the dignitaries of the
land&#x2014;the high priests of the church of Christ&#x2014;reverend
statesmen&#x2014;and the wise judges of the law.  In the midst of deep
silence an old man, with bowed form and hair white as snow, the Rev.
Dr. Bachman, advanced forward, with upraised hands, in prayer to
Almighty God, for his blessing and favour in this good act of his
people about to be consummated.  The whole assembly at once rose to
its feet, and, with hats off, listened to the touching and eloquent
appeal to the All Wise Dispenser of Events.  At the close of the
prayer the President advanced with the consecrated parchment upon
which was inscribed the decision of the State, with the great seal
attached.  Slowly and solemnly it was read to the last word&#x2014;dissolved;
when men could contain themselves no longer, and a shout that shook
the very building, reverberating, long continued, rose to heaven, and
ceased only with the loss of breath.  In proud, grave silence, the
Convention itself waited the end with beating hearts.  The members of
the Convention then advanced, one by one, and placed their signature
to the ordinance, after which, amidst the most tumultuous applause,
the President proclaimed the State of South Carolina a separate,
independent nationality.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> case of the
fugitive slave Anderson, whom a decision of the Courts in Canada has
decreed to be delivered up to the Government of the United States
under the Extradition Treaty with this country, had already excited
considerable public attention; but the result of a recent application on
his behalf to the Court of Queen's Bench at Westminster has given the
matter a new and still more important interest.  We believe that the
parties who have applied for and obtained a writ of habeas corpus in
this matter are acting on behalf of the Anti-Slavery Society; and,
certainly, a very remarkable and, it may prove, a very large question
has been raised by that proceeding.  Apart from international
considerations, and all that relates to the subject of the Extradition
Treaty, it is now to be seen what effect the direct action of the
supreme Courts in this country on colonial jurisdiction will produce.
Of the existing and abstract power of the Courts in England to issue a
writ of the peculiar nature of a habeas corpus there is, we believe,
no doubt; but, when the constitution of such a colony as Canada and
its connection with the mother country are seriously considered, a
difficulty arises, and a curious anomaly becomes apparent.  To all
practical intents and purposes the legislative and judicial functions
of our North American provinces are independent and self-existent; and
there has been a time when the immediate and positive interference of
any authority at home with the discharge of the duties of the colonial
Courts might have proved a dangerous experiment.  As things are, there
has probably never been a moment when any such question would have
been likely to be treated with more temper and forbearance in Canada
than just now; but, nevertheless, we cannot but think that the matter
will not pass wholly without comment or protest, if nothing more.  The
policy which has guided our colonial rule for some years past can
hardly be said to have been gratuitous on the part of the home
Government, and the independent attitude which Canada now holds has
been gained rather than granted.  While agreeing that every possible
sympathy ought to be felt for the unhappy object of this difficulty,
and far from admitting that the construction put on the Extradition
Treaty in this particular case of the Canadian Courts of Law is
unassailable, we cannot disguise from ourselves that a very weighty
and urgent responsibility is involved in the issue which has been
raised as between the home and colonial judicatures.  Separate from
and beside all legal niceties and technicalities, a very broad
principle is likely to be brought into, we hope, friendly and
temperate dispute; and it is almost inevitable that a more accurate
and deoided [sic] definition of the mutual relations between Great
Britain and those which are known as her self-governing dependencies
will have ere long to be laid down.  This subject must, owing to the
singular circumstances which have arisen, necessarily occupy the
attention of Parliament in the coming Session, even if it does not
lead to some remarkable legislative proceedings.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Forts in Charleston
               Harbour</hi>.&#x2014;Fort Moultrie is
situated on Sullivan's Island, at the mouth of the harbour, and about
three miles, in a direct line, from the city.  It is (if not
destroyed) an inclosed water battery, with a front on the water side
of about 300 feet, and a depth of about 250 feet.  The work was
constructed with salient and re-entering angles on all sides, so as to
adapt it admirably for defence, either from the attack of a storming
party or regular approaches.  The outer and inner walls are of brick,
capped with stone, filled in with earth, so as to make a solid
structure 16 feet in thickness.  Within the last month the fort has
been very much strengthened by closing the postern gates, by cutting
sallyports, by placing 12-pounder howitzer guns in the angles, so as
to command all points, by the digging of a ditch 15 feet wide and 15
feet deep, and by other improvements that added materially to its
defensive capacity. The garrison consisted of about 70 men, including
officers and musicians.  Fort Moultrie is memorable for the victory
gained by the American troops, commanded by Colonel Moultrie, over a
British squadron, commanded by Sir Peter Parker, Jan. 28, 1776.  The
British force consisted of a fleet of 40 or 50 sail, and the opposing
force of 433 men, rank and file.  The fort was hastily constructed.
In its general plan it presented a square, with a bastion at each
angle, built of palmetto logs, dovetailed and bolted together, and
laid in parallel rows 16 feet asunder; between these rows the space
was filled with sand.  In the engagement, which lasted from ten a.m.
till nine p.m., and which was one of the fiercest of the Revolutionary
war, the British were defeated, their loss being 225 killed and
wounded, while the American loss was 11 killed and 26 wounded.  Fort
Moultrie was subsequently rebuilt on an enlarged scale, so as to
render it one of the most extensive fortresses on the coast.  Fort
Sumter is a work of solid masonry, octagonal in form, is classed as
one of the strongest fortifications in the country, and is generally
regarded as being as nearly impregnable as possible.  It is situated
about the centre of the harbour, on the edge of the ship channel, some
three-fourths of a mile from Fort Moultrie, and near three and a half
miles from the city of Charleston, which it commands, as it also does
Fort Moultrie and Castle Pinckney.  It is situated on an island,
though it seems to rise directly out of the water.  It is pierced on
the north, east, and west sides with a double row of portholes for the
heaviest guns, and on the south or land side, in addition to openings
for guns, is loopholed for musketry, and is bombproof.  The armament
of Fort Sumter consists of 140 guns, many of them being the formidable
10-in.  "Columbiades," which throw either shot or shell, and which
have a fearful range. There is in the magazine a large amount of
artillery stores, consisting of about 40,000 lb. of powder, in
addition to what has now been removed there from the abandoned
fortress, and a proportionate quantity of shot and shell.  The wharf
or landing of Fort Sumter is on the south side, and is, of course,
exposed to cross fire from all the openings on that side.  A large
number of workmen have been engaged for several weeks in mounting guns
and placing this fort in condition for any emergency that might arise.
 General Scott, it is said, pronounces the fortification, when manned,
one of the strongest in the world.  Castle Pinckney is located on the
southern extremity of a narrow slip of marsh land, which extends in a
northerly direction to Hog Island Channel.  To the harbour side the
so-called castle presents a circular front.  It has never been
regarded as a work of first magnitude, although its proximity to the
city would, if garrisoned, give it importance.  Recently some
improvements have been made in and about the fort, with a view of
strengthening it.  Commanded as it is by Fort Sumter, it cannot be
assailed.  It has several Columbiades, and a full supply of powder,
shell, and shot.&#x2014; <title>New York Tribune</title>.</p>

               <p>The latest advices from New
York show no signs of reconciliation between the contending States.
Indeed the breach is widening daily.  Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama,
and Florida, have seceded, and, like South Carolina, constituted
themselves into independent Republics.  Virginia is preparing to adopt
a similar course.  The secessionists have taken possession of several
of the forts in Louisiana, and the Federal troops have abandoned most
of the forts in Pensacola.  The New York State has offered the whole
State force for the service of the general Government.  President
Buchanan's promised Message to Congress is said to throw the
responsibility on that body, to whom he suggests the Missouri
compromise.  At the same time we are informed that Mr. Seward, the
avowed enemy to all compromise, has accepted the post of Premier under
Mr. Lincoln. Mr. Thompson, the Secretary of the Interior, has
resigned.  At Charleston the Star of the West, with reinforcements for
Major Anderson, has been fired into by the South Carolinians.  When
the sloop of war Brooklyn arrives at Charleston it is supposed that a
serious encounter will take place.  The Congress has not hitherto hit
on any plan for the adjustment of the dispute.</p>
               <p>A
Washington telegram of the 8th instant says:&#x2014; "Mr. Thompson, the
Secretary of the Interior, resigned to-day, on the ground that troops
had been sent to Charleston by the steamer Star of the West, when, as
he alleges, there was a distinct understanding on the 31st of December
that none were to be ordered south without the decision of the
Cabinet.  Agents of Southern States continue to arrive for the purpose
of purchasing arms. The Government for the present refuses to sell any
to State or private parties.  A number of the leading Secessionists
here are urging upon Governor Hicks, of Maryland, and Letcher, of
Virginia, the necessity of demanding of the President an immediate
removal of United States' troops from Fort Washington.  The armament
of Fort Washington is in excellent condition, and preparations have
been made for firing red-hot balls that will burn any vessel which may
attempt to pass the forts for hostile purposes.  The Naval Department
has received information this morning that the revenue cutter Dophin,
lying in Mobile harbour, has the United States' flag flying with the
Union down, and the Palmetto flag flying at the mainmast.  This act,
on the part of those having the vessel in charge, is considered open
revolution before the secession of the State of Alabama."</p>
               <p>The
8th of January, being the anniversary of the battle of New Orleans,
was devoted to a great consumption of gunpowder all over the Union in
honour of General Jackson's victory; and in most of the Northern
States in honour also of Major Anderson's course at <pb n="72"/>
Charleston.  The occasion was also seized in the New York State Senate
to pass a resolution to present a sword to Major Anderson.  General
Jackson's proclamation against nullification was also read, on the
motion of Mr. Spinola.</p>

               <p>Two hundred men, with 130
horses, left Fort Leavenworth for Baltimore on the 7th.</p>
               <p>The
reinforcements sent to Fort Sumter consisted of 250 artillerists and
marines, with ample supplies of provisions and arms, and were put on
board the Star of the West in the Lower Bay, New York, at night, so as
not to attract attention.  Troops have been sent from Baltimore to
Harper's Ferry to protect the arsenal.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A telegram from
Washington of the 5th says that the committee of the Border States,
including Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and North
Carolina, from the South, and New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
Illinois, &#x0026;c., from the North, had agreed upon propositions for an
adjustment of pending difficulties, by amending the Constitution as
follows:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>1. Recommending a repeal of all the Personal
Liberty Eills [sic].  2. That the Fugitive Slave Law be amended for
the preventing of kidnapping, and so as to provide for the
equalisation of the Commissioners' fee, &#x0026;c.  3.  That the
Constitution be so amended as to prohibit any interference with
slavery in any of the States where it now exists.  4.  That the
Congress shall not abolish slavery in the Southern dockyards,
arsenals, &#x0026;c., nor in the district of Columbia without the consent
of Maryland and the consent of the inhabitants of the district, nor
without compensation.  5.  That Congress shall not interfere with the
inter-State slave trade.  6.  That there shall be a perpetual
prohibition of the African slave trade.  7.  That the line of 36
degress [sic] 30 minutes shall be run through all the existing
territory of the United States; that in all north of that line slavery
shall be prohibited, and that south of that line neither Congress nor
the Territorial Legislature shall hereafter pass any law abolishing,
prohibiting, or in any manner interfering with African slavery; and th
t [sic] when any territory containing a sufficient population for one
member o [sic] Congress in any area of 60,000 square miles shall apply
for admission as a State, it shall be admitted, with or without
slavery, as its Constitution may determine.</p>
               <p>We read in a
Washington letter:&#x2014; "The compromise proposed by the Committee of
Border States is not accepted by the South.  The South will not
consent to leaving the territories south of 36 deg. 30 min. to be free
or slave as the people may elect, believing that, by leaving the
question open, the scenes of Kansas will be revived, and the country
overrun with anti-slavery people, through the agency of the Northern
emigrant aid societies. They demand the unequivocal recognition by the
North that slavery shall exist in territory south of the proposed
line, until it shall be divided into States, when, in their sovereign
capacity as States, they may alter or confirm their status in regard
to slavery.  In other words, all territory North shall be considered
free, and all South slave, unless the people shall chose to change the
condition after their Government shall be clothed with State
authority."</p>
               <p>It is said that Mr. Lincoln has authorised Mr.
Seward and Thurlow Weed to agree to any compromise that "New York and
Pennsylvania will stand upon."</p>
               <p>We read in the <title>New York
Herald</title>:&#x2014; "A strong effort is being made to carry the
proposition adopted by the Border State Committee through the two
Houses of Congress.  The Senate will undoubtedly adopt it, but it is
believed that there may be found enough Secessionists to vote with the
Republicans to defeat it in the House."</p>
               <p rend="center">A
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.</p>
               <p>The Republican members of the House
held a caucus on the 5th inst. upon the present state of
affairs&#x2014;Speaker Pennington in the chair.  There was a full
attendance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Hale, of Pennsylvania, brought up the report
from the Sub-Committee of the border States, who said that he believed
the members of his committee representing the border Slave States
would agree to his proposition that all the territory of the United
States north of 36 deg. 30 min. should be free, and all south of that
line to remain as it is, with liberty to the people to organise into
States whenever they please, with or without slavery.  He was of
opinion that it might be better for the North to take this proposition
than to precipitate the country into war.  Mr. Howard, of Michigan,
objected to any compromise.  Mr. Lovejoy, of Illinois, speaking of the
malcontents of the Slave States, and the proposed compromise of
dividing the territory between freedom and slavery to the Pacific,
said:- "There never was a more causeless revolt since Lucifer led his
cohorts of apostate angels against the throne of God; but I never
heard that the Almighty proposed to compromise the matter by allowing
the rebels to kindle the fires of hell south of the celestial meridian
of thirty-six thirty."  This outburst created a deal of sensation and
some movement. Mr. Sherman stated that, as a member of the Border
Sub-Committee from the Border States, he could neither vote for the
proposition proposed by Mr. Hale, nor that proposed by Mr. Crittenden,
to restore the Missouri line and extend it to the Pacific.  He was
also opposed to the compromise to prevent the abolition of slavery in
the district of Columbia.  While he did not wish to abolish it now, he
was opposed to yielding up the right of Congress to do so at any
future period. Mr. Grow, of Pennsylvania, expressed himself decidedly
opposed to all compromises.  Messrs. Hickman and Stevens, of
Pennsylvania, and Case, of Indiana, opposed all compromises in
speeches couched in unmistakable language.  The caucus unanimously
agreed to press the business of the country in the House.  Mr. Dawes,
of Massachusetts, moved that no vote be taken on any of the
propositions, and that the caucus adjourn <hi rend="italic">sine
die</hi>, which was carried.  The caucus was fully attended, and was
harmonious at the close against all compromise.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">SOUTHERN CAUCUS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senators of those
Southern States which had called Conventions met at Washington and
adopted the following resolutions:&#x2014;1st.  We recommend to our States
immediate secession. 2nd.  We recommend holding a Convention at
Montgomery, Alabama, on a day not later than the 15th of February, and
establishing a Southern Confederacy.  Another resolution was passed,
considered confidential, but understood to pledge the Senators to
remain at Washington, and defeat army and navy appropriations, and
other bills, if proposed.</p>
               <p>In Maine, Ohio, and Illinois there
was a disposition to repeal or amend he [sic] Personal Liberty Bills,
but in all the right of secession is denied.  Governor Wood, of
Illinois, said he spoke the sentiments of the whole population of the
State in adopting the sentiments of President Jackson&#x2014; "The Federal
Union&#x2014;it must be preserved."</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">From</hi> America the news becomes graver than ever.  The South
Carolina secessionists have fired upon the soldiers of the Government,
and treason has become actual rebellion.  The frigate Brooklyn had
been despatched to the aid of the Federal troops.  The movement is
spreading, and the adhesion of new States to the secession group was
daily expected.  The conduct of the President, at length roused into
action, had excited the utmost indignation in the South, and the
Commissioners who had been dispatched to treat with him have addressed
him in a letter which Mr. Buchanan declined to receive.  On the other
hand, the North is by no means backward in strengthening his hands,
and offering him men and arms, and it is quite evident that the time
for compromise has gone by.  It is too late to speculate what might
have been the result had the Message been as firm as the later
communications of the President to the South; but the journals of the
latter are energetic in declaring that he could have done no good, and
that not even the election of Mr. Lincoln was the proximate cause of
the rebellion, for that the South had long resolved to make a stand
against the "fanaticism" and the oppressive finance advocated by the
North. Mr. Lincoln has framed his Administration, and his chief
subordinate will be Mr. Seward, a very determined anti-Southerner,
whose appointment speaks strongly for the character of Mr. Lincoln's
policy. Mr. Seward has talked some nonsense of the "bunkum" kind about
the seizure of Canada, but this he will now, being in a responsible
position, be inclined speedily to forget, and we shall be happy to
imitate him.  General Cameron will be the War Secretary.  The
<title>New York Herald</title> sarcastically recommends Mr. Horace
Greeley, its <hi rend="italic">b&#x00EA;te noir</hi> (whom it has called
Massa Greeley, in ridicule of his compassion for the slaves), to hurry
to Mr. Lincoln and try and secure some "fat things;" adding, in the
elegant language of American politicians, that he will otherwise be
left out in the cold.  These personalities are acceptable, it seems,
even in the midst of the most disastrous crisis of modern history, and
we only wish that we could discern in the fact that levity is
tolerated, any proof that is thought there will be no actual appeal to
arms.  The utmost distress is prevailing in various quarters in the
South; business is at a standstill; and the war fever sadly replaces
the legitimate excitement of enterprise and commerce. An effort will
be made to show that the blacks take part with their owners; but a few
isolated cases of what it is hardly right to call fidelity will not
balance the evidence that any thinking person must draw from the
precautions the owners are compelled to take against an outbreak.  We
should rejoice to hear that the presence of a large Federal force had
made so fearful a revolt impossible.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Buchanan sent a special message to Congress on
the 9th ult., on the state of the Union, and it was referred to
Special Committees.  He leaves to that body the responsibility of
initiating a war policy, while at the same time he strongly condemns
the conduct of the seceding States in taking possession of Federal
property, and justifies the employment of defensive measures.  He
expresses his approval of the proposal to draw a line, on one side of
which slavery may, and on the other it may not, exist.  The only
suggestion he makes is, that a National Convention should be held for
the purpose of considering measures of adjustment.</p>
               <p>The
largest crowd that ever assembled inside the Senate House met on the
12th ult. to hear the speech of the Hon. W. H. Seward  on the national
crisis.  The full Diplomatic Corps were in attendance, the galleries
were crammed almost to suffocation, and numbers went away unable to
obtain admission. Mr. Seward's remarks were listened to with the most
profound attention.  He said, "Mutual recrimination and Congressional
compromises are not likely to save the Union.  The Constitution of the
United States and the laws made in pursuance thereto are supreme.  The
laws of the land are paramount to all State legislation.  The Union
can only be dissolved by the voluntary consent of the people of the
United States in the manner prescribed by the Constitution.  The
Congress ought, if it can, to redress any real grievances of the
offended States, and should then supply the President with the means
necessary to maintain the authority of the Union."  Mr. Seward then
proceeded to point out the numerous advantages of the Union, "while a
dissolution," he said, "will be perpetual civil war."  He concluded by
saying that when the angry excitement had sudsided [sic] and calmness
had resumed its sway, and not till then, would he advise that a
Convention of the people be assembled to consider what amendments in
the organic national law ought to be made.</p>
               <p>No proceedings
have grown out of Mr. Seward's speech, but it was <pb n="89"/> said to
have exercised a soothing effect upon the public mind.  It had,
however, failed to give entire satisfaction to the members of the
Senator's own party.  Mr. Crittenden's resolutions were still kept in
abeyance in the Senate.  Mr. Bigler, of Pennsylvania, presented a bill
proposing amendments to the Constitution, substantially the same as
those proposed by Mr. Crittenden; but it is obvious from the tone
adopted by the Republican party, and especially by their leading
organs in the press, that they will never agree to a partition of the
territories in the interest of slavery.  A part of Mr. Bigler's scheme
was to submit the compromise to a popular vote on the 12th of
February.  A show of resistance to the passing of the Army and Navy
Appropriation Bills was made by the Southern representatives, but a
compromise was effected in the shape of an agreement that a three
days' debate on the subject should take place.  The proceedings of
Congress on the 18th of January were unusually important.  In the
Senate a motion to reconsider the vote whereby the Crittenden
adjustment was laid on the table was reconsidered, all the Republicans
voting against.  A motion was then made to insert Mr. Bigler's plan,
and it was made the special order for Monday.  There are indications
that lead to the belief that this will pass.  The remainder of the
Session was devoted to the bill for the admission of Kansas.  In the
House the debate on the crisis was continued, and concluded by Mr.
Sherman, of Ohio.</p>
               <p>The Bremen, which arrived at Southhampton
on Wednesday, brings us the announcement that Georgia has followed the
example of her sister States of South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama,
and Florida, and has withdrawn from the Union.  The secession
resolution was adopted on the 17th ult., when the State Convention
formally resolved that it was the duty of Georgia to secede from the
Union, and appointed a committee to draw up an ordinance of secession.
The resolution was strongly opposed in the Convention, having been
carried by only a majority of 165 to 136 votes.</p>
               <p>The New York
Democratic State Committee, in view of the alarming condition of the
country, had issued a call for an election of four delegates in each
Assembly district, to hold a State Convention at Albany on the 31st of
January.</p>
               <p>Florida has appointed delegates to a Southern
Congress.</p>
               <p>The Virginia House of Representatives has passed a
bill appropriating 1,000,000 dollars for the defence of the State, and
a bill authorising the issue of Treasury notes to that amount, bearing
six per cent interest.</p>
               <p>Several forts and the Baton Rouge
Arsenal had been taken in Louisiana by the Secessionists.  Armed
bodies of Florida and Alabama troops had seized the Pensacola
Navy-yard, which contained a considerable quantity of warlike stores.
The steamer Fulton was also captured.  The Crusader and the Wynadotte
only escaped by getting up steam and moving out of harm's way.</p>
               <p>Commissioners from South Carolina had arrived in Washington for the
purpose of demanding the evacuation of Fort Sumter, with a threat to
attack the fort if it should not be surrendered.  Their request would,
we are assured, be rejected by President Buchanan.</p>
               <p>The Star
of the West had returned to New York with troops, and with her bows
damaged by a shot.  It appears that it was not until several shots had
actually struck her that the Star of the West desisted from the
attempt to convey reinforcements to Fort Sumter.  Major Anderson
threatened, in consequence of the stoppage of his reinforcements, to
prevent any ships from entering Charleston harbour, but ultimately
resolved to delay action until he should have received orders from
Washington.  The British Consul at Charleston has written to the
Secretary of the Admiralty to say that the <hi rend="italic">de
facto</hi> Government of South Carolina had not only caused the
lighthouse beacons, buoys, &#x0026;c, of that coast and harbour to be
removed, but that it had sunk vessels in all the channels excepting
one.  This channel will only be navigable for vessels of light
draught.  The South Carolina authorities have notified to Major
Anderson their determination to capture the fort if not
surrendered.</p>
               <p>An enthusiastic demonstration by working men
against coercing the Southern States was held in New York City on the
evening of the 14th ult.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The fortifications on the southern coast are
described as follows:&#x2014;  "There are along the coast of the Slave
States, from Baltimore to Barrataria Bay, Lousiana, twenty-nine
fortifications, that cost the Government 15,000,000 dollars.  They
contain more than 3000 cannon.  This is a good outfit for the Southern
revolutionists, added to their ample supply of small arms at the
arsenals and armories, which had an increase of 325,000 within twelve
months.  In addition there are incomplete works at Ship Island,
Mississippi River; Georgetown, South Carolina; Typee Islands, Port
Royal Roads, South Carolina; Typee Islands, Savannah; Galveston,
Brazos, Santiago, and
Matagorda Bay, Texas.  The guns which were lately stopped at Pittsburg
[sic] were designed for those at Galveston and Ship Island.  Hampton
roads is the great naval d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t station and rendezvous of the southern
coasts, and the only good roadstead on the Atlantic south of the
Delaware.  Pensacola is very strong, and the only good harbour for
vessels of war, and the only naval d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t on the Gulf.  The fortresses
at Key West and Tortugas, on the southern part of Florida, are among
the most powerful in the world; and every vessel that crosses the Gulf
passes within sight of both."</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">South Carolina</hi>, like the other States of America, has a well-known
distinctive name, that of the "Palmetto State," a designation arising
from the prolific growth of this species of fan palm in its marshy
districts.  The specimen represented in our Engraving grows in the
slave market of Charleston, within a stone's throw of the Exchange and
Post Office.  Thus a good deal of Southern life centres round it.  An
iron railing preserves it in the midst of the jostling dealers,
bidding eagerly for gangs of "likely negroes," whose brawny arms seem
just now more likely to be tasked in raising defensive earthworks than
in cultivating either cotton plantations or rice fields.  Women and
children are being sold; but, as shown in our Engraving below, not
always to unkind masters.  Many hands are purchased, and become a
profitable investment to their owners by being allowed to keep shops
or to vend wares in the streets, a certain percentage of the profits
going to the slaves' masters.</p>
               <p>If one may judge of the
briskness of the trade by the broad grin on Daphne's face as either
Affy or Dinah is seen bargaining for her sweet potatoes or her
bananas, assuredly here will be found successful speculation.</p>
               <p>But lounging from the street towards the Hotel you are struck with
interest of quite another kind.  The heart of the town seems to beat
always at its highest in the entrance-hall of the hotel, which is
always crowded, as indicated in our Engraving on the first page.  You
notice porters heaving endless baggage coming from opposite points of
the compass, whether from New York or Havannah, strewing the centre of
the hall.  Here you can't help overhearing the latest intelligence
from Washington, the last speech of the President, or the chances of
future secessions.  A gentleman at the bar takes down your name and
indicates the number of your bedroom.  Once in that abode of rest, you
notice defensive apparatus again [sic] the mosquitoes.  Looking
outside the windows, you notice turkey buzzards perched on the
roof-ledge: these are the town scavengers.  Your attention is suddenly
distracted from these operations by the sound of the gong which
announces dinner, and a really sumptuous repast restores you to a
sense of Southern luxury and Carolinian hospitality.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The
intelligence from the United States is of a mixed character.  Colonel
Hayne, commanding the States' forces in Florida, had telegraphed to
President Buchanan that he would not attack Fort Pickens, and that the
Southern States would avoid a collision, in the hope of an amicable
adjustment, and from a desire to preserve peace. On the other hand,
the secession movement continues.  The senators from Florida, Alabama,
and Mississippi have withdrawn from the Senate, and Georgia has signed
a secession ordinance.  The financial state of the Government is also
unsatisfactory.  The Secretary of the Treasury has reported that the
expenditure for carrying on the Government till the 1st of July will
exceed the revenue by 20,000,000 dollars.  The Senate had passed the
bill for the admission of Kansas into the Union. Mr. Crittenden's
proposals for a compromise continued to be discussed, but nothing had
yet come of the discussion.  Mr. Douglas had prepared an amendment to
the Constitution, which he intended to offer as a substitute for Mr.
Crittenden's resolutions.  This scheme proposes to deprive Congress of
the power to prohibit slavery in the territories and to abolish the
inter-State slave trade; it gives greater force to the Fugitive Slave
Law; and it prohibits the coloured race from exercising any of the
rights of citizenship, whether Federal, State, territorial, or
municipal.  It was proposed to suspend mail communication with the
seceding States, and it seems to be thought that so simple a measure
will damp secessionist ardour.  It having been rumoured in New York
that the Navy-yard would be attacked, marines were ordered under arms,
and large police forces were held in readiness to act, but no attack
took place.  General Scott was fortifying Washington with increased
zeal.  The Augusta Arsenal in Georgia has been surrendered to State
troops.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">This</hi> seaport city, capital of a
district of the same name in the State of South Carolina, stands on a
tongue of land formed by the junction of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers.
 The bay is a large estuary formed by the confluence of the two
rivers, and extends about seven miles south-east from Charleston to
the ocean, having an average width of two miles.  A sandbar extends
across its mouth, but there are several channel entrances, the deepest
of which passes close to Sullivan's Island.  Cooper and Ashley Rivers
are both deep, and capable of accommodating the largest class of
vessels; the former being 1400 and the latter 2100 yards wide opposite
the city.  The harbour is open to easterly winds, and vessels in it
are much exposed during storms from that quarter.  Charleston, one of
the oldest cities in the Union, was founded as early as 1672, and was
first called Oysterpoint Town.  It soon became a place of considerable
trade, and was chartered as a city in 1783.  The ground on which it is
built is low, being only eight or nine feet above high tide, which
rises here about six feet; and the city has several times suffered
from inundations by the water of the harbour being driven up by
violent winds.  The city is regularly laid out in parallel streets
running east and west from the Cooper to the Ashley, and intersected
by others nearly at right angles.  The streets, which vary in width
from thirty-five to seventy feet, are lined with a tree termed the
"Pride of India;" while elegant villas, adorned with verandahs, and
surrounded with orange-trees, magnolias, and palmettos, add much to
the elegance and beauty of the city.  The population of Charleston in
1850 was 42,985, of whom 14,692 were slaves: this was exclusive of the
suburb St. Philip, which contains about 16,000 inhabitants.  The
Number of this Journal for the 19th ult. contained a description of
the forts in Charleston harbour.  A despatch, of which the following
is a copy, has been received by the Secretary of the Admiralty from
Mr. Bunch, her Majesty's Consul at Charleston, relative to the
obstruction of the entrances to the harbour at that place by the local
Government:&#x2014;"British Consulate, Charleston, Jan. 11, 1861.&#x2014;Sir,&#x2014;In
my letter of the 3rd inst. I had the honour to acquaint you that the
<hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government of the State of South
Carolina had caused the lighthouse, beacons, buoys, &#x0026;c., of this
coast and harbour to be extinguished and removed.  I now have to
state that, in addition to these very summary measures, the same
authorities have seen fit to close all the channels leading into the
harbour by sinking vessels in them, except Moffitts' Channel, which
may be said to be available for vessels drawing only 14 feet 6 inches
of water."</p>

<p rend="center">A BRITISH RAILWAY FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE PACIFIC.</p>
               <p>.  . . . In the United States the project of a
railway to the Pacific to cross the Rocky Mountains has ebbed and
flowed in public opinion, and has been made the battle-cry of parties
for years past, but nothing has been done.  Such a project, in order
to answer its purpose, requires something more than a practicable
surface or convenient mountain passes.  Fine harbours on both oceans,
facilities for colonisation on the route, and the authority of one
single Power over the whole of the wild regions traversed, are all
essential to success.  As regards the United States these conditions
are wanting.  While there are harbours enough on the Atlantic, though
none equal to Halifax, there is no available harbour, at all fit for
the great Pacific trade, from Acapulco to our harbour of Esquimalt on
Vancouver's Island, except San Francisco-and that is in the wrong
place, and is, in many states of the wind, unsafe and inconvenient.
The country north-west of the Missouri is found to be sterile, and at
least one-third of the whole United States' territory, and situated in
this region, is now known as "the Great American Desert."  Again, the
conflicting interests of separate and Sovereign States present an
almost insuperable bar to agreement as to route, or as to future
"operations" or control.  It is true that Mr. Seward, possibly as the
exponent of the policy of the new President, promises to support <hi rend="italic">two</hi> Pacific railways&#x2014;one for the South, another
for the North.  But these promises are little better than political
baits, and were they carried out into acts of Congress financial
disturbance would delay, if not prevent, their final realisation; and
even if realised they would not serve the great wants of the East and
the West, still less would they satisfy England and Europe.  We,
therefore, cannot look for the execution of this gigantic work at the
hands of the United States.</p>

               <p>Virginia has assumed the
office of a mediator, and President Buchanan has sent a special
message to Congress relative to the resolutions of the Virginian
Legislature for a peaceful settlement of the existing differences.
The resolutions invite all States, slaveholding and non-slaveholding,
to appoint commissioners to meet at Washington similar commissioners
appointed by Virginia to consider and, if possible, agree on some
suitable adjustment.  One of the resolutions requests the President to
agree to abstain in the mean time from any act calculated to produce a
collision of arms between the States and the Federal Government.  The
President expresses his conviction that he does not possess the
requisite power, and that Congress alone can exercise it.  He
accordingly recommends that body to abstain from passing any law
calculated to produce a collision during the contemplated general
assembly at Virginia, which he trusts may be the destined means of
perpetuating the Union.</p>
               <p>The secession ordinance had been
passed in the Louisiana Convention by a vote of 113 yeas against 17
nays.  A resolution declaring the navigation of the Mississippi to be
free to all friendly Powers was also passed unanimously.  The
Louisiana state troops had seized the United States' Marines Hospital
at New Orleans, and had ordered the immediate removal of the patients,
the hospital being required for the troops of the State.  The State of
Texas has gone for disunion.  But present appearances show that
Virginia will act with the other border States and oppose secession.
A deputation of bankers from New York city had arrived at Washington
for the purpose of inducing Congress to make concessions to the
South.</p>
               <p>The House passed on the 28th ult. the Senate bill for
the admission of Kansas, which thus becomes the thirty-fourth State of
the Union, and the nineteenth Free State.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">United
States</hi>.&#x2014;Londonderry, Thursday.&#x2014;the Canadian screw-steamer North
Briton has arrived here and landed all mails.  At Washington, on the
31st ult., Mr. Seward presented the New York petition favourable to
the adoption of resolutions for an adjustment on the Border States'
plan.  This petition bore 38,000 signatures.  The impression gathered
from Mr. Seaward's [sic] speech was that the incoming Administration
had resolved upon a coercive policy towards the South should the
endeavours for a peaceful settlement fail.  On the 31st ult. the grand
jury found indictments against Floyd, Russell, and Bailey for having
defrauded the Government.  The New York Legislature had decided on
sending nine Commissioners to Washington, the majority of whom were to
decide how the votes of the whole were to be cast.  Charleston was
quiet.  California was strong for the union.  Their Assembly had
failed to elect a President after seventy-two ballots.</p>

                  <hi rend="italic">(From Our Special Correspondent.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">I Arrived</hi>
in Richmond, the capital of Old Virginia, on a Sunday afternoon, and
found the whole slave population in the streets.  I was much struck
with the general well-to-do look of these people, for I had imagined
they would have wretched, down-trodden appearance showing marks of
ill-usage, and be afraid to look up at strangers; instead of which I
found them well dressed, well fed, and apparently happy and contented;
but I was looking on the surface only, I suppose.</p>
               <p>I had a
letter of introduction to a gentleman in the city, which I lost no
time in delivering, and explained to him that my object in visiting
the capital of the Old Dominion was to see what I could of slave
institutions, and more particularly a slave auction, with the
intention of writing an account of it, and also making some sketches,
if possible, to be published in an English newspaper.  My friend said
this was rather a serious matter, for the Southerners had been so
grossly libelled and misrepresented by novelists and newspaper-writers
that they had got into a bad habit of not thinking of them or treating
them in a kindly spirit; on the contrary, they rather manifested a
desire to tar and feather them.  I begged of my friend to understand
that if these very worthy people did object to my sketching and taking
notes I would promise not to do anything of the kind, and I began to
wish myself in the district of Columbia again, for a sensation of
stickiness had come over me in consequence of his tar-and-feather
allusions.  However, he would consult, he said, with a gentlemen of
influence in the place, let me know the result, and advise me how best
to proceed.</p>
               <p>During the time he was absent I walked round the
city, which is well built, chiefly of red brick and stone.  The James
River runs through it, entering at one end, a noisy torrent, tumbling
helterskelter over huge masses of rock, through a variety of channels,
with beautiful picturesque islands between them, and running out at
the other through quiet valleys and pasture lands.  There are a dock
and quay at the lower end, where small vessels lie, and a canal to
connect the upper and lower navigations.  Numbers of tall chimneys
peer above the housetops, indicating the positions of the tobacco
factories, which abound throughout the city.</p>
               <p>Taking up a
station on one of the great wooden bridges over the river, I had an
excellent opportunity of observing the negroes of both sexes who were
promenading along the road which passes over these structures: some
thousands of them were out, all dressed in their best, in the height
of fashion&#x2014;negro fashion, of course.  Scores of them passed and
repassed during my stay there, all looking happy and contented.  Some
of the ladies were splendid in rainbow colours, wearing little pink or
emerald-green silk bonnets hanging at the backs of their woolly heads,
and bright orange-coloured shawls, which harmonised nicely with the
skyblue satin ties with huge bows worn by the dark young gentlemen who
were taking their "fair" ones out.  But the great feature was
crinoline; this was worn in quite an original manner, not as useful in
expanding other draperies, but as a thing of beauty in itself.  It was
suspended loosely from the waist and was at least a foot from the
ground, and, having scant drapery over it, it swayed to and fro in a
truly graceful manner, at the same time exhibiting the beautiful feet
of Dinah and the scarlet silk strings with which her shoes were
fastened to them.  One of the happy youths wore a white hat with a
black crape band, his hat stuck on one side of his head in a jaunty
manner, the black band put on as being ornamental; a blue dress-coat
with gilt buttons, a yellow waistcoat, and pants covered with a large
and ornamental pattern.  Some wore the oldest and most threadbare of
finery, but, however old, it was always something that had been fine,
and was worn in that peculiar manner which indicates that the wearer
believes himself or herself to be producing a very powerful
effect.</p>
               <p>On my return to the hotel I found my friend waiting for
me; he had with him the influential person before alluded to, of whom
I felt rather frightened at first, not forgetting what I had heard of
these people's fondness for tarring and feathering.  I liked him
better, however, as our conversation progressed.  He talked much like
other people about slavery; thought it a very dreadful institution;
but, having got it, and all their property embarked with it, it was
not to be supposed they could give everything up at once at the
bidding of New England parsons.  He said that they were quite willing
to discuss the thing in a statesmanlike and businesslike manner, and
adopt such modifications in the system as would eventually place the
negroes in a less degraded, and therefore better, position; but that
the Northerners were continually threatening immediate abolition and
proposing to use force to carry out their views; that they were
determined to meet force by force, and that there was, in consequence,
little chance of peace between them.  He said they had been most
foully slandered by Mrs. Beecher Stowe, that the incidents described
by her as having all actually taken place were picked out of the
events of fifty years, and yet made to appear as though they were
every-day occurrences.  He complained bitterly of the continual
tampering with the negroes, abolitionist newspapers being conveyed
secretly to such as could read, that they might read special articles
to those who could not.  All the persons present evidently thought
that a rising of the slave population against the owners was quite
possible in some of the cities, but that generally the blacks would
stand by their masters.  A gentlemen present from New Orleans said
that he owned about a dozen negroes, chiefly household servants; that
the young ones had been born in his family, and the old ones had known
himself and his wife since childhood [sic] that their affection for
his family was of the strongest possible kind, and they would all look
upon leaving him as the greatest calamity that could befall them; he
would be bound to carry them from New Orleans to Boston and back
without losing one.  Yet, said he, in spite of all this affection for
my wife, my children, and myself, if a rising of the negro population
took place I would not trust one of the them; they would murder us all
in our beds if they could, and then howl in sorrow and misery over the
bodies of their victims; they would blindly, and without reflection,
follow others, doing what they did, and be deeply sorry for it
afterwards.</p>
               <p>As for myself, my new slaveholding friend offered
to show me everything I liked, and guaranteed that I should without
molestation make what notes and sketches I pleased, on condition that
I pledged my word of honour to tell the truth about what I saw, and to
state that fairly and without prejudice, not taking any statements
from other people or attempting to judge of that which I had not an
opportunity of seeing.  I of course promised to do this to the best of
my ability, it being both reasonable and proper.</p>
               <p>A carriage
having been procured we drove into the country, calling at one or two
places to see the negroes in their quarters, and very comfortable
quarters too&#x2014;little cabins of[sic] cottages, several in a row.  The
interiors looked very tidy, and the women and children seemed quite
happy.  They brought me milk and fruit, which appeared to be
abundant.</p>
               <p>The next morning I went out to visit the tobacco
manufactories, and saw the different methods pursued in preparing and
packing the various qualities of tobacco to suit the several markets
it is intended to supply.  In all these establishments negroes of both
sexes and all ages were working, and in some cases singing most
merrily.  I watched narrowly the manner of the negro when called and
questioned by his master.  I did not observe anything like fear on the
negro's part: master and servant seemed to be on friendly terms with
each other, and I do not believe, from what I saw, that these
workpeople were badly treated, generally. </p>
               <p>The auction-rooms
for the sale of negroes are situated in the main streets, and are
generally the ground floors of the building; the entrance-door opens
straight into the street, and the sale-room is similar to any other
auction-room.  I observed that placards, advertisements, and notices
as to the business carried on are dispensed with, the only indications
of the trade being a small red flag hanging from the front door-post,
and a piece of paper upon which is written with pen and ink this
simple announcement&#x2014;"Negroes for sale at auction this day at ten
o'clock," or whatever other time the sale is fixed for.  Besides this
written notice and the heading to a sheet of letter-paper, I saw
nothing in print or writing having reference to the sale of
negroes&#x2014;no catalogues nor descriptions of lots; nor could I find any
advertisements in the local papers.  My friend, having shown me the
entrance to a room where negroes were about to be sold, told me to go
in alone and sit down with the other persons there and look about.  I
accordingly did so, and put on a bold front.  Being a little before
the time fixed for the auction, I had a good opportunity to look at
the crowd of men about me who dealt in human flesh, and I am bound to
say that I saw nothing very dreadful in their appearance; they carried
neither revolvers nor whips.  They were not a gentlemanly-looking lot
of men certainly, but seemed quiet, respectable, [sic] people, such as
one might meet at a sale of books or old china in any part of London.
At length a little bustle occurred at the back of the room, and a
fine-looking coloured man was putforward [sic].  He walked straight up
to the block, mounted it, and put himself in a most dignified
attitude.  The building in which this poor creature was about the be
sold was built either for a mill or a granary; the ceiling was very
low and of great strength, immense beams crossed it transversely, and
the negro's black head stood out well against the great white beam at
the back (for the whole interior was whitewashed) as he stood on the
block evidently making the most of himself with a view of getting his
owner as high a price as possible. He was a remarkably good-looking
man, and although quite black had a finely-formed head; his forehead
was broad and upright, and his features were all good, there being but
little of the common negro type about him.  I felt sure that a
sculptor would have pronounced him by far the best-looking man in the
room.  A few steps lead to the top of the block (which is similar to
those in common use in England for mounting horses), and upon one of
these the auctioneer or crier, as he is called, stands, and a
red-faced, impudent, vulgar-looking individual he was in this case.
The crier, I believe, is not the auctioneer, but a man employed for
the sake of volubility of tongue. To force the biddings, he described
the negro as of such an age, such a height, sound in wind and limb, as
being a good farm hand, could guide a plow, shoe a horse, and mend a
hoe, but he was not a first-rate smith.  Then the biddings commenced,
and 800 dollars were offered.  This sum was mentioned by the
auctioneer, over and over again, as fast as he could utter it until a
higher bid was made; he then took up the fresh bidding and repeated it
in the same manner, hundreds of times, raising his voice each time
until he had got to the top of it.  At the same time he gesticulated
violently, got himself red in the face, and became breathless.  A
higher bidding not coming forth, in spite of his exertions, he told
the negro to get down and walk.  He then stood aside to recover
himself, and the negro paced up and down the room to show that he was
sound on his legs.  Some </p>

stopped him during his walk and asked him a variety of questions, as
to last employment, state of his health, and so forth. Then they
turned his head to the light, and lifted the corners of his eyes, to
ascertain whether they were free from indications of disease; in the
same way they examined his teeth.  They did not do this in a harsh or
brutal manner, but just the same as a doctor might examine a patient.
I did not observe anything like unkindness, much less brutality, in
the way in which the buyers treated the negroes.  The auctioneer had a
couple of negro attendants who waited upon the slaves to be bought and
sold, and I observed that these fellows were much more harsh and
overbearing in their manner than their masters.</p>
               <p>The
auctioneer having recovered himself, the negro remounted the block,
and the bidding went on as before, the crier raising and lowering his
voice and reiterating the bidding so rapidly that it was almost
impossible to hear what he said, working himself up to a pitch of
excitement most extraordinary, which was the more remarkable because
the buyers were all sitting about, smoking and chatting to each other
as quietly as though he were not present, and treating his excitement
and oratorical exertions with the profoundest contempt.  At last the
time arrived when he thought he could get no more biddings.  He said, "If
you have all done," raising his hand in which was a paper.  "Once,
twice!"  His hand did not, however, come down, for somebody bid, and
away went his tongue like a mill, repeating the fresh bidding as
rapidly as before until he again became exhausted.  "Once, twice,
gone!"  The negro was sold for 1500 dols.  Another lot was then
brought forward.</p>
               <p>This was the first human being I had ever
seen sold, and during the time of the biddings I felt the greatest
difficulty in preventing myself from fainting.  A dreadful,
indescribable sickness came over me, which defied all my efforts to
conquer.  I felt giddy, and believe I must have fainted outright had I
not fortunately had a bundle of tobacco strip in my hand.  By smelling
these, and being able to get at some iced water, I got over this my
first visit to a slave auction.  I saw about fifty persons of both
sexes and different ages sold afterwards in this and other
sale-rooms.</p>
               <p>Two or three other persons were sold in this
place&#x2014;among them a pretty little girl and a boy.  Then the buyers
proceeded to another sale-room, of much larger dimensions; and here
scenes similar to those described before took place, the auctioneer
endeavouring to raise the biddings in the same manner.  Several lots
were sold&#x2014;one lot a man and his wife, the wife in bad health.  Some
conditions were attached to this lot&#x2014;they were bound to be taken out
of the State of Virginia.  They were put up twice, and evidently there
was considerable difficulty in disposing of them.  After several
negroes, both male and female, had been disposed of here, the party
again adjourned to another sale-room adjoining.  I observed here a
small apartment at the end of the large room in which a number of
buyers were collected.  There being a window between it and the large
room I was enabled to observe what was taking place there.  I found
that in that apartment the male negroes were stripped, and were being
carefully examined by those who purposed buying.  The negresses are
examined by a female specially appointed for that purpose, and the
negress is sold on the faith of her statement being correct.</p>
               <p>The negroes having been examined, the sale commenced, and was
conducted in the same manner as the others.  One young man was
described as being a good farm-labourer, quite sound, but had one
breast larger than the other.  This man was carefully examined by some
persons sitting beside me, so that I had an opportunity of observing
him closely.  He seemed in no way to feel pain at being sold, but
endeavoured to make himself out as fine a fellow as possible.  On
being asked how often he had the doctor his mouth opened with a grin
from ear to ear, and he replied that he never had a day's illness in
his life.  He was very closely examined, as the buyers evidently
suspected the swollen breast to be cancer.  Another young man was
described as having a switch-mark on his back.  I examined this, but
found it had been inflicted many years before.  It was, however,
looked upon as a blemish, and he fetched a considerable sum less in
consequence.</p>
               <p>A boy about twelve years old was then sold&#x2014;I
think one of the handsomest boys I ever saw, perfect in form, his skin
not black, but a deep brown.  He fetched 750 dollars.  A little girl
was sold previously for 488 dollars.  A very fine, strong, young man
called "Captain" was sold for 1450 dollars.</p>
               <p>Two young women
were also sold, sisters, one with her first child, the child nearly
white.  Both these young women were exceedingly good-looking, the
eldest being about twenty years of age.  They were put on the block
like the others, and were made to walk up and down the room.  The
auctioneer pressed hard for higher biddings in this manner:&#x2014;"I want
to sell this girl if anybody will bid anything like a price.  I wish
particularly to draw your attention to this girl, gentlemen: she is
young, very pretty, and has beautiful teeth."  She was stopped
occasionally, her teeth examined, and then made to take off her shoes
and stockings that her feet might be seen.  The girls laughed and were
very merry over the proceedings, and there was no appearance of
harshness in manner of the people towards these unfortunate creatures.
 It was an every-day occurrence, and thought nothing of by those who
bought and as little of, seemingly, by those who were sold.  But the
scene was one never to be forgotten by me.  These girls fetched about
1300 dollars each.</p>
               <p>The last lot I saw sold was a young man
about nineteen or twenty years of age, with straight hair, not black
but merely dark, not darker than a Spaniard's: he was described as a
good house servant.  I watched this young man attentively, and thought
I saw clearly in his face that he felt deeply the degradation he was
subjected to.  Negroes of courage and ability are by no means scarce
in the Slave States; the position of the negro is often one of trust
and importance, and this brings them in contact with white people of
the better class; from these they naturally learn more than their
masters intend they should know.</p>
               <p>I was much struck with the
quickness and intellect of a negro whom I met in Missouri.  He was in
charge of the bar of an hotel.  I entered into conversation with him
about the condition of the slaves.  He did not charge their owners
with treating them cruelly.  He admitted they were well fed and
clothed, and generally not overworked.  I asked him if he was a slave?
 He stammered, hesitated, was confused; and I saw clearly that I had
asked him an exceedingly rude question.  I felt sorry that I had done
so, as I saw he was hurt and felt the misery of his position.  He
said, "I am not exactly a slave."  I knew he was, but he was ashamed
to own it.  I said to him, "Now, as you admit the slaves to be
tolerably well off, and not to be badly treated generally, are they
contented with their lot, or do they desire to be free?"  On the
bar-counter in front of us were some slops of wine and beer and crumbs
of biscuits: a number of flies were feeding upon them when I asked him
if the slaves were contented with their lot.  He instantly turned a
tumbler glass down upon the counter and two or three of the flies were
imprisoned under it; there was fire in his eye, and his whole body was
agitated as he pointed with his finger to the glass in which the
captured flies were buzzing about.  "Why," said he, "don't those flies
continue to eat and drink as before?  There is plenty there for them,
enough to last them a week, but they will neither eat nor drink; they
have lost their liberty, and without that nothing else is of value."
He lifted the glass, the flies flew away.  "Now," said he, "they are
happy again and will eat and drink, and enjoy what they eat and
drink."  It would be as safe to cram the cellars of their houses with
gunpowder and continue to live over them as to fill the State with men
like these, for certainly they will strike for liberty when they have
a chance.               <hi rend="right">G.H. Andrews</hi></p>

               <p>Virginia steps in
between the seceding States of the Republic and those which are true
to the Union and proposes to mediate.  But her good offices do not
seem to have been very thankfully received by the South, and the North
does not think that there is a case for mediation, and that rebels
should be told to lay down their arms. Moreover, Virginia is not
exactly in the position that gives weight to the interference of a
third party, being herself largely interested in the question; and,
although the circumstance might be thought to increase her zeal, it
might not stimulate her to fair play.  If the South finally separates
and forms a new State (Slaveownia it has been suggested should be its
name) Virginia must go with it.  Mr. Buchanan is not, apparently,
acting with any vigour, and is allowing the South ample time for
arming, drilling, and fortifying; but in one fortnight from this time
Mr. Lincoln takes office, and we shall probably see the loose reins
drawn tight by the strong hand.  Congress is debating, and many very
eloquent speeches are made, but there seems a reluctance to commit the
national council to any very distinct proposition, while the head of
the Government is not likely to act upon the prompting of his
Parliament.  Last Monday was the birthday of Washington, and it will
be interesting to read whether it was remembered&#x2014;and how.</p>
               <p>....It is said that Mr. Cobden has asked Switzerland to interfere
between the Northern and Southern States of the Republic of America,

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi>
principal church of Charleston, South Carolina, is one of the many
examples, architectural or otherwise, of the hold of the mother
country upon the American people.  Not only is the structure built
upon well-known English models, but the very chimes are rung upon
bells cast in England, taken down from one of our own religious
edifices and upreared in the steeple which we have here sketched.  The
tradition amongst the "oldest inhabitants" is that these bells used in
revolutionary times to become objects of contention, and that more
than once they have been brought back to England, to be restored
subsequently in less troublous times.  That the inhabitants of the
pleasant liberally-porticoed houses of the neighbourhood may not hear
them ring the tocsin of civil war is the devout wish of all on this
side of the Atlantic.  Charleston is divided into four wards, and is
governed by a mayor and twelve aldermen.  It is regularly laid out in
parallel streets, and intersected by others at right angles.  The
streets vary in width from thirty-five to seventy feet.  The houses
are neat and elegant, and mostly built of brick.  The streets are
lined with a tree termed the "Pride of India;" while elegant villas,
adorned with verandahs, and surrounded with orange-trees, magnolias,
and palmettos, add much to the elegance and beauty of the city.  Among
the public buildings are the city hall, exchange, courthouse, gaol,
two arsenals, custom-house, theatre, college buildings, and orphan
asylum.  The college, one of the most flourishing institutions of the
Southern States, was founded in 1785, and has a president and six
professors, with (in 1850) seventy students.  The medical college was
founded in 1833, and in 1850 had eight professors and 158 students.
The Literary and Philosophical Society has a fine collection of
objects in natural history, &#x0026;c.; and the Academy of Fine Arts
possesess [sic] some valuable paintings.  The city library contains
about 2400 volumes.</p>

               <p>No progress seems to have
been made towards a compromise of the disputes between the Northern
and the Southern States.  The Peace Convention held by the invitation
of Virginia has commenced its sittings at Washington, but, as it is
with closed doors, the nature of its proceedings is unknown.  North
Carolina has declared that, should the Washington Convention fail in
arranging the difficulties between North and South, she would join her
fortunes with those of the seceders; and Texas has ruled herself out
of the Confederation by a majority of 154 to 6.</p>
               <p>The President
has rejected the ultimatum offered by South Carolina in regard to the
surrender of Fort Sumter, and an attack upon that stronghold was
anticipated.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howell Cobb, lately President Buchanan's
Secretary of the Treasury, has been appointed Secretary of the
Convention of the seceding States, which assembled on the 4th instant,
at Montgomery, in Alabama.  That Convention is engaged in devising a
plan for a confederation of the Southern States; but nothing is yet
known of the results of its labours.</p>
               <p>A very strong Union
feeling is displaying itself in Virginia, and the Convention of that
State is expected to show a large anti-secession majority.</p>
               <p>A
truce has been concluded between the Federal Commander at Fort
Pickens, Pensacola, and the Florida forces. </p>
               <p>On the 31st ult.
Mr. Seward, in an able speech, presented to the Senate the New York
petition favourable to the adoption of resolutions for an adjustment
on the Border States plan. The impression gathered from Mr. Seward's
speech was that the incoming Administration had resolved upon a
coercive policy towards the South should the endeavours for a peaceful
settlement fail.</p>
               <p>Kansas, admitted into the Union but a few
weeks ago, is suffering from the want of the necessaries of life, and
fifty thousand of her people are said to be on the verge of
starvation.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Seven</hi> of the formerly United States are now severed
from the Federal Government, if their own act can achieve this
separation, an issue which Mr. Lincoln is still thought to be inclined
to try, although Mr. Seward's last important speech is conciliatory,
and although discussions tending to the encouragement of a compromise
were pending when the mail left.  It is more than possible that in a
short time Washington may be no longer the seat of the Executive.  The
mediation of Virginia is of a very one-sided character, but she can
hardly be blamed for this when the peculiarity of her position is
taken into account.  We are also informed that it is intended to
defend Fort Sumter against any attack by the Secessionists, and that
new forces are being sent southward by the President.  On the whole,
American news may be thought somewhat more pacific than it had
previously been; for, although the honour of the Federal Government
demands that there shall be no submission to outrage, the fact that so
enormous an aggregation of district demands separation would seem to
make it improbable that coercive measures will be adopted.  Kansas has
come into the Union, with a Constitution that prohibits slavery.  Of
the ulterior views of the seceding States it is premature to speak.

done in the way of settlement at home before extension of jurisdiction
can be thought of.  The new President takes office on Monday week.</p>

               </p>
               <p>.  . . . The power of the landowner over his <pb n="184"/> individual peasants has become all but absolute.  He cannot,
it is true, sell their children, as the whites can do with their
negroes in the Southern States of America.  He cannot separate husband
and wife.  He has never yet sunk into the deep infamy of breeding
slaves for sale. . . . But we cannot conclude these observations
without adverting to the singular coincidence that on the 4th of
March, the day after the emancipation of the serfs in Russia, Mr.
Lincoln, the representative of the national will on the question of
slavery in America, will be inaugurated as President of the United
States.  What an agreement, and yet what a contrast, is thus suggested
by the East and by the West!  In all parts of the world, and under
every modification, forced servitude is felt to be a national curse
wherever it is sanctioned.  And where it has once struck its roots how
difficult it is to eradicate it!  Would that the prospects of
President Lincoln were as bright as are those of the Emperor
Alexander!  The enormity with which the former has to deal is of
deeper hue than that which is about to be crushed by the latter, and
the struggle in the one case is proportionably fiercer than in the
other; but, spite of all appearances to the contrary, spite of
disruption, spite even of civil war, if civil war there should be, we
believe that in America, as in Russia, the rights of humanity will in
the end obtain recognition, and the world, both East and West, will be
compelled to acknowledge that man can have no property in his
fellow-man.</p>

               <p>In accordance
with a provision of the American Constitution, the electoral vote for
President and Vice-President had been formally counted by the
Congressional Committee, in the presence of both the Senate and the
House of Representatives.  Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Hamlin were declared to
be duly elected.  The scene is described to have been very
impressive.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln is on his way to Washington.  At
every town on his route he was received with the most enthusiastic
demonstrations.  During his stay at Indianopolis [sic] he delivered a
Presidential speech, which is believed to be the key to his
Presidential policy.  After admitting that the marching of an army
into South Carolina with hostile intent would be coercion and an act
of invasion, he said:&#x2014; "But if the United States should merely hold
and retake its own forts and other property, and collect the duties on
foreign importations, or even withhold the mails from places where
they were habitually violated, would any or all these things be
'invasion' or 'coercion?' " This indicates an intention on his part to
uphold the Federal authority wherever it has been assailed.  Again, in
another part of his speech, he inferentially denies the right of a
State, any more than of a district or a county, to secede&#x2014;putting his
opinions in the form of questions, which he asks his fellow-citizens
to consider.  This speech, delivered at the present juncture,
undoubtedly possesses great significance.  At Columbus, in Ohio, he
made a speech before the Legislature, in which he said, all that was
wanted was time, patience, and reliance on God. <pb n="185"/>
               </p>
               <p>The Southern Convention, assembled at Montgomery, Alabama, adopted
a Constitution on the 9th.  The title is "The Constitution for the
Provisional Government of the Confederated States of America."  The
preamble reads, "We, the deputies of the sovereign independent States
of South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and
Louisiana, invoking the favour of the Almighty, hereby, in behalf of
the States, ordain and establish this Constitution for a Provisional
Government of the same, to continue one year from the inauguration of
the President, or until a permanent Constitution or Confederation be
put into operation."  The seventh section provides that Congress shall
pass laws effectually preventing the importation of negroes from other
than slaveholding States, also to prohibit the introduction of slaves
from any State not a member of this Confederacy.  The second section
provides that an escaping slave shall be delivered up by the Executive
of the State where found, and for full compensation with expenses in
case of rescue.  The sixth article says that the Government hereby
instituted shall take immediate steps for the settlement of all
matters relating to the public debt and public property at the time of
withdrawal from the United States, these States declaring an earnest
desire to adjust everything pertaining to the common property,
liabilities, and obligations of that Union upon principles of right,
justice, equity, and good faith.  The tariff clause provides that
Congress shall levy and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises
for revenue necessary to carry on the Government, such to be uniform.
The other portions of the Constitution are almost identical with that
of the United States.  The Congress has elected Mr. Jefferson Davis,
of Mississippi, president, and Mr. Alex. H. Stevens, of Georgia,
vice-president.  The above Congress has taken up the question of the
forts and arsenals, and until it issued a formal declaration no
collision was expected to take place, unless commenced by the Federal
Government.  The latter had concentrated large reinforcements of men
and supplies, ready to rush into Charleston harbour.</p>
               <p>The
Virginia State Convention assembled on the 13th ult.; its President
made a union speech, but said that Virginia would insist upon her
rights as a condition of remaining in the confederacy.</p>
               <p>The
Kentucky Legislature, without doing any[t]hing of a national
character, had adjourned to March 20 to await and consider the action
of the Peace Commissioners at Washington.</p>
               <p>The convention at
New Orleans had unanimously adopted a new flag for Louisiana.  It
consists of a yellow star in a red field, with thirteen stripes,
alternate blue, white, and red, emblematic of the origin of the
State&#x2014;France, Spain, and America.  It was hoisted in the convention
amid cheers and plaudits of approval.</p>
               <p>The Texas Convention had
passed an ordinance favouring the formation of a Southern confederacy,
and elected seven delegates to the Southern Congress.</p>
               <p>The
Governor of Georgia accepts the mediation of Virginia, and gives
authentic assurances that Georgia would abstain during the period
contemplated from all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms
between that State and the general Government.</p>
               <p>There is a
report that the British Consul at Mobile or Savannah had been tarred
and feathered, or subjected to some other gross indignity and injury,
but the truth of the rumour seems very doubtful.</p>

President Lincoln will be inaugurated on Monday, and, meantime, has
made a brief and pregnant speech, in which he disclaims the ideas of
"invasion" and "coercion," but has a definite theory as to the right
and duty of the Federal Government to seize its own ports and its own
arsenals, wherever they may happen to be situate.  This intimation
sounds very significantly; and in about a fortnight the arrival of
American mails will be watched with painfully-increased interest.  We,
however, continue to hope that a fratricidal contest may be averted by
the wisdom and forbearance of the new President.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">There</hi> are three forts
in Charleston harbour&#x2014;namely, Castle Pinkney, Fort Moultrie, and Fort
Sumter.  The first two are in possession of the authorities of South
Carolina.  At the time of the outbreak Major Anderson was in command
of Fort Moultrie, with a handful of men, while Fort Sumter, a much
stronger post, and commanding his own, was without defence.  On
Christmas night last Major Anderson spiked his guns, and removed his
men to Fort Sumter, thus securing himself a far stronger position.</p>
               <p>Fort Moultrie is situated on Sullivan's Island, as shown in the
Plan of Charleston Harbour given in our Number for the 9th of February
last.  It is an inclosed water battery, having a front on the south or
water side, of about 300 feet, and a depth of about 240 feet.  It is
built with salient and re-entering angles on all sides, and is
admirably adapted for defence, either from the attack of a storming
party or by regular approaches.  The outer and inner walls are of
brick, capped with stone, and filled in with earth, making a solid
wall fifteen or sixteen feet in thickness.  The work now in progress
consists in cleaning the sand from the walls; ditching it around, and
erecting a glacis; closing up the postern-gates in the east and west
walls; and, instead, cutting sallyports, which lead into strong
outworks on the south-east and south-west angles, in which 12-pounder
howitzer guns will be placed, enabling the garrison to sweep the ditch
on three sides with grape and canister.  The north-west angle of the
fort has also been strengthened by a bastionette, to sustain the
weight of a heavy gun which will command the main street of the
island.  The main entrance has also been better secured, and a
trapdoor, two feet square, cut in the door for ingress and egress.  At
this time the height of wall, from the bottom of the ditch to the top
of the parapet, is twenty feet.  The ditch is from twelve to fifteen
feet wide at the base, and fifteen feet deep.  The nature of the soil
would not seem to admit of this depth being increased, quicksand
having been reached in many places.  The work on the south side is
nearly finished.  The counterscarp is substantially built of plank,
and spread with turf.  The glacis is also finished.  It is composed of
sand, and covered with layers of loam and turf, all of which is firmly
kept in place by the addition of sections of plank nailed to uprights
sunk in the sand and crossing each other at right angles&#x2014;making
squares of about ten feet each.  The purpose of the glacis, which is
an inclined plane, is to expose an attacking party to the fire of the
guns, which are so placed as to sweep it from the crest of the
counterscarp to the edge of the beach.  On the north side all the
wooden gun-cases have been placed close together on the ramparts,
apparently for the purpose of securing it against an escalade, but
possibly as a screen for a battery of heavy guns.  A good many men are
engaged in clearing the ramparts of turf and earth, for the purpose of
putting down a very ugly-looking arrangement, which consists of strips
of plank four inches wide, one inch and a half thick, and six or eight
feet long, sharpened at the point, and nailed down, so as to project
about three feet horizontally from the top of the walls.  A noticeable
fact in the bastionettes is the haste in which one of them has been
built.  The one completed is formed of solid masonry.  In constructing
the other, however, a framework of plank has been substituted. Against
the inside of this wooden outwork loose bricks have been placed.  Both
bastionettes are armed with a small carronade and a howitzer pointed
internally, so as to command the whole intervening moat by a cross
fire.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. Jefferson Davis, President of the Southern Confederacy,
entitled the Confederate States of America, was formally inaugurated
at Montgomery, Alabama, on the 18th ult.  The spectacle is described
as the grandest ever witnessed in the South.  Mr. Davis, in his
address on the occasion said:&#x2014;"The judgment and the will of the
people are that union with the Northern States is neither practicable
nor desirable.  If necessary, we must maintain by final arbitrament of
the sword the position we have assumed."  Unless, therefore, the peace
convention can hit upon an acceptable compromise this final
arbitrament seems inevitable.  The Congress of the seceding Southern
States has declared the navigation of the Mississippi free.  The
appointment of Toombs as Secretary of State, Memminger as Secretary of
the Treasury, and L. Walker as Secretary of War, have been confirmed
by Congress.</p>
               <p>A bill was passed in the Florida Legislature, on
Feb. 16, authorising the issue of Treasury notes to the amount of
500,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>But while the seceding States are
consolidating their new union, the secession movement appears to have
received a check in several of the slaveholding States which have not
yet formally quitted the Confederation founded by Washington.  In
Arkansas and Tennessee, majorities of anti-secession delegates have
been returned, and in Missouri the attempt to convoke a convention has
altogether failed.</p>
               <p>The difficulties between the States of New
York and Georgia are not yet arranged, the governor of the former
refusing to deliver up the arms and ammunition destined for the
seceders, and the authorities of the latter retaining the Northern
ships seized at Savannah in retaliation.</p>
               <p>The committee of the
Washington Peace Conference had reported a plan of pacification,
understood to be compounded from the Crittenden, Guthrie, and Border
States plans.  The Republicans favour the idea of a National
Convention as the best way to settle all trouble, and will attempt to
pass a resolution to that effect.  There has been much hard feeling
and ill blood in the Convention.</p>
               <p>In the House of
Representatives a bill had been reported making an appropriation for a
survey of the Northern Pacific regions, with the view of establishing
a telegraph to Asia.</p>
               <p>The Tariff Bill has been passed in the
Senate.  Not only are its provisions with regard to a large number of
the leading articles of importation absolutely prohibitory, but it is
framed with such intricacy as to render trade almost impossible.</p>
               <p>The Indians were ravaging the territory of New Mexico.  Application
had been made at Washington for troops to assist in suppressing
hostilities.</p>
               <p>The 129th anniversary of the birthday of
Washington was celebrated on the 22nd ult.  The New York papers have
copious accounts of the celebration, and also of the progress of
President Lincoln and of the inauguration of President Davis.</p>
               <p>A telegram from Nebraska City, Kansas, dated the 19th ult.,
says:&#x2014;"Old Fort Kearney was taken possession of last night by a party
of Secessionists, and this morning a Palmetto flag waves over the
fortress, bearing the inscription 'Southern Rights.' "  A later
telegram says:&#x2014;"An attack was made on the fort this morning at ten
o'clock, and, amid great excitement, the Palmetto flag was torn down,
and the stars and stripes raised in its place."</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE FUGITIVE
ANDERSON.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">After</hi> our Supplement,
               containing a portrait of
Anderson and some particulars relating to his release, was at press we
received a copy of the Toronto <title>Globe</title> of the 18th ult.,
which gives a long account of Anderson's early life and his escape
from slavery.  We extract from it the following details:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>John Anderson was born in the year 1831, in Howard county, State of
Missouri.  His mother was the slave of one Burton, a carpenter, who
lived on a small farm near Fayette.  His father, who was almost white,
served as a steward on board a steamer which sailed on the Missouri,
but made his escape to South America while Anderson was yet young.
His mother remained with Burton till Anderson was seven years old,
when she and her master had a quarrel.  Young Anderson was "raised" by
Mrs. Burton, of whom he speaks highly.  He was brought up on the farm,
and in process of time gained such a knowledge of farming that he
undertook its management. When about twenty years of age he was
married to a slave, the property of one Brown, who resided two miles
from Burton's.  After Mrs. Burton's death Burton and Anderson had a
dispute, which ended in his being sold to one M'Donald, who lived in
Glasgow, thirty miles from Fayette.  Being thus separated from his
wife, Anderson was much discontented, and from this time he watched
for an opportunity to make his escape to Canada.</p>
               <p>In
September, 1853, when he had been about two months with M'Donald, he
made his escape.  M'Donald was at the church, investigating a case of
a slave having been whipped to death, when Anderson rode off on one of
his master's mules to a branch of the Missouri, at a point where there
was a ferry.  The ferryman, being under orders to prevent all slaves
who had no passes from crossing, asked Anderson for his pass.
Anderson replied that he did not require one, but the ferryman would
not allow him to go over.  Riding back into the woods, he remained
there till it was evening, when he returned to the river.  He was on
the point of seizing a boat that was lying on the bank when, some one
appearing, he was compelled again to retreat into the woods, where he
lay till within two hours of daybreak.  He then ventured once more to
the bank, and found a skiff without oars lying by the river.  He
supplied himself with a piece of bark, and, using this as a paddle,
got across the stream.  He then repaired to the house of his
father-in-law, who was a free man and a barber by trade, and from him
obtained some refreshment.  He next visited his wife and child, and,
affectionately bidding them farewell, went on his way, determined to
obtain his freedom.</p>
               <p>It was about noon on the second day after
his leaving M'Donald that a man named Digges met him and asked him for
his pass.  When Anderson said he had no pass Digges with his slaves
chased him, and in the conflict that ensued Digges was wounded and
Anderson escaped uninjured.  About a week after his adventure with
Digges Anderson found shelter for the night in a barn, where he met a
coloured boy, from whom he purchased some provisions.  Anderson
usually travelled by night, and got what rest he could by day.  He
suffered much from want of food, sometimes not tasting any for several
days, and often he had to content himself with corn, hazel nuts,
pawpaws, or raw potatoes.  A dollar and a half was all the money he
had when he started on his perilous journey, and of this he never
spent any except when compelled to do so by extreme hunger.  One day
while resting himself by the wayside a man on horseback rode up and
attempted to capture him, but Anderson fled to a neighbouring field
and found protection among the stalks of corn.</p>
               <p>Impelled by
necessity to resort to any expedient to satisfy the cravings of
hunger, he one day entered a farm-house by the kitchen door, and
finding some salt that was at hand he put it in his pocket and walked
out, meeting none of the inmates.  He next came to a farm-yard, where
he captured three chickens, and then repaired to the woods that were
close by.  Lighting a fire, he cooked two of them, but had scarcely
finished the second when he heard some footsteps, and thinking that
the owner of the chickens was in pursuit of him he made his way out of
the woods with the other chicken in his hand as soon as possible.
This chicken served him for two days.  Near Mississippi village he met
with a coloured man, and gave him ten cents to buy some crackers for
him.  This man, after some delay, brought him the crackers, which he
greedily devoured.  He crossed the Mississippi by night, using for
that purpose a boat which he found, and keeping clear of the ferry for
fear of detection.</p>
               <p>It was now Saturday night, and about two
weeks since he had left M'Donald; and he had reached the Free State of
Illinois; but, from the attempts made to capture him in this State, he
was convinced that he was almost in as much danger there as he had
been in Missouri.  On Sunday night he went into the house of a white
man, an Englishman, who gave him a good supper and a bed.  Having on
the following morning got breakfast, and the good-hearted Englishman
having prevailed on him to take some bread and apples in his pocket,
John again set out with renewed strength and spirits.  He soon met
some men on horseback, who asked him for his pass, but he pretended to
be free.  The men, disbelieving him, pursued; but Anderson was too
expert for them and made his escape to a hill.  In the evening he
found himself by a small river.  Seeing a dog some distance before him
he retreated into the woods and struck another river.  He there
observed a boat crossing, but, being afraid that his liberty might be
endangered if he attempted to pass that way, he went back into the
bush.  Having by this time consumed what the Englishman had given him,
and having a keen appetite, he made an attempt to capture some
chickens, but was unsuccessful.  He came upon a white man's house,
into which he entered, pretending to have lost his way.  Here he got
his breakfast and bought a loaf of bread from the housewife for ten
cents.  The farmer promised to direct him, but when they were a few
yards from the house, Anderson, perceiving the man was leading him
back and seeing his sons some distance before him, took to flight.</p>
               <p>After two days he struck a branch of the Illinois River, which he
crossed, and, proceeding some distance, came to a railway track, with
the use of which he was acquainted.  He next came to Bloomington,
where he obtained some provisions.  He availed himself of the railway
track for a short distance north of Bloomington. Confused and
bewildered, he met a man who promised him a ride if he would help him
with his cow.  At this man's house he got a supper and a bed, and
started the next morning before breakfast.  Through some villages
which he passed every one looked on him as a curiosity on account of
his travel-stained condition&#x2014;the children running to the doors to
stare at him.  Overtaking some teams that were on the road to Rock
Island, he got on one of them and reached that city by daylight. Here
he hired himself to a barber, though he was quite uninstructed in the
art of shaving.  Remaining in that city two days, he went to Chicago,
the Abolition Society paying his fare.  In Chicago he lived with a
barber for three weeks, when he left for Windsor, being advised by his
master to do so.</p>
               <p>It was about the beginning of November,
1853, when he reached Windsor, about six weeks after he had made his
escape from his master in Missouri.  During his stay in Windsor, where
he got employed as a labourer, he wrote twice to his wife.  He worked
as a plasterer at Hamilton and Caledonia, and at the time of his
arrest, by Mathews, was engaged making maple sugar.  After being
discharged he went to Simcoe, where he was again arrested and brought
before Mathews.  Anderson says "he never knew that there was <hi rend="italic">so much
law</hi> in the world as he has found in Canada."</p>

               <p>. . . Mr. President Lincoln was, doubtless,
inaugurated last Monday, and strong anxiety is felt for news as to the
course he will adopt in regard to the South. Mr. Jefferson Davis, the
President of the Southern Confederation, has taken office, and has
lost no time in proclaiming that there must be no idea of a reunion,
and that the sword must be resorted to should there be any attempt to
reimpose the Federal yoke.  This language is, doubtless, explicit
enough.  In what way Mr. Lincoln intends to carry out his idea of
avoiding invasion and coercion, and yet of seizing back any Federal
property on which the Secessionists have laid hands, is a problem for
whose solution we shall wait with impatience.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">At</hi>
Toronto the fugitive slave, John Anderson, claimed by the United
States' Government, on the charge of murdering one Seneca P. Digges,
in the State of Missouri, in the year 1853, while making his escape
from slavery, and whose extradition to the Missouri authorities was on
the 15th of December last ordered by the Canadian Court of Queen's
Bench, was, on the 9th ult., brought before the Court of Common Pleas,
on a writ of habeas corpus issued by Chief Justice Draper.  The
proceedings are reported at great length.  The points urged on behalf
of the prisoner are these.  First, that the prisoner was entitled to
the writ on which he was brought before the Court, and upon the return
to that writ to have inquired into the matters charged against him.
Second, that the evidence was not sufficient to put him upon his trial
for the crime of murder, assuming that he was entitled to the
protection of British law. Third, that the treaty requires that a
charge under it should be first laid in the States, and that the
evidence did not show that any charge had been laid against the
prisoner.  Fourth, that even if we are bound to administer this law of
Missouri, the evidence did not show that this state of Missouri had
any power to pass such a law, and it cannot be presumed that she had
that power, inasmuch as she is but a municipality in relation to other
Governments, and the law is against natural justice.  Fifth, that the
word "murder" mentioned in the treaty means murder according to the
laws of both countries; and, if not, that by the treaty itself and our
statute the crime charged is to be determined by the laws of
Canada&#x2014;that it is the criminality that is to be determined by the
laws of Canada.  After hearing the evidence, Chief Justice Draper said
that the Court desired to dispose of this case as quickly as possible,
so that Anderson might not be kept in custody any longer than was
necessary, if the decision went in his favour; but it was questionable
whether, if judgment was to be given on all the points involved, the
case could be decided during the present term.  At all events they
would give the prisoner the benefit of a speedy discharge if they came
to an opinion in his favour on the technical point as to the
insufficiency of the commitment.  On this question they would probably
be able to give a decision that day week&#x2014;the last day of term.  An
order would be made for the prisoner to be brought up next Saturday,
and in the meantime he would be committed to the custody of the
Sheriffs of the united counties of York and Peel.</p>
               <p>On
Saturday, the 16th ult., the Court of Common Pleas, as was generally
anticipated, discharged Anderson, on the grounds that the warrant of
commitment was not issued in conformity with the statute,
because&#x2014;1st. It did not contain a charge of murder, but merely of
felonious homicide; whereas the treaty and our statute do not
authorise a surrender, and, consequently, not a committal for the
purpose of surrender, for any homicide not expressed to be murder.
2nd.  That it was not expressed to be for the purpose of surrender,
but only until the prisoner should be discharged by due course of
law&#x2014;whereas the statute requires both.  Upon the merits of the
question itself no judgment was given.</p>
               <p>The following extract
from Chief Justice Draper's judgment will show what he thought of the
case:&#x2014;"I have, so far as the limited time and the pressure of the
business during the week would permit, considered some of the
questions involved.  I have at least been able to appreciate the
difficulty of disposing of them.  One doubt arises on the threshold,
namely, whether the statute gives the Court power to look into the
depositions and to adjudge whether they contain evidence of
criminality sufficient to sustain the charge of murder.  It is easy to
suggest objections to the placing the power of exclusive and final
adjudication on this point in the hands of a single Justice, even
although his decision is not binding on the Government, to whom he
must certify the same and the evidence, and on whom rests the ultimate
responsibility of surrendering or refusing to surrender the prisoner.
Still, however weighty I might deem such objections, if the statute
does confer that jurisdiction on a single Judge or Justice of the
Peace, the statute must be obeyed.  And I am free to confess that
there is some difficulty in affirming this Court can review the
decision of the Judge or Justice without running counter to the
opinion expressed in <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> Besset.  But
conceding that we have that province, and as a necessary incident to
it to bring the depositions before us by <hi rend="italic">certiorari</hi> (as to which some technical objections
may be suggested), I require further time before I can adopt as a
principle of the law, that because a man is a slave in a country where
slavery is legalised he is legally incapable of committing a crime,
that he is not to be deemed a "prisoner" who may be charged with an
offence.  Nor am I prepared to decide that on a charge of murder,
sufficiently sustained by evidence to warrant his being committed for
trial according to our law, the prisoner accused of that crime would
not be within the meaning of the treaty because, if acquitted on a
trial in the country where the accusation arose, he would be detained
in bondage as a slave, or because it might be feared, and even with
reason feared, that because he was a slave he would not be treated in
the same spirit of justice and impartiality as a freeman before the
tribunals of a foreign State where slavery is established by local
law.  Or, to take a possible case to arise in a Free State, let it be
supposed that a slave flies from a Slave State into a Free State,
whose laws, nevertheless, unlike our own happy institutions, sanction
and require his surrender merely as a slave&#x2014;that the fugitive kills
an officer of the Free State who is endeavouring, under regular
process, to arrest and detain him with a view to his surrender, and,
having killed the officer, escapes into this province, I do not yet
see any way to the conclusion that we could hold the case not to be
within the treaty, and the act so clearly not to be murder, that there
would be nothing for a jury to try, but that the Court could dispose
of it as a pure question of law.  For if there be a question of fact
to be tried, I apprehend he must be surrendered, as such question
could only be tried in the country where the fact arose.  These and
other similar questions are of too serious a character to be decided
upon impulse or in haste, and I do not scruple to say that, so long as
the prisoner sustains no prejudice by the delay, I desire to defer
pronouncing an opinion upon them.  I am reluctant on the one hand
where the accuser does not make it indispensable to declare that each
individual of the assumed number of 4,000,000 of slaves in the
Southern States may commit assassination in aid of his escape on any
part of his route to this province, and find impunity and shelter on
his arrival here.  I am reluctant on the other hand to admit that
Great Britain has entered into treaty obligations to surrender a
fugitive slave who, as his sole means of obtaining liberty, has shed
the blood of the merciless taskmaster who held him bondage.  An
occasion may arise when it will be my duty to adjudge one way or the
other.  But the necessity does not exist at present, and I am not
afraid to avow that I rejoice at it.  I am, however, glad that the
discussion has taken place, that the doubts and difficulties it
suggests have been brought prominently forward.  The power of dealing
with them is in the hands of others, and the necessity of dealing with
them must, I think, be felt by those who possess the power."</p>
               <p>As the facts of the Anderson case may have escaped the memory of
some of our readers we briefly recapitulate them.  John Anderson, a
negro slave, but with apparently a mixture of white blood in his
veins, was brought up in the State of Missouri, and married a slave
girl, by whom he had one child. Sharing the lot of his master's other
live stock, he was sold into a part of the country many miles away
from his wife.  In the year 1853 he fled from the plantation to which
he was transferred, and appeared in the quarter where his wife was
located.  Here he was descried by a planter named Seneca Digges, who
had no claim over him, but who, in the common interest of
slaveholding, gave chase with four slaves, whom he placed on the track
of the fugitive.  They ran down Anderson, as though he had been a mad
dog, and Digges at last closed with him.  Anderson, thus brought to
bay, stabbed Digges mortally.  He then made his way to Canada, where
he has ever since lived the life of a quiet, industrious citizen.  The
wife and child of Anderson are still in bondage in Missouri, and he is
most anxious to purchase their freedom.  This object might easily be
effected by a public subscription.  Will some public-spirited
individual stir in the matter?</p>
               <p>Our Portrait is from a
painting in oil, life-size, taken by Mr. James Forbes, of Toronto,
whilst Anderson lay in the Toronto gaol.</p>

THE UNITED STATES.
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Lincoln reached Washington on the 24th ult.,
having hastened his departure from Harrisburg by a special night train
in consequence of information said to have been received of a plot to
assassinate him.  The report was of doubtful origin.  It is probable
that he hastened forward to escape the mob at Baltimore. The President
elect had been waited upon by Lord Lyons and other foreign Ministers
on the 25th.  General Scott, Mr. Seward, and several prominent
Republican senators were closeted with him concerning the ceremonies
connected with the inauguration.  At a general lev&#x00E9;e given by Mr.
Lincoln several hundred gentlemen from all sections of the country
paid their respects to him.  Mr. Lincoln visited the Senate and House
of Representatives, and was well received.  The authorities at
Washington on the 27th formally took leave of President Buchanan, and
then extended a formal welcome to the President elect. Mr. Lincoln in
his speech spoke in the most fraternal manner towards the citizens of
the slave-owning States.</p>
               <p>Despatches from Washington state
that the following is a list of the Cabinet officers of the incoming
Administration, which has been virtually adopted as a compromise
between the contesting sections, factions, and cliques of the
Republican party:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>Secretary of State	. . .	W.H. Seward,
of New York.   <lb/>Secretary of Treasury	. . . 	Salmon P.
Chase, of Ohio.   <lb/>Secretary of War	. . . 	Simon Cameron, of
Pennsylvania.   <lb/>Secretary of Navy	. . .	Montgomery Blair, of
Indiana.   <lb/>Secretary of the Interior	. . .	Caleb B.
Smith, of Indiana. <lb/>Postmaster-General	. . .	Gideon Willes,
of Connecticut. <lb/>Attorney-General	. . .	Edward Bates, of
Missouri.</p>
               <p>The Peace Conference at Washington had dispersed,
after having agreed to recommend a compromise prohibiting slavery in
the United States' territories north of 36 deg. 30 m., allowing and
protecting it in the territories south of that line, and providing
that new States shall be admitted into the Union with or without
slavery, according to the desire of their inhabitants.  The proposed
compromise further forbids the acquisition of fresh territory without
the assent of majorities of the slaveholding and non-slaveholding
States, deprives Congress of all right to abolish slavery in the
district of Columbia without the assent of Maryland, stipulates the
free passage of slaves from one slaveholding State to another, and
prohibits the African slave trade. These proposals had been submitted
for the consideration of the Senate, which had referred them to a
committee of five senators.  It was thought that the incoming
Administration and the House of Representatives were disposed to make
considerable concessions with a view to conciliate the
Southerners.</p>
               <p>The Senate had finally passed the Tariff Bill,
which awaited the President's assent.</p>
               <p>The Senate and House of
Representatives had postponed further action upon the Coercion Bills,
and legislative and other action was evidently suspended until the
inauguration of the new President.</p>
               <p>In the House the report of
the Committee of thirty-three on the crisis was taken up.  The clause
providing for the admission of New Mexico into the Union, with or
without slavery, as her people may elect, was laid on the table by a
vote of 114 to 71.  A motion was made to suspend the rules, in order
to take up the proposition of the Peace Congress.  On taking a vote,
the motion was rejected by 92 to 66-two-thirds not voting for the
motion.  The Nevada and Dacotah [sic] Territorial bills were passed.
The amendment to the Act for the Rendition of Fugitive Slaves was
passed.  The amendment to the Act for the Rendition of Fugitives from
Justice was rejected by a vote of 162 to 47.</p>
               <p>The election in
North Carolina had gone in favour of union by a small majority.</p>
               <p>General Twigg had been struck off the army roll as a coward and a
traitor for having surrendered the Federal military property in Texas
to the State authorities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE
CONFEDERATE STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the <title>New York
Herald</title> Mr. Jefferson Davis, the President of the new Southern
Confederacy, is "making every preparation for bloody contest," and
"all hope of an adjustment is passed."  There were rumours that Fort
Sumter was to be attacked by the South Carolinians immediately after
the 4th of March.</p>
               <p>The Southern Congress at Montgomery has given
instructions to the Finance Committee to consider the expediency of
laying an export duty on cotton.</p>
               <p>The new Tariff Act adopted
by the Congress enacts that all kinds of provisions, agricultural
productions in their natural state, and munitions of war, are exempt
from duty.</p>
               <p>A circular from the collector of the port of
Charleston gives notice that all vessels from States not members of
the Confederate States will, from and after the 22nd of February, be
regarded as foreign vessels, and as such must enter, clear, pay fees,
and comply with all the laws and regulations in force on the 1st of
November last.</p>
               <p>According to some accounts, the State of South
Carolina, or rather the very South Carolinian part of it, grows
restive under the new Confederation.  They complain that they are to
be saddled with a tariff, and that the slave trade is to be
prohibited.  In Mississippi there is already discontent at the great
taxation necessary to support the new state of things.  The ordinary
taxes have been doubled, and a heavy loan is proposed, to anticipate
future levies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>. . . That
the American journals should lend any credence to the tale that the
disaffected Southerners had actually planned the assassination of the
new President shows to what a pitch party feelings have been brought
in the Republic.  In the absence of further evidence we are reluctant
to believe in the story of the infernal machine said to have been
found in the railway-car in which Mr. Lincoln travelled, but it is
certain that the President finished his journey to Washington with a
rapidity originally unintended, and without making his friends aware
of his movements.  To read of the President's wife in tears, and
urging her husband to depart suddenly, seems like turning back the
page of history for a couple of hundred years.  If we rightly
understand his act it was a wise precaution to prevent any popular
disturbance, and no man on either side the Atlantic will question the
courage of Abraham Lincoln. Mr. Douglas, his most formidable
antagonist, has had an interview with him, and, it is said, urged him
to decide upon a pacific course; but Mr. Lincoln is too wary a man to
fall into any trap, and made the same sort of answer that Lord
Palmerston would give under such circumstances, namely&#x2014;that the
question was under his best consideration.  But news of the
inauguration will, in all probability, arrive in time to be found in
another column.  Meantime the latest news is of the alarmist
character, and speaks of the President's intention to reinforce Fort
Sumter, and collect the dues by means of war-vessels, while the
leading New York journal says that all hope of adjustment has passed,
and the South is preparing for battle.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Since</hi> we
gave, a few weeks ago, a portrait of Mr. Lincoln, the President elect
of the United States, one startling event has followed another in that
country in sufficiently rapid succession to take away the breath from
even the most go-ahead of our Transatlantic cousins.  His election,
like a firebrand thrown into combustible materials, set the South in a
blaze.  First South Carolina seceded from the Union, followed quickly
by Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.
These States proceeded forthwith to form themselves into a new Union,
called the Confederate States of America; and on the 18th ult.  Mr.
Davis (whose Portrait we give on our first page) was inaugurated at
Montgomery, Alabama, President of the Southern Confederacy.  We gather
from the American papers some particulars of his life, though is it
difficult, owing to the sway of party spirit at the present time in
the States, to get an unbiased account of any one of their public men.
 General Davis first made himself conspicuous when a young man as a
strong and unyielding advocate of the repudiation of her bonds by the
State of Mississippi.  He was sent to the United States' House of
Representatives, and then to the National Senate, by the grateful
Mississippians.  When the Mexican war was begun he left Congress, and
took an active part in the contest, being much superior to most of the
leading volunteers of those times, as he was a trained soldier, having
been educated at West Point, and having served in the regular army. He
distinguished himself particularly at Buena Vista, under General
Taylor, whose son-in-law he was.  When Pierce was made President, in
1853, General Davis was appointed Secretary of War, and was the most
powerful member of the Administration, ruling the President and also
most of the members of the Cabinet.  The only man who managed to keep
tolerably independent of him was Secretary Marcy, who was at the head
of the State department, and who kept his attention principally
directed to foreign affairs.  The Pro-Slavery policy of the Pierce
Administration was due to Davis's character and conduct.  He went out
of the Cabinet when Mr. Buchanan became President, and was elected to
the Senate by the Legislature of Mississippi, and held the office
until he recently left it on the secession of his State.  Elected
President of the new Confederacy, his success in that way is supposed
to indicate the ascendancy of moderate ideas among the Confederates,
some of whom are understood to be quite willing to return into the
Union.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi>
give on the preceding page a Portrait of General Winfield Scott, who,
as Commander-in-Chief of the United States' forces, necessarily
occupies at the present juncture a commanding position in American
affairs&#x2014;second only, indeed, to that of the new President.  His
personal character also ranks exceedingly high; and the utmost
confidence appears to be reposed in the prudence as well as in the
firmness of the General by his countrymen in the Northern States.  A
New England journal, treating of General Scott's character and
exploits, bursts into the following panegyric:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>"Every
American heart beats proudly at the name of General Winfield Scott&#x2014;so
brave in the field, so wise in council, so true a patriot, and so
loyal to the Constitution and the Union.  At the moment when it has
become fashionable for American citizens to turn traitors to the
Republic which their fathers built up with their blood&#x2014;when State
after State 'secedes' from the Union as if our great and majestic
nationality were a mere trade partnership without law and without
authority&#x2014;when rebels seize the Federal forts and fire upon Federal
troops, and obsequious Federal officers fire no gun to avenge the
outrage&#x2014;when base and sordid manufacturers here in our very midst, in
the stronghold of the liberty, and intellect, and virtue of the
country, traitorously send arms and ammunition for the support of the
revolted States, arms designed to be used against ourselves, against
all who oppose, in the name of God and the United  States, their
traitorous plans and ambitions&#x2014;at this great moment of distraction
and peril all eyes are turned to the soldier of the Commonwealth as its
sure hope and stay&#x2014;an unbribable, honest soldier, who is quick to see
and prompt to act, and with the courage of a lion in him.  We trust
that his military services may never be required in defence of the
Union against rebel citizens or States; for he knows too well&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">all</hi> too well&#x2014;what civil war means, and what
frightful horrors it inaugurates.  But if it should ever be necessary
to defend the capital of the country against an enemy, whether native
or foreign, here is the man&#x2014;American to the backbone of him, and true
as steel to the cause of human liberty&#x2014;who will do it or die.</p>
               <p>"General Scott's history is well known, and the part he played in
the great drama of 1812 and in the Mexican war was only equalled by
the greatest Generals of ancient and modern times.</p>
               <p>"Dr.
Channing thus speaks of his Indian mission to the Cherokees, in
1838:&#x2014;'To this distinguished man belongs the rare honour of uniting
with military energy and daring the spirit of a philanthropist.  His
exploits in the field, which have placed him in the first rank of our
soldiers, have been obscured by the purer and more lasting glory of a
pacificator and of a friend of mankind.  In the whole history of the
intercourse of civilised with barbarous or half-civilised communities
we doubt whether a brighter page can be found than that which records
his agency in the removal of the Cherokees.  In his recent mission to
the disturbed borders of our country he has succeeded not so much by
policy as by the nobleness and generosity of his character, by moral
influences, by the earnest conviction with which he has enforced on
all with whom he had to do the obligations of patriotism, justice,
humanity, and religion.  It would not be easy to find among us a man
who has won a purer fame.  And I am happy to offer this tribute
because I would do something, no matter how little, to hasten the time
when the spirit of Christian humanity shall be accounted an essential
attribute and the brightest ornament of a public man.'</p>
               <p>"In
November, 1846, he sailed for Brazos San Jago, to superintend the
expedition against Vera Cruz.  The object of obtaining Vera Cruz was
the establishment of a shorter route to the city of Mexico.  His
modesty and unpresuming disposition made him refuse the offer of the
Secretaryship of War, after the ratification of peace in 1815.  He
accepted, however, a diplomatic mission to Europe, in the service of
his country, and received for his admirable execution of it the thanks
of the President.  On his return he took the seaboard command, making
his head-quarters in New York.  In March, 1817, he married Miss Maria
Mayo, daughter of John Mayo, Esq., of Richmond, Virginia.  During the
last twenty years he has lived in comparative seclusion, although as
Commander-in-Chief of the American forces he has had plenty of
employment.  His activity at the present time, and his anxiety to
prevent a war between the North and South, the firm resolve to be
prepared for it, and to devote his last days as well as his early
years to his country's service, to maintain its honour and dignity
both at home and abroad, have met with the approval and gratitude of
every American citizen who cares more for his country than for his
party."</p>

Illustration, taken on the road from Atlanta to La Grange, in the
former State, represents only a specimen of its order.  The traveller
from Charleston to Montgomery, as he jolts and thunders over the
single track, will pass scores of these primeval Doric structures,
isolated in some black swamp, where the protruding, charred pine
stumps alone remind him of the forest long since felled by that brave
old woodman, Caloric.  As the train approaches the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t a person
rushes from somewhere with a blazing pineknot, which he brandishes
high in air.  This dab of lurid light is the Southern substitute for
all the complicated apparatus of red and green bulls-eyes, signs,
signals, poles, guards, breakmen [sic], switchmen, and watchmen to be
met with on a European railway.</p>

                  THE UNITED STATES.
               </p>
               <p>The ceremony of Mr. Lincoln's inauguration as
President of the United States took place on the 4th inst. at
Washington.  The congregation on and before the east front of the
Capitol was immense&#x2014;larger, it is said, than was ever known before.
Senator Baker, of Oregon, introduced Mr. Lincoln to the assembly.  On
Mr. Lincoln advancing to the stand he was cheered, though not
vehemently.  Unfolding his manuscript, he read his inaugural speech,
which is given in full at page 272 of our Supplement.  At the
conclusion of the address Chief Justice Taney administered to him the
oath of office as follows:&#x2014;"I, Abraham Lincoln, do solemnly swear
that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United
States, and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and
defend the Constitution of the United States."</p>
               <p>President
Lincoln had nominated the following gentlemen as his Cabinet:&#x2014;William
H. Seward, of New York, Secretary of State; Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio,
Secretary of the Treasury; Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania, Secretary
of War; Gideon Welles, of Connecticut, Secretary of the Navy; Caleb B.
Smith, of Indiana, Secretary of the Interior; Montgomery Blair, of
Maryland, Postmaster-General; Edward Bates, of Missouri,
Attorney-General.  The nomination of this Cabinet was confirmed by the
United States' Senate on the 5th of March.</p>
               <p>It is asserted
that President Lincoln and his Cabinet have resolved to throw
reinforcements into Fort Sumter, General Scott being of opinion that
such a measure can be easily executed.</p>
               <p>The labours of the
thirty-sixth Congress ended on the 4th inst. at noon.  The Senate
signalised its last hours by the passage of the resolution
recommending an amendment to the Constitution rendering it unalterable
in respect to the power of the people to so amend it as to disturb
slavery as it exists in the States except by the consent of all the
States where slavery prevails.  No business of importance was
transacted in the House.</p>
               <p>The new Tariff Act was signed by
President Buchanan on the 2nd inst., and will come into operation on
April 1.</p>
               <p>Arkansas has elected a majority of Unionists.  North
Carolina had elected sixty-five Unionists and thirty-three
Secessionists.  Missouri has declined to secede.  Virginia is on the
point of secession, the State Convention having passed an ordinance
"dissolving the political connection between Virginia and the Northern
States of the Union."</p>
               <p>All the United States' ships now in the
Pacific and Mediterranean have been ordered home to northern ports.
All the troops now in Mexico and Texas have also been recalled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Lyons
has notified to the Washington Government that the British Government
will not recognise the blockade of the southern ports unless such
blockade be complete and effectual. It was stated that the French
Government would shortly give a similar notice, and that this course
would be followed by the leading European Powers interested.</p>
               <p>The Southern Congress has passed a bill providing for the formation
of an army which will, it is said, be composed of 50,000 men.</p>
               <p>The Southern Commissioners have arrived at Washington, and were,
according to one account, to communicate the object of their mission
to President Lincoln on Tuesday, the 12th inst.; whilst, according to
another rumour, they could not be recognised at Washington.</p>
               <p>The Louisiana Convention has passed an ordinance transferring to
the Southern Government the sum of 536,000 dollars from the amount of
customs moneys seized at New Orleans.</p>
               <p>General Beauregard has
been dispatched by the Southern Government to take the command of
Charleston.  He has expressed his confidence that Fort Sumter would be
reduced.</p>
               <p>The Governor of Georgia has released the barque
Adjuster, which he recently seized.</p>
               <p>The Texan State troops
were contemplating an attack on Fort Brown.  The revenue-cutter Dodge
had been seized by the authorities of Texas in Galveston Bay.  The
second officer in command resigned, and tendered his services to the
Governor.</p>
               <p>The following is the Cabinet of the Southern
Confederacy as at present constituted:&#x2014;Secretary of State, Robert
Toombs, of Georgia; Secretary of the Treasury, C.L. Memminger, of
South Carolina; Secretary of War, Leroy P. Walker, of Alabama;
Secretary of the Navy, Stephen M. Mallory, of Florida;
Postmaster-General, John H. Reagan, of Texas; Attorney-General, Judah
P. Benjamin, of Louisiana.</p>

no other interest were involved in the present condition of the United
States of America than that which attaches to the dramatic spectacle
of a nation divided against itself, the inaugural speech of the new
President would have been scanned with the deepest attention.  But it
is to be hoped that we in England are influenced by higher feelings
than mere curiosity when we contemplate the prospect of an internecine
struggle between two sections of a people derived from ourselves, and
with whom every recent year has tended to strengthen all those bonds
which are forged by community of interests, commercial intercourse,
and mutual respect. The speech of Mr. Lincoln at Washington must be
considered in all its bearings, and examined in connection with all
the difficulties by which he is surrounded, while a judgment is being
formed with regard to it.  That every effort has been made to invest
that Address with a tone of moderation is evident enough; but in its
most important declarations it is equally clear and emphatic.  It lays
down a determination to preserve the inviolability of the Union, and
it as decidedly pronounces against the acts and the resolutions of the
Southern States.  No words can well be stronger than those in which he
states that "the power confided to him shall be used to hold, occupy,
and to possess property and places belonging to the Government, and to
collect the duties imposed.  Beyond what is necessary for these
objects there will be no invasion or force."  This is undoubtedly
committing the Executive to a course of hostilities if that course
should be found necessary to the maintenance of the Union.  Assuming
that Mr. Lincoln has entered on his office with the opinion that the
first duty of the President is to maintain the Union, it is not easy
to say how he could say less; but it is also certain that such a
declaration must inevitably bring matters to such a point that one
party or the other must yield if a hostile collision is to be avoided.
As far as can be seen, there is little prospect that the Southerners
will give way in this the first flush of what may be called their
success; and it is probable that all that is needed now towards
letting slip the dogs of war is the shedding of the first blood.  As
in more than one place the Federal troops are threatened with attack,
this event will probably not be long delayed.  As regards what may be
termed the conciliatory part of Mr. Lincoln's speech, it urges on the
citizens of the States that the triumph of the principles which are
represented by his election does not militate against the enjoyment of
peace, property, and personal security on the part of those who are
his political opponents; and he reiterates that which he has said on
former occasions&#x2014;namely, that he has no purpose, directly or
indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in States
where it exists.  The most sanguine Abolitionist did not think that
the time had arrived for an emancipation of the slaves, so that this
declaration is not likely to be taken for much.  There is one
concession, however, which may cause surprise in those who are not
aware that some time since an opinion to that effect was uttered by
Mr. Lincoln.  He states that he is not unwilling to grant a more
effectual Fugitive Slave Law than now exists.  It would seem as if
this was intended to intimate that, so long as the existence of
slavery is acknowledged as an institution, all the concomitant
circumstances which are supposed to be necessary to its safe enjoyment
and preservation are to be held not merely as privileges but as
rights.  How far this may be thought to be in strict conformity with
the doctrine of the Republican party it is not for us to say, but it
is by no means certain that it will be accepted as any great boon by
the South.  For all immediate purposes it is most likely that this
Address will be received as satisfactory to the North.  It pledges the
President to the solidarity of the Union, and it offers terms to those
who are seeking to dissolve a federation which, with all its
anomalies, has produced in an incredibly short space of time a great
nation which is the admiration, and in many respects the envy, of the
world.  It would, however, be simply the result of judicial blindness
if we were to yield to the belief that the danger of an armed contest
has passed away.  With that remarkable facility for organisation which
the Americans possess, a new Republic has sprung up full-grown in the
South, and the same spirit which led the Western colonists of England
to brave her power will doubtless stimulate the seceding States to try
the last conclusions with the strength of the North, backed as it is
by the accessories and the prestige of that which is still called the
Federal Government proper.  Mr. Lincoln states that in the hands of
his dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in his, is the momentous
issue of civil war; his Government will not assail them, so that they
can have no conflict without being themselves the aggressors.  It is
believed that even this is a responsibility from which the South will
not shrink; and all that the well-wishers of peace and goodwill among
fellow-citizens and men of the same race and nation can do is to hope
that all the horrors and all the scandal of such a strife may yet be
averted.  That this is a hope against hope we are grieved to say that
we cannot deny.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE CROWD WAITING FOR MR.
LINCOLN AT BALTIMORE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Mr. Lincoln</hi>, in his progress from
his village home on the prairies of Illinois to Washington, in order
to take upon himself the duties of President of the United States, did
not make, as had been anticipated, a public entry into Baltimore,
Maryland.  The people of Baltimore, however, not being aware of Mr.
Lincoln's sudden flight to the capital, crowded the streets during the
greater part of the day on the 23rd ult., to catch a glimpse of the
new President.  At the Calvert Station, where he was expected from
Harrisburg, there was an assemblage of persons such as had probably
never before been seen in that city.  At one o'clock it was impossible
to approach within a square of the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t from any direction, and the
ascent of Franklin-street was crowded up to Courtland-street.  We
engrave on page 266 a lively sketch of the busy scene forwarded by a
Correspondent.  The crowds were, however, doomed to disappointment.
It became at length generally known that Mr. Lincoln had passed
through Baltimore by an early train, and was then at Washington, and
the crodws [sic] gradually dispersed.  There were various conjectures
afloat as to the cause of this hasty and secret  movement of Mr.
Lincoln.  One of the rumours was to the effect that he had received a
despatch from Washington requiring his presence in that city, in order
to use his influence with the Peace Congress in favour of conciliation
and compromise.  Another rumour was that his friends thought there was
danger of a disturbance in Baltimore.  A third rumour darkly hinted at
attempts to assassinate the President elect.  The fact that Mr.
Lincoln called on President Buchanan immediately after reaching
Washington might, however, lead to the inference that he was called to
that city by the President.</p>
               <p>According to a local print, the
prevailing feeling excited by Mr. Lincoln's quiet passage through
Baltimore was one of relief and of gratification, though expressions
of disappointed curiosity were frequently heard.  The injudicious
determination of certain political friends of the President elect in
that city to mark his arrival with a public demonstration had excited
a spirit of stern opposition, which it was feared would manifest
itself in acts which, though designed directly to rebuke the
ill-advised zeal of the parties referred to, might yet have been
misconstrued into a personal affront to the President elect, and so
have reflected discreditably upon the good repute of
Baltimore.</p>

last Number contained a Portrait of the Hon. Jefferson Davis, of
Mississippi, President of the Confederate States of America; and we
now give, from a photograph by A.C. M'Intyre, of Montgomery, an
Illustration of the ceremony of Mr. Davis's inauguration.  The hon.
gentleman arrived at Montgomery, Alabama&#x2014;where the Southern Congress
is sitting, and in which town the inaugural ceremony took place&#x2014;on
Saturday, the 16th of February last. His trip from his home in
Mississippi was one continuous ovation.  At twenty-four different
places along his route he was called out, and made speeches in return
for complimentary addresses.  At various d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;ts, also, salutes were
fired by local military companies.  The Committee of Congress and the
Montgomery authorities met the new President about eighty miles off,
and formally received him.  Two fine military companies from Columbus,
Ga., joined the escort at Opelika. They all reached Montgomery at ten
o'clock at night, amid shouts from the enthusiastic populace and the
firing of cannon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jefferson Davis was inaugurated
President of the Provisional Government of the Confederate States of
America on Monday 18th ult.  The inaugural ceremonies constituted, we
are told, the grandest pageant ever witnessed in the South.  The city
was alive, from early morning, with delegations from the various
States and people from the adjoining country, and the Capitol Hill was
filled with the beauty and chivalry of the South.  A large number of
military companies from this State, Mississippi, and Georgia were also
present, and gave &#x00E9;clat to the occasion.  The oath of office was
administered to the President by the Chief Justice of Alabama in the
principal hall of the Capitol.  In his immediate presence were the
members of the Southern Congress, now in session at Montgomery, the
delegations from the Confederate States, and the chief civil and
military authorities.</p>
               <p>Another account says:&#x2014;As soon as the
procession reached the Capitol Square, and the military were placed in
position, the barouche which conveyed President Davis was brought up,
and its occupants alighted amidst the shouts of thousands.  The bands
played the "Marseillaise," and its cheering and stirring notes
awakened memories of "long time ago," and sent a thrill through  the
vast crowd.  The President was cheered and greeted until he reached
the porch of the Capitol, and then, when he appeared in full view to
the crowd, one universal shout rent the air. Ladies waved their
handkerchiefs, and many threw bouquets.  On the right of President
Davis sat Vice-President Stephens, and on his left was the Hon. Howell
Cobb.  Prayer was offered by the Rev. Dr. Basil Manly.  Mr. Cobb
formally announced that President Davis had arrived, and was now ready
to take the oath of office, as President of the Confederate States of
America.  President Davis then came forward and delivered his
address&#x2014;an abstract of which has appeared in this Journal.  At the
close of the President's speech the oath of office was administered to
him by Mr. Cobb.</p>
               <p>On the same day the members of Congress
signed the Constitution in the following order&#x2014;the names of the
States having been entered on the parchment according to their
geographical position&#x2014;South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana.</p>

ADDRESS.<lb/>

                  <hi rend="small">FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE UNITED
STATES,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In compliance with a custom as old as the
Government itself, I appear before you to address you briefly, and to
take in your presence the oath prescribed by the Constitution of the
United States to be taken by the President before he enters on the
execution of his office.</p>
               <p>I do not consider it necessary at
present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which
there is no special anxiety or excitement.</p>
               <p>Apprehension seems
to exist among the people of the Southern States that, by the
accession of a Republican Administration, their property and their
peace and personal security are to be endangered.  There has never
been any reasonable cause for such apprehension.  Indeed, the most
ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open
to their inspection.  It is found in nearly all the published speeches
of him who now addresses you.  I do but quote from one of these
speeches when I declare that "I have no purpose, directly or
indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States
where it exists; I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have
no inclination to do so."  Those who nominated and elected me do so
with a full knowledge that I have made this and many similar
declarations, and had never recanted them.  And more than this, they
placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a law to themselves
and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>"Resolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the
States, and especially the right of each State to order and control
its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment
exclusively, is essential to that balance of power on which the
perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend, and we
denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State
or territory, no matter under what pretext, as the gravest of
crimes."</p>
               <p>I now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so I
only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of
which the case is susceptible, that the property, peace, and security
of no section are to be in anywise endangered by the now incoming
Administration.  I add, too, that all the protection which,
consistently with the Constitution and the laws, can be given will be
cheerfully given to all the States, when lawfully demanded, for
whatever cause, as cheerfully to one section as to another.</p>
               <p>There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from
service or labour.  The clause I now read is as plainly written in the
Constitution as any other of its provisions:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>"No person held
to service or labour in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping
into another shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein,
be discharged from such service or labour, but shall be delivered up
on claim of the party to whom such service or labour may be due."</p>
               <p>It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by
those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves,
and the intention of the lawgiver is the law.  All members of Congress
swear their support to the whole Constitution, to this provision as
much as any other.  To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases
come within the terms of this clause, "shall be delivered up," their
oaths are unanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good
temper, could they not, with nearly equal unanimity, frame and pass a
law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath?  There is some
difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by
national or by State authority; but, surely, that difference is not a
very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered it can be of but
little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done.
And should any one, in any case, be content that this oath shall go
unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be
kept?  Again, in any law upon this subject, ought not all the
safeguards of liberty known in civilised and humane jurisprudence to
be introduced, so that a free man be not, in any case, surrendered as
a slave?  And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law
for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which
guarantees that " the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
the privileges and immunities of citizens in several States."  I take
the official oath to-day with no mental reservations, and with no
purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical
rules; and, while I do not choose now to specify particular Acts of
Congress as proper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much
safer for all, both in official and private stations, to conform to
and abide by all those Acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any
of them, trusting to find impunity in having held them to be
unconstitutional.</p>
               <p>It is seventy-two years since the first
inauguration of a President under our national Constitution.  During
that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have
in succession administered the executive branch of the Government.
They have conducted it through many perils, and generally with great
success. Yet, with all this scope for precedent, I now enter upon the
same task, for the brief constitutional term of four years, under
great and peculiar difficulty.  A disruption of the Federal Union,
heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.  I hold that, in
contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution, the Union of
these States is perpetual.  Perpetuity is implied if not expressed in
the fundamental law of all national Governments.  It is safe to assert
that all government proper never had a provision in its organic law
for its own termination.  Continue to execute all the express
provisions of our national Constitution and the Union will endure for
ever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not
provided for in the instrument itself.  Again, if the United States be
not a Government proper, but an association of States in the nature of
a contract merely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less
than all the parties who made it?  One party to a contract may violate
it&#x2014;break it, so to speak&#x2014;but does it not require all to lawfully
rescind it?</p>
               <p>Descending from these general principles, we find
the proposition that, in legal contemplation, the Union is perpetual,
confirmed by the history of the Union itself.</p>
               <p>The Union is
much older than the Constitution.  It was formed, in fact, by the
Articles of Association in 1774.  It was matured and continued in the
Declaration of Independence in 1776.  It was further matured, and the
faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged
that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of Confederation in 1778;
and finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects for ordaining and
establishing the Constitution was to form a more perfect Union.  But,
if the destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States
be lawfully possible, the Union is less than before, the Constitution
having lost the vital element of perpetuity.</p>
               <p>It follows from
these views that no State, upon its own mere motion, can lawfully get
out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that effect are
legally void; and that acts of violence within any State or States are
insurrectionary or revolutionary, according to circumstances.  I
therefore consider that, in view of the Constitution and the laws, the
Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability I shall take care,
as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of
the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.  Doing this I deem
to be only a simple duty on my part.  I shall perfectly perform it, so
far as is practicable, unless my rightful masters, the American
people, shall withhold the requisition, or in some authoritative
manner direct the contrary.  I trust this will not be regarded as a
menace, but only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will
constitutionally defend and maintain itself.</p>
               <p>In doing this
there need be no bloodshed or violence, and there shall be none,
unless it is forced upon the national authority.  The power confided
to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property and
places belonging to the Government, and collect the duties and
imposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will
be no invasion&#x2014;no using of force against or amongst the people
anywhere.</p>
               <p>Where hostility to the United States shall be so
great and so universal as to prevent  competent resident citizens from
holding the federal offices, there will be no attempt to force
obnoxious strangers among the people that object. While the strict
legal right may exist of the Government to enforce the exercise of
these offices, the attempt to do so would be so irritating, and so
nearly impracticable withal, that I deem it better to forgo for the
time the uses of such offices.</p>
               <p>The mails, unless repelled,
will continue to be furnished to all parts of the Union.</p>
               <p>So
far as possible, the people everywhere shall have that sense of
perfect security which is most favourable to calm thought and
reflection.  The course here indicated will be followed unless current
events and experience shall show a modification or change to be
proper; and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be
exercised according to the circumstances actually existing, and with a
view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and
the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections.  That there
are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union at
all events, and are glad of any pretext to do it, I will neither
affirm nor deny.  But if there be such I need address no word to
them.</p>
               <p>To those, however, who really love the Union may I not
speak?  Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of
our national fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its
hopes, would it would [sic] not be well to ascertain why we do it?
Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any portion of the
ills you fly from that have no real existence?  Will you, while the
certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly
from?  Will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?  All
profess to be content in the Union if all the constitutional rights
can be maintained.  Is it true, then, that any right plainly written
in the Constitution has been denied?  I think not.  Happily the human
mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of
doing this.  Think, if you can, of a single instance in which a
plainly-written provision of the Constitution has ever been denied.
If, by the mere force of numbers, a majority should deprive a minority
of any clearly-written constitutional right, it might, in a moral
point of view, justify revolution&#x2014;certainly would, if such right were
a vital one.  But such is not the case.</p>
               <p>All the vital rights
of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by
affirmations and negations, guarantees and prohibitions, in the
Constitution that controversies never arise concerning them.  But no
organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically
applicable to every question which may occur in practical
administration.  No foresight can anticipate, nor any document of
reasonable length contain, express provisions for all possible
questions.  Shall fugitives from labour be surrendered by national or
by State authority?  The Constitution does not expressly say.  Must
Congress protect slavery in the territories? The Constitution does not
expressly say.  From questions of this class spring all our
constitutional controversies, and we divide upon them into majorities
and minorities.</p>
               <p>If the minority will not acquiesce, the
majority must, or the Government must cease.  There is no alternative
for continuing the Government but acquiescence on the one side or the
other.  If a minority in such a case will secede rather than
acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn will ruin and divide
them, for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a
majority refuses to be controlled by such a minority.  For instance,
why not any portion of a new confederacy, a year or two hence,
arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present Union
now claim to secede from it?  All who cherish disunion sentiments are
now being educated to the exact temper of doing this. Is there such
perfect identity of interests among the States to comprise a new Union
as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession?  Plainly,
the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy.</p>
               <p>A
majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations,
and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions
and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.  Whoever
rejects it does, of necessity, fly to anarchy or to despotism.
Unanimity is impossible.  The rule of a minority, as a permanent
arrangement, is wholly inadmissible.  So that, rejecting the majority
principle, anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left.</p>
               <p>I do not forget the position assumed by some, that constitutional
questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that
such decisions must be binding, in any case, upon the parties to a
suit, as to the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to
very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other
departments of the Government; and, while it is obviously possible
that such decision may be erroneous in any given case, still the evil
effect following it, being limited to that particular case, with the
chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other
cases, can better be borne than could the evils of a different
practice.  At the same time the candid citizen must confess that, if
the policy of the Government upon the vital questions affecting the
whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by the decisions of the
Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation
between the parties in personal actions, the people will have ceased
to be their own, unless having, to that extent, practically resigned
their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.  Nor is
there in this view any assault upon the Court or the Judges.</p>
               <p>It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases
properly brought before them, and it is no fault of theirs if others
seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.  One section of
our country believes slavery is right, and ought to be extended, while
the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended.  This is
the only substantial dispute; and the laws for the suppression of the
foreign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can
ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly
supports the law itself.  The great body of the people abide by the
dry, legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each.
This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in
both cases after the separation of the sections than before.  The
foreign slave trade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately
revived, without restriction, in one section, while fugitive slaves,
now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the
other.  Physically speaking, we cannot separate&#x2014;we cannot remove our
respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall
between them.  A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the
presence and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts
of our country cannot do this.  They cannot but remain face to face,
and intercourse, either amicable or hostile, must continue between
them.  Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more
advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before?  Can
aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws?  Can treaties
be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among
friends?  Suppose you go to war; you cannot fight always; and when,
after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease
fighting, the identical questions as to terms of intercourse are again
upon you.  This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people
who inhabit it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing
Government, they can exercise their constitutional right of amending,
or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow, it.  I cannot
be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are
desirous of having the national Constitution amended.  While I make no
recommendation of amendment, I freely recognise the full authority of
the people over the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the
modes prescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under
existing circumstances, favour rather than oppose a fair opportunity
being afforded the people to act upon it.  I will venture to add that
to me the convention mode seems preferable, in that it allows
amendments to originate with the people themselves, instead of only
permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others
not specially chosen for the purpose, and which might not be precisely
such at [sic] they would wish themselves to accept or refuse. I
understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution&#x2014;which amendment,
however, I have not seen&#x2014;has passed Congress, to the effect that the
Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic
institutions of States, including that of persons held to service.  To
avoid misconstruction of most that I have said, I depart from my
purpose, not to speak of particular amendments, so far as to say that,
holding such a provision to be implied constitutional law, I have no
objection to its being made express and irrevocable.  The Chief
Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they
conferred none upon him to fix the terms for the separation of the
States.  The people themselves also can do this if they choose; but
the Executive, as such, has nothing to do with it.  His duty is to
administer the present Government as it came to his hands, and to
transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor.  Why should there not
be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people?  Is
there any better or equal hope in the world?  In our present
differences, is either party without faith of being in the right?  If
the Almighty ruler of nations, with His eternal truth and justice, be
on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that truth and
that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great
tribunal&#x2014;the American people.  By the frame of the Government under
which we live, this same people have wisely given their public
servants but little power for mischief, and have, with equal wisdom,
provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very
short intervals.  While the people retain their virtue and vigilance,
no Administration, by any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very
seriously injure the Government in the short space of four years.</p>
               <p>My countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole
subject.  Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time.</p>
               <p>If
there be an object to hurry any of you, in hot haste, to a step which
you would never take deliberately, that object will be frustrated by
taking time; but no good object can be frustrated by it.  Such of you
as are now dissatisfied still have the old Constitution unimpaired,
and, on the sensitive point, the laws of your own framing under it,
while the new Administration will have no immediate power, if it
would, to change either.  If it were admitted that you who are
dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute, there still is no
single reason for precipitate action.  Intelligence, patriotism,
Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who has never yet forsaken
this favoured land, are still competent to adjust in the best way all
our present difficulty.</p>
               <p>In your hands, my dissatisfied
fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil
war.  The Government will not assail you.  You can have no conflict
without being yourselves the aggressors.  You have no oath registered
in heaven to destroy the Government, while I shall have the most
solemn one to "preserve, protect, and defend" it.  I am loth to close.
 We are not enemies, but friends.  We must not be enemies.  Though
passion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds of affection.
The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battle-field and
patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this
broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again touched,
as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.</p>

               <p>THE UNITED STATES'
NAVY.&#x2014;Mr. Dowes, of Massachusetts, from the Committee of the House of
Representatives to whom was referred the President's message of Jan.
8, has reported concerning the United States' navy.  It appears that
there are now in commission, in various parts of the world,
forty-eight vessels; that twenty-eight are unfit for service, and not
to be repaired under several weeks' or even months' time; that the
entire naval force available for the defence of the Atlantic coast at
the time this committee was appointed consisted of the steamer
Brooklyn, of 25 guns, and the store-ship Relief, of two guns; the
former being unable, by reason of her draught, to enter Charleston
harbour with safety, and the latter being under orders for the African
coast.  Under these circumstances, the committee refer with much
severity to the extraordinary disposition of our naval force, by which
it was kept out of the way in a manner which would be injudicious at
any time, but which now clearly showed hopeless imbecility or a
deliberate conspiracy to give the country into the hands of traitors.
The report next takes up the matter of resignations by traitorous
naval officers, sets forth in plain terms the name and offense of each
of these, and places in a clear light the extraordinary conduct of the
Secretary of the Navy in accepting the resignations, concluding by
recommending the passage of a resolution of censure upon that Cabinet
officer.&#x2014;<title>New York Tribune</title>.</p>

State Legislature may impeach judicial or federal officers, resident

basis of three fifths for slaves is continued. Congress is not
allowed, through duties, to foster any branch of industry.  The
foreign slave trade is prohibited.  The President and Vice-President
are to hold to office for six years.  The principal officers of
departments and the diplomatic service are removable at the pleasure

               </p>
               <p>. . . The
mention of slavery naturally brings to the mind the recollection of
the state of affairs in the United States, always supposing that we
can continue to apply that title to a country in a state of chronic
disunion.  The attitude assumed by the South is very striking.  There
seems to be no lack of resources towards the organisation of an army,
to meet which the Northern provinces have no adequate means, unless
resort be had to the calling out of the militia, as in case of war
with a foreign Power. What would be the result of such a step it is
not easy for us in this country to say; but an opinion may be hazarded
that it would probably not be found to be in unison with the feeling
of the majority of the people.  As far as can yet be judged it seems
as if the North expects the President to fight the voluntary levies of
the South&#x2014;if matters come to the arbitrement of arms&#x2014;with the
regularly-enlisted federal troops; in which case it would be a nominal
12,000 against an actual 50,000.  That the South means mischief is
evident by the vast preparations in the shape of guns, gunpowder, and
materials of war which are in process of manufacture.  In scanning the
regulations for the conduct of the Government of the federation of the
South, one cannot but be struck with one enactment which is a decided
innovation on the system which has hitherto prevailed in America.  It
is, that the responsible Ministers of the President are to have seats
in Congress, and to be allowed to discuss and defend the measures of
the Government.  Is this a step towards the adoption of some of the
so-called aristocratic customs of the old country?</p>

LINCOLN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> inauguration of Abraham Lincoln as President
of the United States was celebrated on the 4th inst. with the usual
honours, and with more than the usual solemnity. No disturbance marred
the august proceedings, and all went off harmoniously, and to the
general satisfaction.  The appearance of the President elect on the
platform erected in front of the eastern portico of the Capitol was
greeted with cheering by the many thousand citizens assembled in the
grounds, filling the square and open space, and perching on every
tree, fence, or stone affording a convenient point from which to see
or hear.  In a few minutes the portico was also densely crowded with
both sexes.  On the front of the steps was erected a wooden canopy,
under which were seated Mr. Buchanan, Chief Justice Taney, Senators
Chase and Baker, and the President elect, while at the left of the
small table on which was placed the Inaugural stood Colonel Selden,
Marshal of the District.  At the left of the canopy sat the entire
Diplomatic Corps.  Beyond them was the Marine band, which played
several patriotic airs before and after the reading of the Address.
To the right of the diplomatists sat, in silk gowns and hats, the
members of the Supreme Court.  Then came senators, members of the
House, distinguished guests, and fair ladies by the score; while the
immediate right of the canopy was occupied by the son and Private
Secretaries of Mr. Lincoln.  Everything being in readiness, Senator
Baker came forward and said:- "Fellow-citizens, I introduce to you
Abraham Lincoln, the President elect of the United States of America."
 Whereupon Mr. Lincoln arose, walked deliberately and composedly to
the table, and bent low in honour of the repeated cheering of the
countless host before him.  Having put on his spectacles, he arranged
his manuscript on the small table, keeping the paper thereon by the
aid of his cane, and commenced, in a clear, ringing voice, that was
easily heard by those on the outer limits of the crowd, to read his
inaugural address to the people of the United States.  After the
delivery of the Address Judge Taney stood up, and all removed their
hats, while he administered to Mr. Lincoln the oath of office as
follows:&#x2014;"I, Abraham Lincoln, do solemnly swear that I will
faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and
will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States."</p>

               </p>
               <p>.  . . . Again, no man in this country, even if
he dwell ever so remote from Lancashire, can view without apprehension
the situation of the American States and their relation to our
manufacturing interests.  It is in the face of ominous and threatening
conjunctures like these that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had
to frame his financial scheme for the coming year. It is impossible to
suppose that he can pursue any other course than that of the most
careful adaptation of his scheme to the patent exigencies of the
moment.  There is, therefore, no expectation of an experimental
Budget; but, looking to the Estimates which have been already under
discussion in Parliament, it is not easy to see how the proposed
expenditure is to be met without recourse being had to some mutations,
if not exactly to what a Finance Minister would call an increase, of
taxation.  What we mean to intimate is that there is just a
possibility of a reduction in the tea and sugar duties, and a resort
to the sweet simplicity of a shilling in the pound income tax.  How
such a specimen of presdigitation [sic] on the part of a Chancellor of
the Exchequer would be received by the British public it is not for us
to say.  One thing is clear, that, looking to the uncertainty of
affairs abroad and to the estimated expenditure at home, the taxpayer
must not hope for any actual relief from burdens, although, perhaps,
there may be some clever manipulations in the way of shifting the
load.</p>

Britain respecting the sovereignty of the island of San Juan shall be
referred to the arbitration of Switzerland.</p>
               <p>President Lincoln
has returned no reply to the Southern Commissioners.  His
Administration, it is stated, are still labouring in the interests of
peace; and it was even said that Messrs. Seward and Chase, the two
most influential members of the Cabinet, were disposed to favour a
peaceful separation, as the most practicable solution of the existing
difficulties.</p>

United States' representatives abroad:&#x2014;Charles Francis Adams,
Minister to England; William L. Dayton, Minister to France; N.P. Judd,
Minister to Prussia; George P. Marsh, Minister to Sardinia; James
Watson Webb, Minister to Turkey; Jacob T. Holderman, Minister to
Sweden; W.S. Thayer, Consul-General to Alexandria.  Mr. Adams is
grandson of the first Ambassador from the United States to this
country; and Mr. Dayton was the nominee of the Republican party for
the Vice-Presidency in 1856.</p>

Alabama; Judge Rost, of Louisiana; Colonel Mann, and Mr. Botler King,
of Georgia, as Special Commissioners to proceed to England and France
for the purpose of obtaining the recognition of the independence of
the Confederated States, and to make such commercial arrangements as
their joint interests may require.</p>
               <p>The Congress at Montgomery

those sailing under the "stars and stripes."</p>

                  <hi rend="center">RAILWAY-CARS IN
AMERICA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> external appearance of most of the American
railway-carriages, called in the States cars, is exceedingly plain,
and on entering them for the first time one is surprised to find them
fitted up so comfortably, even handsomely, in the interior. There is
only one class of car in the United States for all classes, except
emigrants; and emigrant-cars are just like the third-class carriages
in Great Britain, only that they are arranged in the same style inside
as the other American railway-carriages.  Instead of the small
compartments for six first class or eight or ten second-class
passengers, as in Britain, the whole car inside is an open space, as a
saloon carriage.  In the centre there is a passage for the conductor,
ticket-collector, and itinerant salesmen.  The seats are arranged on
both sides of the pathway, and fitted up handsomely with velvet, there
being room for two passengers in each seat.  By an ingenious
contrivance the backs of the seats are made to turn right over the
seat, so that parties of four can sit together.  The fittings of the
cars are good, and in many of them there are mirrors at both ends. The
floors are always carpeted or matted, and the windows have generally
Venetian blinds and shutters for the night, or for severely cold
weather.  Each car will hold from fifty to sixty passengers.  It is
open at the ends, where there are small platforms.  A passage is thus
formed from one end to the other of the entire train.  Along the
ceiling there is a rope, which is attached throughout the whole train,
so that the conductor or any passenger can, by pulling this rope, ring
a bell which is placed at the side of the engine-driver, and thus
cause the train to be stopped if necessary.  There is at one end of
each carriage a large stone filter, with a tin mug attached for
general use in summer time; and in winter stoves are introduced.</p>
               <p>Many of the railway-cars in Canada and in the States are made to do
double duty, being turned by night into bedrooms.  The transformation
scene is thus described in a most interesting article on railway
travelling in America contained in the number of <hi rend="italic">All the Year Round</hi>
for the 12th of January last:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>"More bell, more steam,
smothering us all with white&#x2014;a wrench, a drag, a jolt back half angry,
as if the engine were sulky and restive, and we are off.  The
signal-posts stride by us, the timber-yards fly by, and we are in the
open country, with its zigzag snake fences, and Indian corn patches
and piles of orange pumpkins. Now ladies come in from other carriages,
for the restless or seeking traveller can walk all through an American
train.  We are seated in twos and twos, some at nuts, some at books,
some flirting, some musing, some chatting, some discussing 'the
irrepressible squabble,' many chewings, or cutting plugs of tobacco
from long wedges, produced from their waistcoat-pockets.  The
candy-boys have been round three times, the negro boys with the
water-can twice, the lad with the book-basket once.  One hour from
Albany, we are at Hoffman's; twenty minutes more, at Amsterdam; fifty
minutes more, and we have reached Spraker's&#x2014;pure Dutch names all, as
though Hudson christened them. Now, as we are between Little Falls and
Herkeimer, the officer of the sleeping-cars enters and calls out, 'Now
then, misters, if you please, get up from your seats, and allow me to
make up the beds!'  Two by two we rise, and with neat trimness and
quick hand the nimble Yankee turns over every other seat, so as to
reverse the back, and make two seats, one facing the other.  Nimbly he
shuts the

windows and pulls
up the shutters, leaving for ventilation the slip of perforated zinc
open at the top of each.  Smartly he strips up the cushions, and
unfastens from beneath each seat a light cane-bottomed frame there
secreted.  In a moment, opening certain ratchet-holes in the wall of
the carriage, he has slided these in at a suitable height above, and
covered each with cushions and sleeping-rug.  I go outside on the
balcony, to be out of the way, and when I come back the whole place is
transformed&#x2014;no longer an aisle of double seats, like a section of a
proprietary chapel put on wheels, but the cabin of a small steamer,
snug for sleeping, with curtained berths and closed portholes.</p>
               <p>"O dextrous genius of Zenas Wallace and Erza Jones, conductors of
the New York Central Railway!  The lights of the candle-lamps are
dimmed or withdrawn; a hushed stillness pervades the chamber of sleep;
no sound breaks it but the clump of falling boots, and the
button-slapping sound of coats flung upon benches.  Further on, within
a second inclosure, I hear voices of women and children.  A fat German
haberdasher from Cincinnati is unrobing himself for sleep. He takes
off his 'undress' as if he were performing a religious ceremony, and,
indeed, sleep is a rehearsal of death, and seems rather a solemn
thing, however we look at it.</p>
               <p>"The bottom berths are singularly
comfortable.  There is room to wander and explore, to roll and turn,
and the curtains hush all sound, and keep off all inquisitive rays
from Zenas' and Ezra's portable lamps.  There is, indeed, twice the
room I had in the Atlantic steamer that brought me over, for in that
berth I could not sit up at night without bumping my head against No.
46's bed-planks, and could not turn without pulling all the scant
clothes off me.  As for a heavy sea, why then there was no keeping in
bed at all without being lashed in.</p>
               <p>"Now I mount my berth;
for sleep is sympathetic, and, when every one else goes to sleep, I
must too.  There are two berths to choose from; both wicker trays,
ledged in, cushioned, and rugged; one about half a foot higher than
the other.  I choose the top one, as being nearer the zinc
ventilator.</p>
               <p>"Several have turned in, and are now snorting
approval of themselves and of sleep as an institution generally.
Others, like young crows, balancing on the spring boughs, swing their
Yankee legs, lean and yellow, from the wicker trays, and peel off
their stockings, or struggle to get rid of their boots.  A Mississippi
man, in a faded green dress-coat and gilt buttons, undoes the blue
ribbon that fancifully and romantically fastens his coat in front.</p>
               <p>"My tray was narrow and high.  It was like lying on one's back on
the narrow plank thrown across a torrent.  If I turned my back to the
carriage wall the motion bumped me off my bed altogether; if I turned
my face to the wall I felt a horrible sensation of being likely to
roll down backwards, to be three minutes afterwards picked up in
detached portions.  I lay on my back, and so settled the
question."</p>

and in good taste.  His hat is sure to be of the best, his boots of
the glossiest patent leather, and the rest of his adornments to match.
 One rainy Sunday, in Baltimore, our Artist saw and sketched one of
these dandy negroes escorting home from church his mistress.  He was a
slave, and this poor old faded woman owned him. He was proud and fond
of her, and she, no doubt, not a little attached to him.  "Oh," he
said, "my misses is a very good misses; fine old lady; lets me do
pretty much as I'm a mind 'ter.  If I feel like playing sodger, I
plays sodger; and if I feels like work, I works.  I ollers gives her
half my wages, and she never asks no questions.  Oh, lor, no; I
wouldn't think of running away, or doing nothing that could noways
annoy her.  I gets plenty of money; hire myself down on steam-boat,
Sir.  I'm very good waiter; the ladies mostly likes me; and steam-boat
captain likes to have waiters as is pop'lar with the ladies.  I never
gives no sass to nobody.  It's very easy getting along when you make
it a rule never to give no sass to nobody."  And so our slave was
getting along, making, probably, two guineas a week over and above the
share of his wages due to his owners.  Every month or so he would draw
his pay from the steam-boat or hotel proprietor he might be serving at
the time, take it home and divide it with his "misses," have a chat
with the old lady, and pay her homage by waiting at table in his
highest style, and perhaps, as our Artist saw him, escort her to and
from the "meetin'-house."</p>

is one of the longer sides of the room.  The ceiling is of cast iron,
with large skylights.  The cast-iron ceiling is deeply coffered with
sunk panels, relieved with enriched mouldings.  A richly-decorated
cornice along the upper part of the wall, above the galleries, unites
the wall and ceiling.  The skylights are glazed with ornamented glass,
having in the centre of each skylight the arms of a State or
Territory, emblazoned in coloured glass.  The decoration of the Hall
is yet far from complete.  Panels on the gallery fronts have been
provided, which it is expected will be filled with pictures of
American history, under the orders to be given by Congress; and the
upper part of the walls is filled with niches, empty as yet, but which
will, at some future day, be tenanted by the effigies in marble of
their worthiest citizens.</p>
               <p>The scene as depicted by our Artist
at page 310 is highly characteristic, and is not, as may be supposed,
wholly, if at all, in caricature.  The contrast which it presents to
our House of Commons is very striking.  With us, though the appearance
of members is easy enough, especially owing to their privilege of
wearing their hats when seated, yet the arrangements of the seats
renders their attitudes, as a rule, somewhat rigid, and any comfort in
the way of lounging, as well as reading or writing, is not attainable
in the House proper, though there is every facility in that way in the
anterooms and libraries.  None of the messengers of the House are
permitted to come within the bar; and the reading of a newspaper or
any book, but such as are used for quotation in debate, puts a member
out of order. Exactly the reverse state of things prevails in the
House of Representatives.  Desks for writing and easy-chairs for
lounging occupy the floor of the chamber; newspapers appear to be the
rule; and lads bearing letters and messages are running about
continually, like so many rabbits in a warren.  Sometimes our
legislators are noisy and excited; but no one ever saw any of them
exhibiting in such <hi rend="italic">poses</hi> as are depicted in our Illustration, which,
looking at the comparative unconcern which appears to prevail, seem to
be nothing extraordinary in the Transatlantic Assembly.</p>

               <p>REMARKABLE MARRIAGE CASE.&#x2014;A singular trial has
just terminated in the United States, by which a lady named Gaines,
after thirty years' litigation, has become the richest woman in
America.  One of the earliest settlers in Louisiana was Daniel Clark,
who was at the head of the monetary and social circle of that State on
account of his great business talents, wealth, and agreeable person
and manners.   In 1802 he married secretly a beautiful Frenchwoman,
named Zulime Carri&#x00E8;re.  She had been married to a Jerome de Grange,
who had represented himself as a nobleman, but who turned out to be a
confectioner, and likewise a bigamist.  In 1806 Zulime had a daughter
by Clark, named Myra, the present Mrs. Gaines.  Zulime went to New
Orleans to obtain proofs of her first husband's rascality, in order to
be enabled to have her marriage with Daniel Clark made public, and
while she was gone Clark became enamoured with a Miss Caton, and was
engaged to marry her.  She, however, heard of his marriage with Zulime
Carri&#x00E8;re, and the engagement was broken off.  Miss Caton afterwards
became Marchioness Wellesley.  Clark, in order to marry Miss Caton,
had destroyed every documentary proof of his marriage with Zulime that
he could lay hold of, and when she returned from New Orleans he
abandoned her, destitute and helpless, with an infant child.  A Dr.
Gardette protected and married her.  Clark afterwards repented, and
took his daughter, Mrs. Gaines, and had her educated.  He died in
1813, and the immense fortune he amassed in Louisiana, Missouri,
Kentucky, and Maryland, he left to his mother.  His wife, Zulime
Carri&#x00E8;re, died a few years since at New Orleans, nearly eighty years
of age.  Myra, her daughter, married a Mr. Whitney, and afterwards
General Gaines, and her whole life has been devoted in establishing
the legitimacy of her birth, the honour of her mother, and her claims
to the princely fortune of the millionaire Clark.  She has just
succeeded in doing this.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The latest news from America
throws no light on the obscurity of President Lincoln's movements, or
rather inaction.  The Cabinet was still considering what course should
be pursued towards the Confederated States.  The commissioners from
the latter remained at Washington, but had not been recognised by the
President.  Both parties were making vast preparations for a contest,
the probabilities of which every day seem to lessen, though no one can
divine how an arrangement will be effected.  Fort Sumter had not been
evacuated, but the Cabinet, it was reported, had arranged for its
cession, as well as for that of Fort Pickens.  The Government have
also determined not to attempt to collect the revenue in the Gulf
ports.  Everything tends to show that Mr. Lincoln will not resort as
yet, if at all, to hostile proceedings against the disunionists.  The
Louisiana Convention is expected to declare in favour of free trade
between the Western States and the Southern Confederacy.  Confusion
and lawlessness seem to be spreading from the Atlantic to the Pacific
States; for it is said that a body of filibusters has invaded lower
California.</p>
               <p>The following are the main points of difference
between the United States Constitution and the new Southern
Constitution, or rather these are the additions made by the South,
which in other respects has largely copied the old Constitution:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>1, That African slavery in the Territories shall be recognised and
protected by Congress and the Territorial Legislatures. 2, That the
right to slaveholders of transit and sojourn in any State of the
Confederacy, with their slaves and other property, shall be recognised
and respected.  3, That the provision in regard to fugitive slaves
shall extend to any slave lawfully carried from one State into
another, and there escaping or taken away from his master.  4, That no
bill or <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> law (by Congress or any State), and no law
impairing or denying the right of property in negro slaves, shall be
passed.  5, That the African slave trade shall be prohibited by such
laws of Congress as shall effectually prevent the same.  6, The
absolute prohibition of all bounties from the Federal Treasury, and
all duties or taxes on imported goods intended to promote or foster
any branch of home industry.  7, A positive prohibition of Federal
appropriations for internal improvements, and the substitution of
local tonnage duties for such improvements.  8, The restriction of
Congress by a majority vote to such appropriations as may be
recommended by the President or some executive department, all other
appropriations requiring a two-thirds vote.  9, The holding of
contractors to the strict letter of their contracts.  10, That the
Post-office department shall pay its own expenses.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> Congress sitting at Montgomery,
Alabama, before its adjournment, adopted a report of the Special
Committee appointed to devise a flag for the new Republic.  This was a
subject of grave deliberation. Severa [sic] designs were sent in by
patriotic Southern ladies; but the Committee decided upon the flag of
which we give an Engraving.  On presenting their design for the
acceptance of the Provisional Congress, the chairman explained it in
the following words:&#x2014;"A flag should be simple, readily made, and,
above all, capable of being made up in bunting; it should be different
from the flag of any other country, place, or people; it should be
significant; it should be readily distinguishable at a distance; the
colours should be well contrasted and durable; and lastly, and not the
least important point, it should be effective and handsome.  The
Committee humbly think that the flag which they submit combines these
requisites.  It is very easy to make.  It is entirely different from
any national flag.  The three colours of which it is composed&#x2014;red,
white, and blue&#x2014;are the true Republican colours.  In heraldry they
are emblematic of the three great virtues&#x2014;of valour, purity, and
truth.  Naval men assure us that it can be recognised at a great
distance.  The colours contrast admirably, and are lasting.  In effect
and appearance it must speak for itself.  Your Committee, therefore,
recommend that the flag of the Confederate States of America shall
consist of a red field, with a white space extending horizontally
through the centre, and equal in width to one-third the width of the
flag; the red spaces above and below, to be of the same width as the
white; the union blue extending down through the white space, and
stopping at the lower red space; in the centre of the union a circle
of white stars corresponding in number with the States in the
Confederacy."</p>
               <p>"The design of this flag," says the <title>New
York Herald</title>, "is striking, and it has the merit of originality
as well as of durability.  The upper and lower sections, composing the
'fly' part, are red; the middle section white; while a blue union,
containing seven stars in a circle, reaches from the top to the lower
red.  This flag possesses an heraldic significance probably not
comprehended by the uninitiated.  The blue union signifies firmness,
constancy, faithfulness; the white, purity and peace; and red is
emblematic of war.  With the seven stars in the blue this flag can be
read as follows:&#x2014;'Blue&#x2014;Seven States have entered into a covenant of
good faith; White&#x2014;to promote the general welfare in time of peace;
Red&#x2014;to provide a common defence in times of war.'  To assist the
reader to interpret the flag more fully we would state that in
engraving heraldic devices it is rulable to make the portions
delineating blue in horizontal lines, and red in perpendicular
ones."</p>
               <p>The flag was unfurled at Montgomery on the 4th of March
last.  The <title>Montgomery Advertiser</title> of the 5th ult.
says:&#x2014;"Yesterday was an eventful day in the provisional capital of
the Confederate States of America, as well as in Washington.  At
half-past three p.m. the flag of the Confederates [sic] States of
America was flung out to the breeze from the staff of the Capitol,
and, as its proud folds gradually unclosed, it seemed to wave defiance
to the northern wind that came rushing down from the Potomac laden
with threats of Abolition coercion.  A large concourse of spectators
had assembled on Capitol Hill.  Miss L.C. Tyler, one of the fair
descendants of the Old Dominion, and a granddaughter of the venerable
ex-President of the United States, had been selected to perform the
principal part upon this occasion.  When the time had arrived for
raising the banner Miss Tyler elevated the flag to the summit of the
staff, cannon thundered forth a salute, the vast assemblage rent the
air with shouts of welcome, and the people of the South had for the
first time a view of the Southern flag.  Ere there was time to take
one hasty glance at the national ensign, the eyes of all were upturned
to gaze at what would perhaps at any time have attracted unusual
attention, but on this occasion seemed really a providential omen.
Scarcely had the first report from the salute died away when a large
and beautifully-defined circle of blue vapour rose slowly over the
assemblage of Southern spirits there assembled to vow allegiance to
the Southern banner, rested for many seconds on a level with the flag
of the Confederate States, then gradually ascended until lost to the
gaze of the multitude.  It was a most beautiful and auspicious omen,
and those who look with an eye of faith to the glorious future of our
Confederacy could not but believe that the same God that vouchsafed to
the Christian Emperor the cross in the heavens as a promise of victory
had this day given to a young nation striving for a liberty a Divine
augury of hope and national durability."</p>

               <p>NEW YORK NEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE.&#x2014;The leading New York daily papers
sell all at two cents, or one penny, per copy.  This does not,
however, prevent their taking advantage of the quickest, and therefore
most expensive methods of obtaining the news from all parts of the
world. The telegraphs are almost monopolised by the newspapers, and
sometimes more than  &#x00A3;500 is paid for telegrams in a day by a single
journal. Notwithstanding the enormous daily cost of publishing a
<title>Herald</title>, a <title>Tribune</title>, or a
<title>Times</title>, these journals are yielding princely revenues to
their proprietors.  The higher-priced newspapers, such as the
<title>Evening Post</title>, the <title>Journal of Commerce</title>,
and the <title>Courier and Enquirer</title>, have more limited
circulation, but they can hardly be less profitable, on account of
their extensive advertising patronage.  The <title>Daily
Herald</title> has the most extensive circulation.  The daily issue is
variously estimated at from 70,000 to 90,000.  The daily issues of the
<title>Times</title> and <title>Tribune</title> are probably about
equal, though the <title>Tribune</title> has increased in circulation
considerably since the election of Mr. Lincoln, having reached, it is
said, 60,000 copies.  The publishers of the <title>Tribune</title>
have commenced stereotyping their daily edition, having adopted this
plan for the weekly and semi-weekly several months ago.  The aggregate
weekly circulation of the daily, weekly and semi-weekly
<title>Tribune</title> is stated to be 640,000 copies.  The estimated
profits of the <title>Herald</title> and <title>Tribune</title> are
about 100,000 dollars, or  &#x00A3;21,000 each.  The <title>Evening
Post</title> is, perhaps, the most profitable of the old style
four-paged journals. It divided, we notice, 69,000 dollars profits
last year between its proprietors.  Some of the purely weekly papers
and the "monthlies" have a wonderful circulation.  Of the former class
the <title>New York Ledger</title>, the sale of which has, we believe,
reached as high as 500,000 copies, stands first&#x2014;while the
<title>Independent</title>, a politico-religious journal, has doubled
its circulation during the past year, its weekly issue being now about
70,000 copies.  Of the latter, <title>Harper's Magazine</title> leads
off with a circulation of about 200,000 copies of each
issue.&#x2014;<title>London American</title>.</p>

severely indisposed, owing to incessant labour and anxiety.</p>
               <p>The latest intelligence from America is of a most warlike nature.
The <title>New York Herald</title> states that warlike rumours and the
naval preparations of the Government created intense excitement
throughout the city on the 5th inst.  A panic prevailed among stock
operators.  The Washington correspondent of the <title>New York
Herald</title> says the country is on the brink of a civil war.  A
despatch from Charleston, dated the 5th inst., says a terrible moment
is evidently at hand.  News from Washington and New York corroborates
the general impression that within twenty-four hours war will be upon
us.  Every man has been ordered on duty, and the utmost activity
prevails.  The highest officials declare that the present state of
things can last but a short time longer.  The excitement is intense.
Everything wears a warlike aspect.  According to the <title>New York
Times</title>, General Beauregard had declared to Major Anderson that he
must evacuate Fort Sumter, or it would be shelled within forty-eight
hours.  Major Anderson's supplies were to be cut off immediately.  The
United States' frigate Powhattan was fully equipped for sea.  The
Government had chartered the steamer Atlantic, which, with the
Powhattan and the Illinois, would sail immediately under sealed
orders.</p>

enter on the proposal of Great Britain to refer the San Juan question
to arbitration.</p>
               <p>The Morrill tariff came into operation on the

confusion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Schutz has been confirmed by the Senate at

to this effect:&#x2014;Hostilities had commenced.  General Beauregard, on
the approach of the Government vessel, demanded the surrender of Fort

two guns at four a.m. on the 12th inst.  Fort Sumpter [sic] replied
vigorously.  Seven Charleston batteries then operated against Fort
Sumter.  No particular damage had yet been done on either side. Troops
had commenced swarming into Charleston.  It was stated that 20,000 men
were concentrated in that city.  An extra Session of the Southern
Confederacy had been summoned.  The Southern Government had called on
each Secession State for 3000 troops, except Florida, which was to
furnish 1500.  An attack on Washington was anticipated.  The volunteer
militia were under arms.  The Southern Commissioners have left
Washington without having been officially received by President
Lincoln.  The citizens of the Arizona Territory have held a
convention, and have voted themselves out of the Union.  The
Charleston telegraph wires are said to be entirely in the hands of the
Secessionists.  Little confidence is, therefore, placed in the
telegraphic intelligence received from that city.  The Washington
militia have been ordered to muster.  Advices from Havannah to the 7th
inst. state that the Southern Commissioners sailed thence for Europe
on the 6th inst.</p>

               <p>President Lincoln's
Administration is actively prosecuting naval preparations; and it is
asserted that he will call for 50,000 volunteers, and will convoke
Congress.  If half the assertions of the New York press are true, a
speedy collision between the Secessionists and Federalists appears to
be inevitable.  Two transport-ships, with 500 troops and a quantity of
war material on board, accompanied by the cutter Harriet Lane, have
sailed under sealed orders.  The New York journals agree in the
statement that President Lincoln has resolved to throw reinforcements
and supplies into Forts Sumter and Pickens, and to give to Governor
Houlston [sic] military assistance against the Secessionists of
Texas.</p>
               <p>The South Carolinians have, we are assured, declared
that they will not permit Major Anderson to receive any supplies, and
they are redoubling their preparations to prevent the entrance of any
United States' vessels into Charleston harbour.</p>
               <p>President
Davis, of the Southern Confederacy, has called for 18,000 volunteers;
and the accounts from the South are filled with warlike rumours.</p>
               <p>The State of Massachusetts has set an example of enlightened
legislation by the abolition of capital punishment.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN AMERICA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">It</hi> is
believed by those whose experience of men and institutions in the
States of America is founded on personal observation that predictions
uttered to-day by lookers-on on this side of the water may be utterly
falsified by the intelligence brought by the next mail.  A singular
blending of expediency and impulse which pervades the idiosyncrasy of
the American people renders the formation of any judgment as to what
their conduct will be in certain conditions of things very difficult.
One cannot reason in this case according to the ordinary rules of
cause and effect, nor is there a fair chance of calculating results
from combinations of circumstances.  The profound interest with which
we in this country contemplate the situation as it existed at the last
accounts is intensified by an uncertainty more marked than usual, even
in the instance of an internecine quarrel.  On the one hand, much that
has occurred, many minor and less important matters, would seem to
indicate that both parties are laudably loth to put their dispute to
the last arbitrement.  Take, for instance, the circumstances which
accompanied the capture of Fort Sumter.  There has been a disposition
to look at the bloodless nature of the contest which took place on
that occasion from a comicpoint [sic] of view, and much small wit has
been expended on the remarkable fact that a bombardment of forty hours
should have led to no casualty on either side.  It should, however, be
recollected that in the fort there were scarcely a hundred men, who,
if it was a well-constructed fortification, might easily have found
shelter from any ordinary fire.  On the other hand, it would seem that
its defenders, whose object could only have been to establish the
point of honour that pertained to their character, may have been
unwilling to shed the first blood in a contest between men of the same
nation, as well as to avoid the rousing of that retributive spirit in
their adversaries which might have led to their undergoing another
fate than that of marching out as prisoners of war.  In short, we are
willing to give both parties credit for a praiseworthy desire to avoid
that responsibility which would be involved in the direct initiation
of the slaughter and calamities of a civil war.  There are other marks
of hesitancy which might well have been interpreted into a hope that
the moment of extremity was yet distant.  But, if we take the formal
declarations which have now been made on either side, it is not easy
to see how a civil war of the most fearful description can be anything
but a question of time for preparation.  The policy of Mr. Lincoln is
obvious enough.  It was clearly his cue to have all the credit of
forbearance on his side, while at the same time he was enabled to test
the resources of the South and to marshal his own.  It was the
interest of the seceding States rather than his to provoke a hostile
collision, and it needed an overt act of that which he could
technically designate rebellion to justify the Chief Magistrate of the
Republic in calling those whom he as technically could term
well-affected citizens to arms in order to restore federal law and
order.  It is evident that the President never proposed to himself to
take the initiative in an actual contest, and that with this view he
abstained from any attempt to relieve Fort Sumter.  The responsibility
has thus, with some tact, been thrown on the seceders, and the actual
capture and occupation of a stronghold of the Federal Government by
them is at once the origin and the justification of that proclamation
in which the President of that great nation, which has been at once
the wonder and the envy of the world, gives the signal for all the
havoc and misery of that most dire of contests&#x2014;one between men of the
same country and the same race, who, diverging on questions of
principle and prejudice, can find no other adequate settlement of
their difference than that organised and systematic cutting of each
other's throats which is dignified by the name of war.</p>
               <p>Assuming that which we cannot help calling a melancholy
fact&#x2014;namely, the positive, overt reference of the matters in
difference to the issue of a civil war&#x2014;a curious and interesting
inquiry naturally arises, and that is the relative strength and state
of preparation with which each party will enter on the contest at this
moment.  If we may judge from report and their own statements, the
Southern Confederation, at the time <pb n="408"/> when the accounts
were brought by the last mail, had a force which, at least for
purposes of defence, was greatly superior to any army which the North
could bring into the field for purposes of aggression.  No doubt that
the course of events in Carolina and the other seceding States has
tended to give them up to the present time a more demonstrative
appearance.  Their levies of men have been going on, and we have heard
a great deal of the casting of cannon and the manufacture of the
munitions of war.  If they are to have an army at all, they have
already attained to something more than its nucleus; and, as the
Federal Army proper at the disposal of President Lincoln is only some
twelve or fifteen thousand strong, and those much scattered in distant
frontier service, it would seem as if the South would commence the war
with a certain advantage on their side.  Passing by for a moment the
circumstance, by no means unimportant, that the party of the North is
in the possession of the Federal Navy, and would thus have the command
of the seaboard, Mr. Lincoln can have, and has had, recourse only to
the calling out of the Militia, on which, in the case of foreign war,
every possible reliance is to be placed.  The question then is, will
the demand which he has made for the force necessary to carry on any
warlike operations which he may contemplate now, or hereafter find
necessary, be responded to.  We are assured, on very competent
authority, that it will.  It is confidently stated that the spirit of
the North is now equally pronounced with that of the South&#x2014;that there
will be no difficulty in raising any force that may be required for an
immediate campaign.  The accounts which have been received go far to
justify this opinion.  The State of New York offers 30,000 men instead
of the 13,000 which was asked as her quota; and we hear that even the
so-called peace community of Pennsylvania has declared its readiness
to contribute no less than 100,000 fighting men.  We must, therefore,
come to the painful conclusion that neither inclination nor means is
wanting for the commencement and the carrying on of the impending
struggle.</p>
               <p>The secession of the border States, and of Virginia
especially, will necessarily increase the difficulties which Mr.
Lincoln has to encounter; and, admitting in their fullest extent the
material advantages which are possessed by the North, those
difficulties are formidable enough.  As regards those pecuniary
resources which have been emphatically designated the sinews of war,
there is probably little or no comparison between the two parties.  In
the South the main dependence appears to rest on a duty of a cent per
pound which has been imposed on the staple commodity, cotton, and a
loan which has been already raised.  Another recourse to this latter
expedient, and also to voluntary contributions, will be found
necessary, we suppose, if the contest assumes those dimensions to
which, unhappily, there is every prospect that it will reach.  The
question then arises whether the means of the seceding States are
equal, not to a drain of money merely, but to an actual and necessary
supply.  We are assured on good authority that much that has been said
of the wealth of the South is in a manner an exaggeration, or, at
least, that riches there do not take the decided shape of ready money
to the extent which has been supposed.  On the other hand, the
volunteer spirit of the North embraces both men and money, and the
contributions of the latter can be counted in current coin.  The power
which Mr. Lincoln possesses, and of which it appears he is about to
avail himself, of blockading the Southern ports, must have a material
if not an overwhelming influence on the pecuniary resources of his
opponents.</p>
               <p>Everything, however, tends to point to a struggle
of the most energetic and unyielding description when once it has
actually begun.  Notwithstanding some inequities of strength, we know
enough of the spirit of all Americans, when their blood is up and
their impulsive feelings thoroughly enlisted in a cause, to be sure
that conquest, in the strict sense of the term, of the seceding States
is just an impossibility.  It may happen that the power of the North
may be so far predominant after a time as to enable its forces to
devastate the territory of its adversaries, although even that is not
by any means a proximate event.  It may be that ere long a slave
insurrection will be added to the difficulties which the South will
have to encounter, and who shall say what may be the consequences of
such a thing?  But that the revolting communities will ever be brought
by coercive measures into the federation which we have hitherto known
as the United States is about as likely as the return to their
allegiance to England of her then colonies in North America was after
the Declaration of Independence.  Unless some miracle of compromise be
performed, the world must henceforth expect to see two moderate
Republics established on that continent where for many years it has
been accustomed to contemplate the growth of a nation which bade fair
to be stupendous in its greatness.</p>
               <p>Apart from many causes
which would render it the obvious interest of this country to lament
the political and social severance of the States of America, there are
peculiar reasons why we Englishmen should look with pain and sorrow on
a civil war between men of a kindred race with ourselves.  We have
ourselves, indeed, gone through the fiery ordeal of many civil wars;
but in some way or other, directly or indirectly, these contests have
had a bearing on the attainment of these liberties which we at present
enjoy; and, if we now look back with sadness on the brothers' blood
which has been spilled in our land, at least we have the consolation
that it has not been shed in vain, for it has tended only to the
consolidation of our empire and the building up of our constitutional
rights on a sure foundation.  It is to be feared that the Americans
will have no such retrospect in the history of these events.  This
internecine contest has been in a certain sense provoked by an idea
which did not need an appeal to the sword; and if, as we believe, it
will result in the disruption of a great commonwealth, even if it
should not tend to weaken or destroy the liberties of the citizens of
either of the contending communities&#x2014;which, at least, it may put in
peril&#x2014;it cannot in any case be otherwise than a calamity to all
concerned in it, and a subject of regret, and indeed of grief, to all
thinking men in the old country.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The startling news was received
late on Thursday se'nnight of the bombardment and surrender of Fort
Sumter on the 13th of April. We were enabled to give in the greater
part of our last Impression the telegraphic summary of the proceedings
at Charleston, and up to the time of our going to press with this
week's Number no detailed account had come to hand.  The cannonading
was commenced by General Beauregard at four o'clock on the morning of
the 12th of April, and Major Anderson vigorously returned the fire.
Hostilities continued until the following day, when the fort appears
to have sustained so much damage as to render its further defence
hopeless, and Major Anderson then surrendered.  Some steamers sent to
relieve the fort were outside the harbour, but took no part in the
conflict.  No lives were lost on either side; in fact, one despatch
states that no one was even hurt. Major Anderson and his men left
Charleston on the 15th in the steamer Baltic for New York.  The
general character of the operations as gathered from the Charleston
telegrams, which are, however, little to be relied on, has been thus
indicated:&#x2014;All the proceedings at Charleston were carried on much as
a cricket-match or an eight-oar race might take place in this country.
 The highest courtesy seems to have been shown on both sides.  The
ladies turned out to grace the contest.  A good shot from Fort Sumter
was as much applauded as a good shot from Fort Moultrie.  When the
American flag was shot away General Beauregard sent Major Anderson
another to fight under; when the fort was found to be on fire the
polite enemy, who had with such intense energy laboured to excite the
conflagration, offered an equally energetic assistance to put it out.
When the dispossessed enemy passed through the streets of Charleston
the cheering of the people was frantic.  The only indignation felt
throughout the affair was at the conduct of the American flotilla,
which kept outside, and did not come into harbour and take part in the
fray.  The Southerners resented this as an act of treachery towards
their favourite enemy, Major Anderson.  The courtesies, indeed, were
more fatal than the hostilities, for, whereas no life was destroyed by
the guns fired in anger, two men were killed and four wounded by the
peaceful salute fired afterwards.</p>
               <p>The news of the capture of
Fort Sumter had naturally occasioned intense excitement at Washington
and throughout the country.  There was a feeling that the safety of
the Federal capital itself would soon be menaced, and preparations
were being made for its defence.</p>
               <p>President Lincoln has issued
a proclamation calling out the militia of the several States of the
Union, to the number of seventy-five thousand, and announcing that
this force will probably be employed in the recapture of the forts
which have been seized by the Southern revolutionists.  He likewise
summons an extra session of Congress, but the senators and
representatives are not to assemble till the 4th of July next&#x2014;the
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.  The proclamation
treats the Secessionists as rebels, and commands all persons who are
in arms against the United States to disperse within twenty days.  The
document, which is dated the 15th of April, was signed by Mr. Lincoln,
and countersigned by Mr. Seward.</p>
               <p>On the previous day Mr.
Lincoln received the Commissioners appointed by the Virginia
Convention to ascertain his intentions; and, in answer to their
inquiries, he expressed his determination not only to hold all the
forts now in possession of the Government, but to retake those which
have been captured, "and, in any event, to the best of his ability,
repel force by force."</p>
               <p>The Northern States, we are told,
responded enthusiastically to the President's call, New York having
voted 30,000 men and 3,000,000 dollars.  Volunteers are freely
offering their services.</p>
               <p>But, on the other hand, the
Governors of Kentucky, North Carolina, and Missouri have refused to
supply any troops; and Virginia has seceded formally from the Union.
The Southern Confederacy is vigorously preparing for hostilities on a
large scale; for President Jefferson Davis has published a
proclamation authorising the issue of letters of marque&#x2014;a measure
which will fill with alarm the shipowners of New York and New England;
and we are told that the Montgomery Government will call out 150,000
volunteers.</p>
               <p>Extensive preparations continued to be made for
the defence of Washington against any attack of the Secessionists, and
Federal troops were assembling there.  The Federal squadron, having on
board Major Anderson and his garrison, had sailed from Charleston for
New York.</p>
               <p>The tenour of the American advices brought by the
Canadian on Wednesday is such as to destroy any hope which remained
that a civil war on a great scale could be averted.  President Lincoln
has issued a proclamation declaring all the ports of the seceded
States in a state of blockade.  North Carolina has seized the Federal
forts and arsenals within the State, and has thus seceded as
practically, if not as formally, as South Carolina itself.  One of the
first acts of the Virginians after hoisting the Southern flag was to
assail the Federal arsenal at Harper's Ferry; and the Federal
Commissioners, not having sufficient force to defend the place,
destroyed the buildings and stores, and fled into Pennsylvania, with
the loss of three of their men.  At Norfolk the Virginians attempted
to block up the harbour so as to prevent the egress of the Federal
vessels from the Navy-yard; but they were compelled, we are told, to
remove the obstructions by the vigorous conduct of the Captain of a
United States' ship of war, who threatened to level the town with his
guns if they persisted in their endeavour.  In Maryland there has been
a sanguinary collision between the Northerners and the Southerners at
Baltimore.  A regiment of Massachusetts volunteers, on its way to
Washington for the defence of the Federal capital, was assailed by a
Secessionist mob in the streets of Baltimore.  In the fierce affray
which followed eleven men were killed, and many were wounded.  About
5000 Federal troops and militia have been assembled at Washington, and
reinforcements are constantly arriving.  All the bridges have been
destroyed between Baltimore and Washington.  If we may believe the
<title>New York Evening Post</title>, President Jefferson Davis, at
the head of the Southern Confederacy's army, was within twenty-four
hours' march of Washington. Fort Pickens had been relieved by the
Federal squadron, which had increased its garrison to 800 men; but the
reinforcements seem to have been landed without any hostilities with
the Southerners, under General Bragg.  All the Slave States&#x2014;as we are
assured, and no doubt with truth&#x2014;are "arming for the defence of the
South;" and the whole of the Montgomery Government's loan of
15,000,000 dollars is said to have been subscribed.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The United States' Army</hi>.&#x2014;The present strength of the
Army is 18,122 men.  It consists of 19 regiments&#x2014;10 regiments of
infantry, averaging 10 companies of 70 men each; 4 of artillery,
averaging 12 companies of about 50 men each; 1 of mounted rifles, 2 of
cavalry, and 2 of dragoons&#x2014;each of the latter numbering 10 companies
of about 60 men; or about 198 in all.  Of these, notwithstanding the
excitement created by the concentration of about half a regiment at
the national capital, over 160 companies are stationed in the distant
regions of Key West, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, Texas, New Mexico,
California, Oregon, and other places.  Regiments serving on those
stations have 74 men to a company, instead of 64, so that were the
entire army located in them it would consist of 17,549, "total
enlisted," and 1886 aggregate.  It is impossible to estimate
accurately the number of officers now in the service, as no official
list, deducting the resignation[s], has been published.  There have
been, however, some 1200 commissions gazetted, and there must be over
1000 epauletted gentlemen now on the roll.  Each regiment has a
certain number of officers allotted to it, which varies according to
circumstances.  The dragoons, for instance, of whom we have 2
regiments, numbering each about 600 men, have 1 colonel, 1
lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, 10 captains, 11 first lieutenants, and
12 second-lieutenants&#x2014;74 officers all told; the two regiments of
calvary (600 men), 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel, 2 majors, 10
captains, and 22 lieutenants&#x2014;68 [sic] in all; the mounted rifle
regiment, the same number of men and general staff, and 23
lieutenants&#x2014;37 in all; the four regiments of artillery (each about
700 men), 4 general officers, 12 captains, and 38 lieutenants&#x2014;216 in
all; the 10 regiments of infantry (each 700 men), 4 general officers,
10 captains, and 20 lieutenants; and so on.&#x2014;<title>New York

HON. A. DUDLEY MANN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As is well known, commissioners have
been sent by the Southern States of America to visit the different
Courts of Europe on a mission, the object of which is obvious.  Of
these Mr. A. Dudley Mann is one.  This gentleman, who is descended on
both sides from English families, which emigrated to Virginia between
1660 and 1675, was born in that State on the 26th of April, 1805.
About twenty years ago he entered the diplomatic service of the United
States.  In 1845 he was appointed Special Plenipotentiary to Hanover,
Oldenburg, and the two Duchies of Mecklenburg, for the purpose of
negotiating commercial treaties, the objects of which were the removal
of transit dues on American products, and a large reduction of import
duties in the States composing the Zollverein on tobacco, which were
effected.  In 1847 he was accredited to all the German Governments
except Prussia.  In 1849 he was appointed Commissioner to Hungry; and
in 1850 he was appointed Special Minister to Switzerland, between
which Republic and the United States he opened relations and
negotiated a treaty of friendship, commerce, and extradition.  In
1853, after the election of General Franklin Pearce [sic] to the
Presidency of the United States, Mr. Mann was, without any
solicitation on his part, appointed Assistant Secretary of State, an
office then for the first time created.  In 1855 he resigned that
office, and since that he has devoted himself to the development of
the material interests of the Southern States.  His antecedents thus
in every way qualified him for the discharge of the duties of the
important office which has now been conferred upon him.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">LOADING COTTON ON THE ALABAMA
RIVER.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Our</hi> Number of April 13 contained some Illustrations
of the methods of conveying cotton in India to the ports of shipment;
and we follow up the subject&#x2014;of special interest at the present
time&#x2014;by giving this week two companion Engravings illustrating the
singular manner in which cotton-bales are sometimes taken on board
steam-boats in the Alabama River, in Alabama, one of the seven
Southern Confederate States of America.  On the Mississippi the bales
are merely dragged and trundled over a plank on board ship. But on the
Alabama, the banks of which are frequently high and steep, a more
dashing style of embarkation is adopted.  Of our two Engravings the
first represents the "shoot" <hi rend="italic">in extenso</hi>, the other the mouth, whence
the cotton-bales are projected on board the steam-boat. Mr. F. Bellew,
the gentleman to whom we are indebted for our illustrations, supplies
the following particulars of the manner in which cotton is taken on
board the steam-boats that ply on the Alabama:&#x2014;"It was on a dark
night in February that I jumped off the top of a high bank at
Montgomery on to the Magnolia steam-boat, then lying on the turgid
bosom of the Alabama River, waiting for passengers going to Mobile.
There were many passengers, and plenty of negroes about, but
apparently no officers.  The superb cabins were brilliantly lighted,
and huge volumes of smoke were careering out of the double funnels.
Having collected our luggage and seen an elderly clergyman break his
collarbone in attempting to leap on board, I went to bed, slept, and
awoke next morning to find myself eighty miles down the river.  Going
on deck, I was not a little surprised to observe our vessel in the act
of violating all preconceived notions of aquatic law, by going head
first into a partially-submerged forest, crashing and breaking through
the young trees with high-pressure indifference: she was merely going
to the bank to ship a few bales of cotton, which being done, she
backed out and went on her way snorting, every now and then repeating
the operation, like a big duck seeking food among the sedges.
Sometimes the Magnolia would extract a feed of the staple from the
most unpromising jungle; at another time an open clearing decorated
with a pineshed and a few sleepy niggers would afford a meal.  But the
grand repast of our panting vessel was to come.  In a certain part of
the river, banked by wood-clad mountains, we suddenly slackened our
speed opposite a long shed running from the water's edge to the hill's
summit.  The planter, in order to get his produce from the height
above to the means of transport below, had constructed an extensive
slide, about three hundred and fifty feet in length, and about four
feet six inches wide, made of longitudinal planks, with a raised guard
on each side to preserve the bales from slipping off in their descent.
 Parallel to the slide ran a flight of steps, with whole being covered
over.  Our vessel ran its nose boldly into the shore; a wide gangboard
was thrown to the foot of the shoot, making a complete connection with
our lower deck, where the busy hands had already constructed a species
of barricade of cotton-bales to receive the shock of their coming
brother bale.  And now the process of loading commenced.  At a given
signal from below a thousand-pound package of the staple was started
at the top of the slide, two hundred and fifty feet perpendicular
above the level of the water.  Slowly it moved at first, but, gaining
momentum as it proceeded, the pace quickened&#x2014;quicker, quicker,
quicker&#x2014;till at last it fell like a thunderbolt on the deck, knocking
the bales of the barricade in every direction.  In one moment a dozen
black fellows were upon the new arrival, dragging it out of the way
with instruments resembling boothooks, or busying themselves with
reconstructing the barricade. The sable workmen having scrambled to
places of  safety, and the signal "All right!" given, another
thousand-pounder came thundering on deck, shaking our big ship from
stem to stern, till every beam and rafter trembled to the uttermost
end of its two hundred and fifty feet of length.  The effect was
absolutely terrific, and required some nerve merely to contemplate.
If a man gets in the way, as sometimes happens, he is crushed like a
fly under the hand of a coalheaver. However, no accident happened on
the present occasion.  The Magnolia received her  fifty shocks, packed
her cargo neatly round the boiler, and steamed onward."</p>

               <p>An American company of strolling singers, called the Alleghanians,
gave in December last, in the Island of Hewey, one of Cook's
Archipelago, a grand concert, which was attended by the King of the
island, Makea. More than 2000 tickets were sold, and the receipts were
78 pigs, 98 turkeys, 116 fowls, 16,000 cocoanuts [sic], 5700
pineapples, 418 bushels of bananas, 600 pumpkins, and 2700 oranges.
It required a day and a half to embark all these articles.  The
concert consisted of a vocal quatuor, and of several morceaux executed
by means of bells of different sizes&#x2014;from the dimensions of a bucket
to those of a thimble. The savages who composed the auditory listened
open-mouthed, and remained motionless from admiration when the march
from "Norma" was performed.  At the end of the sitting one of the
principal personages present rose, and gravely complimented the
performers by saying, " We shall never forget you!"&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Entr' Acte</hi>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The latest news from America
is of a most serious character. The hostile feeling between the
contending States is daily becoming more intense, and there is no
longer any hopes of averting a civil war of a desperate nature.</p>
               <p>Washington was in danger of falling into the hands of the
Secessionists, six thousand of whom were in the neighbourhood
threatening an attack.  The Government had thrown up defences around
the principal public buildings, and large bodies of troops were being
dispatched to its defence from New York.  Four New York regiments have
arrived at Washington.  The telegraphic communication between New York
and Washington had been cut off by the order of the Government in
order to prevent their plans from being made too soon public.  The
Governor of New York has made a call for twenty-one additional
regiments.  A mass meeting in support of the Government was held at
New York on the 22nd ult.  It was a demonstration such as was never
previously equalled in the history of the United States.  A committee
of twenty-five was appointed to collect funds and to transact other
necessary business.  In many places the municipalities are voluntarily
taxing themselves, and many wealthy individuals are making liberal
contributions towards defraying the expenses of the war.</p>
               <p>In
all the Northern and Western States the most enthusiastic resolution
to support President Lincoln is manifested.  New York rings with the
noise of armaments, every effort being made to forward troops to
Washington, and to provide vessels for their conveyance for the
defence of northern commerce, and for the blockade of the southern
ports.  In Boston, too, the utmost efforts are made to fit out a
squadron at the Navy Yard, and to supply men and stores for the
service of the Union.</p>
               <p>The people of Kentucky are said to have
declared their resolution to remain neutral; and in Missouri, although
the Governor refused to supply the regiments demanded by President
Lincoln, volunteers are freely enlisting in St Louis for the service
of the Washington Government.  The Governor of Delaware has responded
to President Lincoln's call for troops.</p>
               <p>In Texas warlike
preparations are actively progressing, and it is said that the
remaining United States' troops will not be permitted to depart, but
will be detained as prisoners of war.  It is asserted that a steamer,
named the Matagorda, has been armed by the Texans, and has gone to sea
for the purpose of intercepting the Aspinwall and New York steamer,
which probably has a freight of some two million dollars in gold.</p>
               <p>The steam-ship Star of the West, which was lately chartered by the
Washington Government as a transport, has been captured by the
Southerners, and carried into a southern port.  Some rumours allege
that several southern privateers have sailed, or are about to put to
sea; but, on the other hand, it is affirmed that President Jefferson
Davis had determined not to issue letters of marque before the 1st of
May, the day fixed for the meeting of the Southern Congress.</p>
               <p>The United States' Navy Yard at Gosport, in Norfolk harbour, and
eleven men-of-war lying there in ordinary, have been burned by the
Federal officers, who destroyed them in order to prevent the ships and
stores from falling into the hands of the Virginia Secessionists.
Among the ships destroyed are a three-decker, two two-deckers, two
large sailing-frigates, and the large steam-frigate Merrimac.</p>
               <p>Maryland we may now presume will join the Secessionists.  Baltimore
is described as being in the hands of the mob, and a reign of terror
in the ascendant.  All the railway bridges between Philadelphia and
Baltimore have been burned by the people of Maryland.</p>
               <p>From
Virginia comes a report, among others, that an attack on Fort Monroe
(of which we shall give an Engraving next week) was contemplated.</p>
               <p>Fort Smith, in Arkansas, has been taken by the State troops.  The
Confederate flag has been hoisted on the fort.</p>
               <p>Altogether the
state of affairs in the Republic presents a most gloomy and painful
picture.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">MAJOR ANDERSON.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Major Anderson</hi>, of
the United States' Army, lately in command of Fort Sumter, was born in
Kentucky in September, 1805.  At the age of fifteen he entered the
Military Academy at West Point, and graduated in 1825.  He joined the
army with the rank of Second Lieutenant of the 2nd and subsequently of
the 3rd Artillery.  In 1832 he was Inspector-General of the Illinois
Volunteers in the Black Hawk War&#x2014;Mr. Lincoln, the President, being a
Captain of those volunteers. In 1833 he received his commission as
First Lieutenant, and became Instructor and Inspector at West Point,
the great military academy of the United States.  This post he held
for four years, during which period he collected the material for his
work on artillery, which is now regarded as an authority on the
subject.  In 1838, for gallantry in the Florida War, he was made
Brevet Captain, and soon afterwards joined General Scott as
Aide-de-Camp.  In October, 1841, Anderson received his commission as
Captain in his regiment.  In March, 1847, he was with the 3rd Regiment
of Artillery in the army of General Scott, and took part in the siege
of Vera Cruz&#x2014;being one of the officers to whom was intrusted, by
General Bankhead, the command of the batteries.  This duty he
performed with signal skill and gallantry, and he continued with the
army until its triumphal entry into the city of Mexico in September
following.  During the operations in the valley of Mexico he was
attached to the brigade of General Garland, which formed a part of
General Worth's division.   In the attack on El Molino del Rey, on
September 8, where he was wounded very severely, his conduct was the
theme of especial praise on the part of his superior officers.  For
his gallant services in this action he was promoted to the rank of
Brevet Major; and on October 5, 1857, he was made Major of the 1st
Artillery, a position which he now holds.  All last summer Major
Anderson was occupied as a member of the commission appointed to
inspect the United States' Military Academy at West Point.  Major
Anderson, at the close of last year, took the command of Fort
Moultrie, which, however, for military reasons, he abandoned, throwing
himself and his few troops into Fort Sumter.  The facts of his stout
defence and of his enforced surrender of this latter fort, are too
fresh in our readers' memory to require recapitulation.  The following
despatch from Major Anderson to the United States' Secretary of War
will, however, be of interest:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>Sir,&#x2014;Having defended Fort
Sumter until our quarters were entirely burned, the main gates
destroyed by fire, the gorge wall seriously injured, the magazine
surrounded by flames, and its doors closed from the effects of heat,
and three cartridges of powder only being available, and no provisions
but pork remaining, I accepted  the terms of evacuation offered by
General Beauregard, being the same offered by him on the 11th inst.,
prior to the commencement of hostilities; and marched out of the fort
on Sunday afternoon, the 14th inst., with colours flying and drums
beating, bringing away the company and private property, and saluting
my flag with fifty guns.   <lb/>(Signed),</p> 	<p
rend="center">ROBERT ANDERSON,<lb/>Major, 1st Artillery.
               </p>
               <p>Major Anderson landed at the Battery, New York,
on the 18th ult., and was received by an immense crowd.  His carriage
was surrounded by the people, who expressed in vehement cheers their
congratulations.  He was followed by an immense throng through
Broadway to the Brevoort House, where he joined his wife.</p>
               <p>Of
Major Anderson's physique a writer who seems to know him well
says:&#x2014;"In personal appearance he is about five feet nine inches in
height, his figure is well-set and soldierly, his hair is thin and
turning to iron grey, his complexion swarthy, his eye dark and
intelligent, his nose prominent and well formed.  A stranger would
read in his air and appearance determination and an exaction of what
was due to him.  In intercourse he is very courteous, and his rich
voice and abundant gesticulations go well together.  He is always
agreeable and gentlemanly, firm and dignified."</p>
               <p>Major
Anderson is connected by marriage with Mr. Longworth, the millionaire
of Cincinnati, in which city the Major's two brothers, both lawyers
and men of position, reside.</p>

               <p>. . . The most important exchange of question and
answer has been upon the American difficulty, and its aspect towards
ourselves; and Lord John Russell has stated, although his reply is
given with a certain reservation, that he considers that the South is
sufficiently strong to be regarded as a "belligerent," as
distinguished from a rebel, and that we shall recognise no blockade by
the North, except an "effective" one.  The more difficult ancillary
question as to right of search will keep for a short time, but may
have to be more promptly solved than is expected.</p>
               <p>Up to our
writing the American news has comprised details of the most alarming
character, but no great collision is reported.  The destruction of
several of the finest ships of the Federal Navy, in order to prevent
their falling into the hands of the South, is the largest operation
that has yet taken place; but the rapid arming on both sides, and the
intense feeling in the North, whence volunteers of the best character
are pouring down in thousands, and where pecuniary aid is flowing in a
torrent into the Treasury, seem to promise&#x2014;let us rather say to
threaten&#x2014;events of a sadder character.  It would seem that some
suggestion of English mediation had been made, but only to be
scornfully rejected, all interference, and especially that of a
monarchy, being held to be intolerable.  It is well simply to record
the various phases of this portentous struggle, but it is hardly
possible that the next telegram should not throw all present
speculation out of date.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE SECESSION OF VIRGINIA, AND THE AMERICAN CIVIL
WAR.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> new secession movement in the Border Slave
States, which may be called the second chapter of the American
Revolution of 1861, has been followed so instantaneously by the
commencement of a civil war, the destruction of arsenals and
navy-yards, and the mustering of hosts on a scale unprecedented in the
history of the New World, as to blur to the eyes of the casual reader
the logical sequence of events, and completely to overslough some
important aspects of the crisis.  We saw the revolution break out in
December, rage triumphantly during January, and carry off the seven
Cotton-growing States of the Union; then, during February and March,
subside; and, lastly, in April break out afresh in the very States
which had just overcome it.  At first sight this seems anomalous, but
the anomaly yields to a close scrutiny of the transactions of the last
three months.  That scrutiny will bring into relief the governing fact
that the immediate cause of the revolutionary movement in the Border
Slave States in April is quite distinct from the occasion which led to
the secession of the seven Confederate States in December and January
last.  South Carolina and her six sisters exercised their alleged
constitutional right of secession because the executive department of
the Federal Government was about to fall into the hands of a party
which professed a carefully-limited and very moderate hostility to the
extension of slavery.  The Border States, on the other hand, bore Mr.
Lincoln's election meekly, but the march of events immediately
thereafter subjected their loyalty to a succession of new and
unlooked-for tests. The withdrawal from Washington of the senators and
representatives of the seceding States created a state of things which
had not been contemplated by the adhering Slaves States.  It gave the
majority in both Houses of the Federal Legislature to the party which
represented the prevailing ideas and interests of the Northern people.
 Nor was that majority over scrupulous in taking advantage of its
unexpected ascendancy in Congress.  The enactment of the Morrill
Tariff against the united opposition of all the Southern senators and
representatives remaining in the Capitol was certainly the very
reverse of conciliatory.  The "Crittenden Compromise" and the other
propositions favoured by the Union men of the eight adhering Slave
States were rejected by the Republicans, who, indeed, could not assent
to them without abandoning the very principles which called their
party into existence, which animated them under defeat, and finally
led them to victory.  All this while the Secession leaders of the
Border States, among whom were most of the well-known and long-trusted
Coryphaei of Southern opinion&#x2014;Mason and Hunter, Breckinridge and
Clingman, Pryor and Floyd&#x2014;were indefatigable in inflaming the public
mind of their States, so as to precipitate it [sic] into a policy of
secession and revolution.  Circumstances favoured their undertaking,
they were able to point to the rejection of all offers of compromise,
to the injustice of the Morrill Tariff, and to the permanent
alteration of the equilibrium in Congress in consequence of the
withdrawal of the representatives of the seceding States.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, their efforts were at first signally frustrated.  The
people were more conservative, more "submissive," than their leaders.
In Delaware and Maryland the Union party were so strong that it was
not thought necessary to take a plebiscitum on the subject; in
Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, and Arkansas
the people voted secession down by large majorities.  But, although
they repudiated secession as a <hi rend="italic">policy</hi>, they did not repudiate it as a
<hi rend="italic">principle</hi>.  The Legislatures and extraordinary Conventions of these
States laid it down that a sovereign State had a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to secede
whenever it saw fit, and, consequently, that any attempt on the part
of the Federal Government to levy war on the seceded States would be a
tyrannical and unconstitutional abuse of power.  Such was the position
of things in the adhering Slave States when Mr. Lincoln came into
office on the 4th of March, and such it continued for another month.
The United and Confederate States maintained a sort of armed truce;
Mr. Lincoln's and Mr. Seward's well-known aversion to bloodshed
favoured its prolongation; the Cabinet threw out the idea of the
evacuation of Fort Sumter as a "feeler," gilding the pill with the
assurance of the "strategic necessity" of the act.  How long the
Unionists of the eight adhering Slave States could have maintained
their ascendancy over the Secessionists, had the truce been prolonged
and broadened into a peaceful recognition of the independence of the
Confederate States, it is bootless now to inquire, for two new
elements were destined to enter into the combination which immediately
broke up the tacit understanding which existed between Mr. Lincoln,
the Unionists of the Border States, and Mr. Jefferson Davis.  Those
elements were the Morrill Tariff and the public opinion of the
Northern <pb n="456"/> States.  The former ill-timed piece of
legislation came into operation on April 1, and the Northern
importers, on paying the higher scale of duties, lost no time in
complaining that the lower rate was still in force at Savannah,
Mobile, and New Orleans.  "Either," said they, "enforce your tariff
impartially, South as well as North, or recognise the independence of
the Confederate States and plant your custom-houses along the new
Southern frontier line of the United States."  The justice of this
claim was not to be gainsaid, but the manifestations of public opinion
at the North were still more influential in forcing Mr. Lincoln
(probably against his own desire) to pursue a more energetic course
towards the Seceders.  The Northerners revolted at the idea of
abandoning Fort Sumter; they began to ask wherein Mr. Lincoln was an
improvement on Mr. Buchanan.  They demanded that the garrisons of
Forts Sumter and Pickens should be relieved at any cost.  Before this
imperious demonstration of popular feeling the Cabinet of Washington
gave way.  On the 8th of April it became known that a squadron had
left New York with sealed orders. The bombardment and capitulation of
Fort Sumter ensued on the 12th and 13th.  Mr. Lincoln's proclamation
calling for 75,000 men "to suppress illegal combinations, and to cause
the laws to be duly executed," was issued on the 15th.  The response
which the Northern people gave to this proclamation is one of the many
very remarkable politica [sic] events of this century.  Before the
week was over Massachusetts troops were fighting their way through
Baltimore to the Federal capital, and a blockade of the Southern ports
had been proclaimed.  Now, if ever, was the time for the Border Slave
States to enforce their views of constitutional law, or to submit
without reserve to the construction put upon the Constitution by the
Northerners.  The choice of Virginia was soon made.  She seceded; but
it is important to remember that the occasion for this act was not, as
in the case of the seven original seceders, the election of Mr.
Lincoln, but the, in her view, unconstitutional action of the
President in making war on his own authority, and without the consent
of Congress, on the seceded States. The secession ordinance of
Virginia has not yet been published; but when the injunction of
secrecy is withdrawn the world will see that the revolution in
Virginia stands on better constitutional and legal grounds than
revolutions generally do.  In Europe a legal and constitutional
revolution is a paradox.  It has been reserved for the ambitious and
innovating politicians of the New World to make such a novel
contribution to political science.</p>
               <p>Maryland is now the chief
theatre of the war; and it is a singular instance of the conspicuous
injustice of revolutions that she, the most conservative, humane, and
loyal of the Slave States, should have to bear the brunt of this great
struggle between the two sections of the late Union.  She suffers for
sins not her own.  For the last twenty years she has held herself
aloof from the aggressive policy of the Southern ultras, and has
steadily advocated the cause of peace and quietness.  One of her
senators voted against the repeal of the Missouri compromise; and, by
casting her suffrage for Mr. Fillmore, in 1856, when all her Southern
sisters voted for Mr. Buchanan, she declared her neutrality in the
most emphatic manner.  Unlike all the other Slave States, she has
permitted the growth of a large free-coloured  population in her
midst.  This class of her inhabitants, which in 1790 numbered only
3000, had grown to 90,000 in 1860; while her slaves, which were
103,000 in 1790, had fallen to 87,000 in 1860.  Her aggregate
population is 687,000, so that her slave element only amounts to one
in eight of her people.  While the other Southern States have of late
years passed measures proscribing free people of colour, the white men
of Maryland, who, if free blacks are a nuisance, had more reason to
complain than the people of any other Southern State, always refused
to pass any Acts limiting their right to settle or hold property in
that State.  Recurring to recent political events, we observe that the
loyalty of her present Governor (Mr. Hicks), in refusing to call a
special Session of the Legislature when requested to do so by the
Secessionists of his State, received the unbounded praise of Northern
Governors, Legislatures, and Journals.  When President Lincoln
recently called for 75,000 troops the Governors of Delaware and
Maryland were the only two Southern Governors who responded favourably
to the demand.  Unfortunately for the peace of this Conservative
State, she lay on the highway between the Northern States and the city
of Washington.  The sight of Massachusetts soldiers passing through
the streets of Baltimore, the chief city of Maryland, aroused the
resentments of a mob of road-paviors, and the first blood of the
revolution was shed in this city.  The people of Baltimore and the
Governor of the State then demanded that no more Federal troops should
pass through Maryland.  This was equivalent to a request that
Washington should be evacuated, as that city can only be approached
through Virginia or Maryland.  President Lincoln, actuated by a
feeling of humanity, which certainly has not increased his popularity
in the North, consented to bring the troops to Washington via
Annapolis, so as to avoid Baltimore, but, to the reiterated complaint
that this modified order too was in derogation of the rights of
Maryland as a Sovereign State after her Governor had forbidden the
passage of any more Federal troops through her borders, the President
made the following characteristic reply:&#x2014;"They (the troops) can't
come under the earth, and they can't fly over it, and, mathematically,
they must come across it.  Why, Sir, those Carolinians are now
crossing Virginia, and, hang me, what can I do?"  The good sense of
this dictum is very apparent, but its constitutionality is extremely
doubtful.  Furthermore, Annapolis, the capital of Maryland, is now
garrisoned by Federal troops, and a Federal army of occupation keeps
open the line of communication between that city and Washington.  The
Maryland Legislature, which assembled on the 26th ult., was summoned
to meet at Frederick City, as Annapolis is under the control of New
York and Massachusetts volunteers.  A late arrival brings the
intelligence that that body, notwithstanding the irritating
circumstances under which it met, declared in favour of the Union by a
majority of fifty-three against thirteen.  It is to be hoped this
decision will turn aside the wrath of the Northerners, and that the
war-cloud will discharge its lightning elsewhere than on Maryland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="italic">Inter arma leges silent!</hi>  Amid the passions
roused by the first scenes of civil war the United States'
Constitution falls to the ground.  But if the restraints of
constitutional law are infringed in one instance, why not in others?
This is how the Northerners are now arguing.  They are complaining of
the "imbecility" of President Lincoln, as they complained of the
"imbecility" of his predecessor.  "Let the troops be sent through
Baltimore, and by no other route.  If resistance be made let Baltimore
be laid in ashes.  Why not seize or disperse the members of the
Maryland Legislature?  Why nor invade Virginia, seize Richmond, and
hang a hundred of the notorious traitors who nestle there?  Why not
send a flotilla down the Mississippi and chastise New Orleans
herself?"  Schemes yet more extreme and revolutionary are openly
canvassed by journals like the <title>New York Times</title>, which a
few weeks ago prided themselves on being conservative on the question
of slavery. It is intimated that the love of the Union is so strong
with the Northern masses that, rather than see it destroyed, in their
desperation they will make war against the Seceders a <hi rend="italic">war of liberation to the African race</hi>.  Will Mr.
Lincoln retract all his solemn pledges, and enlarge the objects and
strategy of the war, in obedience to the vindictive clamour of
Northern public opinion?  The humane and upright character of the
man&#x2014;a man little prone to follow the multitude to do what, in his
opinion, was evil&#x2014;warrants us in believing that he will confine the
war within the limits admittedly imposed upon him by the Constitution
of the Federal Government.  But if he does take such a stand, and hold
to it firmly, we may expect to hear him denounced by his supporters as
bitterly as was Mr. Buchanan, who denied that the Constitution gave
the President any power whatever to act against a seceding State.</p>
               <p>We propose to continue from time to time, in another part of this
Journal, the discussion of those questions of permanent interest to
the jurist, the historian, and the politician which are brought
forward by this remarkable revolution. Among other topics which will
receive consideration are the State right of secession, and the
influence of physical geography in determining the extent of the
disintegration which the late United States are destined to suffer in
consequence of the events which began to operate last winter, and are
still passing before our eyes.</p>

               </p>
               <p>No further
collision between the hostile parties is announced.  Telegraphic
communication has been restored between New York and Washington, and
the Federal capital was believed to be safe from any attack by the
Secessionists, there being 18,000 men in Washington.</p>
               <p>Warlike
preparations were, however, continued with the same activity, both in
the Northern and in the Southern States. President Jefferson Davis, in
his message to the Southern Congress, which assembled at Montgomery on
the 29th ult., declared that the South would resist to the direst
extremities the attempt to subjugate her.  Governor Letcher has issued
a proclamation ordering the Virginian volunteers to remain at home
until they should be summoned by the State authorities, and he has
declared to President Lincoln his resolution not to permit the troops
of the Southern Confederacy to traverse Virginia for the purpose of
attacking Washington.  In Maryland, too, the Secessionist excitement
seems to have somewhat abated, for the Union flag was said to be
displayed over the Baltimore Custom House, and a "test vote" of the
Maryland Legislature showed a majority of thirty-eight against
secession.  In Tennessee, however, the State Convention was reported
to have passed an ordinance for the secession of the State.  President
Lincoln had issued a proclamation ordering the blockade of the ports
of North Carolina and Virginia, and has informed Governor Letcher that
Federal troops would immediately attack Norfolk and Richmond if the
Secessionists should make any military movements to the north of
Richmond.  The North Carolina Legislature has been convened.  The
State is virtually out of union, and is equipping for war.  Fort
Pickens has been reinforced, without resistance on the part of the
Secessionists.  The Governor of Missouri, in his message to the
Legislature, condemns the action of President Lincoln's
administration.  The Texans had made 450 soldiers prisoners at
Indianola, to which place they had been moved for embarkation, in
consequence of General Twigg's treacherous agreement to evacuate
Texas.  The captives will be permitted to enlist in the Southern Army
or will be compelled to take an oath not to serve during the war
against the Southern Confederacy.</p>
               <p>President Lincoln has
issued another proclamation calling for 42,000 volunteers&#x2014;23,000 for
the regular army and 18,000 seamen.  The Secretary of the Washington
Treasury has resolved to contract a loan of 14,000,000 dols.</p>
               <p>The Government has decided to establish an arsenal at once at Rock
Island City, Illinois, in place of the Harper's Ferry Arsenal, just
destroyed.  Rock Island City stands on the banks of the Mississippi,
182 miles south-west of Chicago.</p>
               <p>The special correspondent of
the <title>Times</title> writes from Charleston, where he has been
inspecting the condition of Fort Sumter.  He attributes the success of
the attack to the skill of General Beauregard and the peculiar
position of Major Anderson, who was obliged to witness with impunity
the preparations of his adversaries.  The <title>New York
Tribune</title> publishes an extraordinary story as coming from a
deserter from Charleston to the effect that between 300 and 400 men
were killed in Fort Moultrie by the guns of Fort Sumter, and that they
were secretly buried and the matter kept quiet.</p>

               <p>Tuesday's <title>Gazette</title> contains the Royal proclamation
enjoining the observance, on the part of British subjects, of a strict
neutrality in regard to the hostilities which have broken out between
the United States of America and the Southern Confederacy.  The
proclamation quotes at length the various provisions of the Foreign
Enlistment Act, and then enumerates the several acts which would be
deemed an infraction of that statute.  In conclusion, British subjects
are warned that if they violate the law they will obtain no protection
from the penal consequences which may result from their
misconduct.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">This</hi> river,
besides possessing great natural beauties, has at the present time
attaching to it a political interest of no ordinary kind, on account
of its being the great waterway to Washington.  The United States'
steamers Anacosta and Pocahonta&#x2014;the latter a vessel of about 1800
tons&#x2014;are now at the Washington Navy Yard, and are, it is said, amply
sufficient to keep the navigation of the Potomac open against any
force that can possibly be brought against it for some time to come.
In this service the ships of war at Washington and in Chesapeake Bay
will be supported by Fort Washington, situated on the Maryland side of
the river on a rocky promontory, about forty miles below the capital.
This fort, of which we give an Engraving, is strongly garrisoned by
United States' troops.  Mount Vernon, once the home, but now the tomb,
of Washington, of which also we give an Illustration, lies fifteen
miles south of the city on the Potomac.</p>
               <p>A fine view of
Washington, Georgetown, and the surrounding land and water, is found
at an elevated point of the noted Cumberland-road, three or four miles
west of Washington.  From that spot the eye embraces a wide and
beautiful scene.  The broad, shining surface of the Potomac, as
emerging from between the high and rocky banks which confine its
channel above Georgetown, it begins to spread out in front <pb n="459"/>

               <p>of that city, where, divided by the gently-sloping
lawns of Mason's Island, it extends on one side along the Virginia
shore, and, widening on the other, appears to wash the foundations of
the President's house as it skirts along Washington, and, passing on
to Greenleaf's Point, receives the waters of its western branch.
These together form a spacious bay, the north-eastern extremity of
which is occupied by the United States' Navy Yard, while a caual [sic]
crosses the low cape which separates them.  Further down the Potomac
is seen sweeping its broad course, almost to the spot where it
receives a sad yet noble gloom from the overhanging precipices of
Mount Vernon.</p>
               <p>The northern branch of the Potomac rises within
the Appalachian Mountains, on the eastern declivity of the Backbone
Range, and runs in a valley in a north-eastern direction, thirty
miles, when it suddenly turns south-east, and breaks through two
chains of mountains in about ten miles of its course; it then runs
again north-east to Cumberland, and has a course of twenty miles in a
valley; deflecting again to the south-east, it traverses a mountain
range, and twenty miles below Cumberland it is joined by the South
Branch, which rises in the centre of Virginia, and runs north-east for
about 100 miles in a valley inclosed between the Alleghany [sic] and
Kittatinny chains, before it unites with the northern branch.  After
this junction the Potomac continues to flow in an eastern direction,
through mountain ranges, with great rapidity, until it turns
south-east, and before it breaks through the Blue Ridge, the most
eastern chain of the Appalachian system, is joined from the south by
the Shenandoah, the largest of its affluents, which rises in Virginia,
near 38 deg. N. lat., and flows over limestone rocks, in a wide and
fertile valley between the Kittatinny and Blue Ridge, for about 130
miles.  The united stream passes through the Blue Ridge at Harper's
Ferry by a gap, which has all the appearance of being the effect of a
violent disruption in the continuity of the mountain chain.  The river
now enters the plain country, through which it flows in a south-east
direction, with rather a rapid course.  The last falls occur a few
miles above Georgetown, to which place the tide ascends.  Below the
head of tide-water the Potomac becomes a deep and wide river, and,
passing Washington and Alexandria, it has a general east-south-east
course to the Chesapeake Bay, which it enters in 30 deg. N. lat.  At
the falls above Georgetown it is ten feet deep, and at Alexandria
three fathoms; so that vessels of any burden can ascend to the latter
place, and large vessels as far as Washington Navy Yard.  The whole
course of the river exceeds 320 miles.  Large boats ascend it fifty or
sixty miles above Harper's Ferry, and smaller ones much
higher.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> geographical and commercial
importance this great railway is equal, and in magnificent and
picturesque scenery superior, to any work of a similar kind on the
continent of America.  By its means the great and busy East and the
boundless Far West, shake hands; the dividing ridge of the Alleghany
[sic] Mountains has been  pierced through or cut asunder; the Atlantic
and the Mississippi are one, for between the waters of the Chesapeake
and the Ohio is one of the best lines of communication in the United
States.  This railway has also special claims to honour as being the
first line made in America by an incorporated company assisted by the
public purse.  The first stone was laid in 1828 by Charles Carroll, of
Carrollton, the same Charles Carroll who signed the Declaration of
Independence in 1776.  The first train drawn by steam power appeared
on the line on the opening of the first section of it, to Ellscott's
Mills, on the 30th of August, 1830, fifteen days before the opening of
the Manchester and Liverpool Railway in England, showing how rapidly
the Americans had adopted any improvements in locomotion made on this
side of the Atlantic.  It was not, however, until 1853 that the entire
line of 400 miles was completed: a formal opening then took place,
accompanied with great public rejoicings.  The Baltimore and Ohio
Railway is peculiarly interesting at the present time, as its course
is along that line which divides the border State of Maryland from
Virginia, or the old dominion, as it is often called.  Upon this line,
which follows in its general features the course of the Potomac River,
events are now taking place of the most momentous character.  We
purpose giving a series of illustrations of the railway and a
description of the locality through which it passes.  We commence with
three of its most important features.</p>
               <p>The Tray Run Viaduct is
one of the most remarkable engineering works on the whole line.  It
spans a deep gorge or run in the mountains 600 feet in width, and at a
height of 160 feet above the bed of the ravine.  The roadway is
supported on iron columns secured and braced in a peculiar manner, and
placed on a solid mass of masonry which fills up the bottom of the
run.  This work was designed by Mr. Albert Fink, one of the assistant
engineers on the line.  It is remarkably light in appearance, and is
rendered more strikingly so by being surrounded by masses of rock of
colossal dimensions towering above it at each end to an immense
height, and surrounding it, above and below, in every direction.  From
this cause it appears to be mere wirework, and, to the uninitiated,
dangerous in the extreme, although, when closely examined, its parts
will be found to be of ample dimensions.  The landscape scenery at
this spot is equal to anything in the world, combining the choicest
materials of mountain, forest, and river, a peculiar bend in the
course of the Cheat River which roars down the bottom of the great
valley, dyed deeply brown by the black spruce, hemlock, and laurels
that grow high up on the mountains, where it rises and affords an
opportunity of seeing the characteristics of the locality without
making them appear smaller. It is usual when the train arrives at the
west end of this viaduct to stop it for a short time, that the
passengers may alight and gaze for a few minutes at the remarkable
scenery surrounding them, a plan that would be highly advantageous in
other situations.</p>
               <p>Kingwood Tunnel is a fine and important
work, and the key of the whole line, piercing, as it does, the very
backbone of the Alleghany [sic] Mountains.  It is 4100 feet in length,
arched with brick, iron, and stone, and cost more than a million
dollars.  It was at first constructed without lining, but, being found
dangerous, it was determined by the managers not only to line it
efficiently, but also to widen it, so that two lines of rails might be
laid throughout it.  During the time this tunnel was in progress an
engineering feat in railway work was accomplished such as had never
before been thought of.  The tunnel being unfinished, and a rib of a
mountain, three quarters of a mile thick and three hundred feet high,
being in the way of the line, the difficulty was to join the lines at
either side.  The boldest experiment in engineering perhaps ever
adopted was tried here by Mr. La Trobe, and found to answer well.  He
determined, high and thick as the hill was, being unable to get
through or round it, to climb over the top, engines, carriages,
passengers, and all:  this he actually did, during the time the tunnel
was first being constructed, and afterwards repeated the practice for
a year while the tunnel was being arched and widened, and that, too,
without difficulty, delay, or inconvenience.  The manner in which it
was done is clearly shown in our Illustration of Boardtree Hill.  A
series of short inclines were made on the side of the hill
sufficiently long for an engine, tender, and two carriages to run
upon, and to allow of being shunted from one to the other, travelling
backwards and forwards alternately.  These inclines, being of the
maximum gradient the engines were capable of working over, of course
very soon brought the train to the top; the descent on the other side
was then accomplished in the same manner, the operation being
reversed.  The whole thing worked admirably.  Only one accident
occurred during the time it was in use, and that happened to one of
the company's servants through his own neglect.  The delay was not
great in working this curious railway-ladder, the whole train having
been passed over on one occasion in about twenty minutes.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">A
Monster</hi> meeting in support of the Government in the present crisis of
the nation was held in New York on Saturday, the 20th ult.  Such a
demonstration had never before been witnessed in the United States.  A
series of resolutions were proposed and unanimously adopted pledging
the meeting to use every means to preserve the Union intact and
inviolate, and agreeing to the appointment of a committee of
twenty-five to represent the city in the collection of funds and the
transaction of such other business in aid of the Government as the
public interests may require.  The following description of the
meeting is given by the <title>Times</title> correspondent at New York:&#x2014;"Early in
the morning a Massachusetts regiment arrived, and was hurried on
towards Philadelphia amid the cheers of the excited crowd. None seemed
disposed to attend to any business except his country's. The ensigns
that the day before waved from the flagstaffs of the principal
buildings seemed in the night to have blossomed out into thousands of
smaller starspangled banners, hanging from the windows and doors of
almost every house and shop in the town.  Nearly every man wore a
Union badge of the red, white, and blue of the flag upon his breast.
Most of the ladies as well wore cravats or badges of the same loyal
colours.  While the shops and the counting-rooms were deserted, the
corners of the streets and the neighbourhood of the newspaper-offices
were crowded with people anxious for the latest news from the South,
for there were rumours, which were confirmed later in the day, that
the railway-bridges between here and Baltimore were burnt, and
communication with the capital cut off.  At two o'clock the current
began to move up town.  The great Union meeting took place in
Union-square at three o'clock.  I have seen many large popular
gatherings in Europe&#x2014;the opening of the Great Exhibition, its closing
days; the funeral of the Duke of Wellington; the f&#x00EA;te of the Eagles in
Paris, for instance&#x2014;but I have never seen elsewhere so great, so
orderly, or so earnest a crowd as that of Saturday in Union-square.
The people of this great town were there in full force, realising the
emergency, and ready to maintain the Union that has made New York what
it is.  Their patriotism and enthusiasm forced on their leaders, and
drew from two at least who are known to have been Secessionists within
three weeks, strong Union speeches, in favour of immediate and
vigorous war.  There were several stands for speakers erected in
different parts of the square (which is half the size of
Eaton-square), and there was speaking from all of them, as well as
from several extemporised tribunes in the adjacent streets; and Major
Anderson was there-a more exciting speech than anything any orator
could say."</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN
AMERICA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The latest news from the States is of a very
warlike character, and dissipates the slight hopes that were
entertained of a pacific solution of the quarrel.  Both the Northern
and the Southern States are actively continuing their preparations for
civil war.  By the Bremen, which left New York on the 11th inst., we
have the following intelligence:&#x2014;The forward movement of National
troops on Baltimore has commenced.  Large bodies of troops from the
South are also advancing into Virginia.  Senator Wigfall has announced
that 100,000 Southerners are on their way to Washington, and that
President Lincoln and his Cabinet will be captured, unless they
retreat before the middle of June.  Active preparations are going on
in all the Northern States, and troops from every point are advancing
in the direction of Washington.  The Executive at Washington are
actively preparing for the emergency.  Western Virginia holds out
strong against secession.  Some soldiers of the National Army have
surrendered to the rebels at Texas, and Colonel Waite is also in their
hands as a prisoner of war.  The Northwestern States are very firm,
and loyal to the Federal Government.  The militia company of St.
Louis, having been supposed to be hostile to the Federal Government,
has been disarmed by Federal forces.  The mob fired on the Federal
troops, who returned the fire, killing twenty of the populace,
including two women and several children.  The Maryland Legislature
Committee have adopted resolutions condemning the Federal policy, but
recognising their obligations to the Union, and requesting the
President to cease the war until Congress assembles.  The cutter
Harriet Lane has captured a privateer.  The Governor of Kentucky has
issued a proclamation calling for a convention of the people to
declare for or against the Union.  The latest advices from Fort
Pickens state that six Federal war-vessels were off the fort.  The
Secessionists were preparing for an attack.  A convention has been
called in Western Virginia to form a separate State and join the
Union.  A ship has arrived in New York from Bermuda, on the 2nd inst.,
and reports passing the frigate St. George, with Prince Alfred on
board, entering Bermuda.  The Great Eastern arrived in New York at
11:30 a.m. to-day (11th inst.)</p>
               <p>The following scraps are from
other sources:&#x2014;The Union party in Baltimore had so far recovered
ascendancy that the passage through the city is said to be free and
the bridges between Baltimore and Washington had been completely
repaired.  The Virginians had seized the heights on the Maryland side
of the Potomac, and were engaged in intrenching themselves there.  A
bloody affray, which is obscurely related, had occurred in St. Louis
between the Secessionists and Federalists.  General Frost's brigade of
Missourian Militia, numbering some 800 men, had, we are told, been
"captured" near St. Louis by the Federal volunteers, who were assailed
with stones by the mob on their arrival in St. Louis, and who repelled
the attack by a fire of musketry which is said to have killed some
twenty persons.  Some 300,000 northern volunteers are asserted to have
proffered their services for the maintenance of the Union.  The
Legislature of Pennsylvania has passed bills for raising a loan of
4,000,000 dollars, and for levying fifteen more regiments of
volunteers.  The great Eastern has arrived at New York, and the
Washington Government was negotiating for her services as a
transport.</p>
               <p>In a secret Session on the 7th, Virginia was
admitted into the Southern Confederacy.  The Governor has issued a
proclamation declaring that he would resist any invasion of that
State.  Secession ordinances had been passed in Arkansas and
Tennessee; and there can be no doubt that North Carolina would comply
with the recommendations of her Government and do likewise.  The
Southern Congress has passed a law recognising the existence of war
with the Federal Government, and an Act has also been passed for
granting letter of marque&#x2014;thirty days to be allowed to United States'
vessels in Confederate ports to quit. It is very likely that public
attention will soon be fixed on Fort Pickens as it was on Fort Sumter,
for we read that General Bragg is making active preparations for an
attack.  The Southern Confederacy is said to be in possession of
military stores sufficient for the supply of an army of 150,000 men
for a year.</p>
               <p>President Davis has sent a new message of great
length to the Congress at Montgomery, in which he accuses President
Lincoln as having been wanting in courtesy, candour, and directness
towards the commissioners from the South.  Four-fifths of the contents
are devoted to the assertion of a State's right to dissolve connection
with the general Government when it finds itself hopelessly in the
minority.  The President of the Southern Confederation asserts that
the seceding States are earnestly desirous of peaceful, although
independent, relations with the Government at Washington; and he
endeavours to throw the onus of civil war upon the latter, neither
section being willing to assume the responsibility of the contest.  He
makes a grand parade of all his preparations, and concludes with the
following flourish:&#x2014;"We seek no conquest, no aggrandisement, no
concession from the free States.  All we ask is to be let alone, that
none shall attempt our subjugation by arms.  This we will and must
resist to the direst extremity.  The moment this pretension is
abandoned the sword will drop from our grasp, and we shall be ready to
enter into treaties of amity and commerce mutually beneficial.  So
long as this pretension is maintained, with a firm reliance on that
Divine power which covers with his protection the just cause, we will
continue to struggle for our inherent right to freedom, independence,
and self-government."</p>
               <p>The official correspondence between Mr.
Seward and Mr. Dayton, the new American Minister in Paris, on the
subject of the recognition by the French Government of the
independence of the Government of the Confederate States has been
published.  Mr. Seward requests Mr. Dayton to explain to the French
Government that there is not now, nor has there been, nor will there
be, any the least idea entertained by the Government of the United
States of suffering a dissolution of the Union to take place in any
way whatever, and that the thought of a dissolution of the Union
peaceably or by force has never entered into the mind of any candid
statesman here, and that it is high time that it be dismissed by
statesmen in Europe.</p>
               <p>Mr. Cassius M. Clay, U.S. Minister to
St. Petersburg, writes to the <title>Times</title>, setting forth what
he considers the salient point of the question at issue in the
impending conflict. He compares the relative strength of the
contending parties:&#x2014;"The whole seven revolted States (2,173,000) have
not as much white population as the single State of New York
(3,851,563) by 1,500,000 people.  If all the Slave States were to make
common cause, they have only 8,907,894 whites, with 4,000,000 slaves,
while the Union has about 20,000,000 of homogeneous people, as
powerful in peace and war as the world has seen. . . We can blockade
them by sea, and invade them by land, and close up the rebellion in a
single year if we are `let alone.'  For the population of the Slave
States is divided perhaps equally for and against the Union, the loyal
citizens being for the time overawed by the organised conspiracy of
the traitors; while the North is united to a man, the late allies of
the South, the Democratic party, being now more earnest for the
subjugation of the rebels than the Republicans.</p>

               </p>
               <p>. .
. President Davis has issued his first Message.  It has the
lengthiness in which American diplomatists delight, but its verbiage
by no means conceals the fact that the South means fighting.  On the
other hand, the tone of the North and of the authorities is equally
hostile, but more haughty. Recognition of the "belligerent" Southerner
is out of the question: he is nothing but a "rebel," whom the North
not only can but will put down by force of arms, and teach that the
Republic is one and indivisible.  A somewhat ill-judged letter has
been published here by Mr. Clay, who is accredited to the Court of
Russia by Mr. Lincoln. The writer is not content with making out the
case of the North as strongly as possible, but he urges England to
take part with the States, and asks whether she can afford to incur
the risk of the hatred of such a nation as America intends to be?  Our
answer is that we do not believe that we shall ever incur the hatred
of a truly great nation by persevering in a course of peaceful
neutrality, but that we are quite prepared, according to English
custom, to incur any risk in the path of duty.  It is thought that any
immediate hostilities on a large scale between North and South are
improbable, but that in the autumn the former will move down in full
strength upon the Confederacy.  But we fear that in the meantime we
shall hear much that will cause more pain in England than some of the
American journalists are willing to let their readers know.  The <title>New
York Herald</title> emphatically declares that England does not understand
America. Suppose we concede this, and answer that England does
something better&#x2014;she loves America, and expresses no feigned grief at
a crisis "which sends flying at each other's throats men who all utter
the war-cry before which Napoleon went down at Waterloo."</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Harper's Ferry</hi> is
a small town built upon a narrow declivitous tongue of land lying
directly at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers.  As
the mountain sides converge precipitously at all points there is but
little space for building on the level ground; the houses and public
buildings are therefore perched on ledges of rock, and in some cases
appear like cages hung up on the sides of the mountains.  The name of
this place has of late become familiar to most of our readers; first,
through the notoriety it obtained in consequence of one John Brown, an
Abolitionist enthusiast, having endeavoured to get up an insurrection
here; secondly, because the Virginian Secessionists attacked the
national armouries and arsenal located here.  These were abandoned by
the Unites States' officers in charge, but not until they had burnt
and destroyed nearly all the public property in their keeping.  No
doubt we shall soon hear again of Harper's Ferry, as it is extremely
probable that the recovery of that place will be one of the earliest
operations of the Union army in the coming campaign.  The force of the
rivers whose waters unite here has torn asunder the mountain range
that opposed their downward passage to the sea, and through a
tremendous cleft in the rock, as one river, their mingled waters roll
on to Washington.  For grand, picturesque beauty the scenery of this
place is unequalled; and many Europeans who have visited it say it is
well worth crossing the Atlantic to see.  Harper's Ferry is on the
line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway.  About eighty miles from the
city of Baltimore the railway crosses the river at this point by a
remarkable bridge of six arches, each of one hundred and thirty feet
span.  These arches are all of timber and iron, and roofed over, as is
usual with all such structures in America.  The United States'
armouries having occupied all the little level ground that existed at
the foot of the mountain, the railway company had to construct a road
for their line on the bed of the river for three quarters of a mile,
supported by a wall of masonry and iron piling.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">THE CITY OF
WASHINGTON.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">Washington</hi>, the capital of the United States
of North America, is situated on the Potomac, at the influx of the
Anacotia, in the federal district of Columbia.  It is laid out with
great regularity, on an extensive plan, and its public edifices are
amongst the most splendid in the Union.  Next to the far-famed
Capitol, and the as well-known White House, the principal objects of
interest in Washington are the four large structures for the chief
departments of the central Government, situated near the President's
official residence, the general post-office, treasury building, patent
offices, navy yard, arsenal, city hall, hospital, penitentiary,
theatre, Congress burying-ground, and upwards of twenty churches.</p>
               <p>We give on pages 486-487 a birdseye View of the city of Washington,
with the unfinished buildings of the Capitol in the foreground.  The
situation chosen for this great national edifice is in every respect a
most judicious one.  From its upper portions a fine view is obtained
not only of the city of Washington, but of the whole surrounding
country, the Potomac River, the groves of Mount Vernon, and the blue
hills of Virginia.  The building is constructed entirely of white
marble, and is an immense mass of columns, pilasters, pediments, of
the Corinthian order, all to be entirely crushed in effect by the huge
dome now erecting over the centre portion.  The central portico and
the left wings are portions of the old Capitol, above which was
originally built a dome of dimensions in proportion with the fa&#x00E7;ade
below.  As great additions are now being made at each end of the
original block, its length being doubled, the architects have thought
that the same liberty might be taken in adding to the height of the
upper part of the central portion&#x2014;hence the injudicious attempt to get
effect by the construction of this monstrous dome, out of all
proportion with that which supports it.  The site for this building
was chosen by Washington himself.  On the 18th of September, 1793, he
laid the corner-stone, and seven years afterwards the seat of
Government was removed to it from Philadelphia; in 1814 the first
building was burned by the British, together with the library of
Congress, the President's house, and other public works.  In 1818 it
was entirely repaired, and on the 4th of July, 1851, President
Fillmore laid the corner-stone of the new buildings, which makes the
edifice now more than twice its original size.  Its whole length is
751 feet, and the area covered by buildings is about four acres.  In
the wings are situated the Senate Chamber and the Hall of
Representatives of the Congress.  In the centre, under the dome, is
the grand Rotunda.  Here, besides many statues and busts, are eight
pictures of American history, painted by native artists.  Those by
Trumbull are the best, the subjects being events that took place
during the War of Independence, in which the artist served.  These
pictures must be highly valued by the Americans, as they contain
excellent portraits of nearly all the eminent men who played a part in
the most important period of her history.  In the interior of the
various halls, chambers, and corridors, throughout the edifice the
most elaborate style of decoration has been adopted: some of the
apartments are lined entirely with beautiful and costly marbles; the
ceilings are invariably wrought in the richest colours and devices;
while gold and bronze are used with unsparing hand wherever an
opportunity offers.  The unfinished state of the building at present
prevents any just opinion being formed of what the effect as a whole
will be, but, from the liberal manner in which all the most expensive
means of producing richness of effect in architectural decoration have
been employed, it is but reasonable to suppose that the Capitol of
Washington, when completed, will favourably compare with any other
similar building in Europe, even with our own Houses of
Parliament.</p>

               <p rend="center">THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.<lb/><hi rend="small">THE BORDER SLAVE
STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">If</hi> we contemplate a map of the United States we
cannot fail to perceive that one of the most marked physical features
of the country is a range of mountains running in a south-westerly
direction from Maine to the northern parts of Alabama and Georgia.
The chain, called indifferently the Appalachian or Alleghanies [sic],
consists of a number of detached groups, each with a local designation
of its own, though all included under the above general title.  It is
over 1200 miles in length.  The ridges run all in the same direction,
either in the same line or parallel to each other, and have a mean
breadth of about 100 miles, and a mean elevation of from 2500 to 3000
feet above the sea level. The abrupt ridges face the Atlantic; on the
west the descent is almost lost in the broad, elevated plateau which
slopes down towards the Mississippi.  In Virginia and Tennessee the
valley at the foot of the western face of the mountains is 1700 feet
above the sea level, and the plateau which continues it for 100 miles
to the west through Eastern and Mid Kentucky and Eastern and Mid
Tennessee is 100 miles broad, of an elevation of from 1500 to 2000
feet, and traversed by longitudinal ridges of high hills.</p>
               <p>North of Mason and Dixon's line&#x2014;the line of separation between the
Free-labour and Slave States of the Union&#x2014;this system of mountains
has no political significance whatever; but, as we approach latitudes
which are decidedly southern in the estimation of men of European
descent, these uplands of the Alleghanies [sic] have a very direct and
beautifully-distinct bearing upon the vegetable and animal productions
of the region, upon the distribution of the white and black races of
men, and, therefore, on the political character of the communities
which are located there. In the lowlands of Eastern Maryland, Eastern
Virginia and North Carolina, and of Western Kentucky and Tennessee, we
observe, accordingly, a powerful plantation and slave-breeding
interest. Tobacco, slaves, and a little cotton are the chief
productions; in a word, slave labour reigns.  But on ascending to the
intervening highlands we find a different climate, different
productions, different pursuits, and a different ratio of the two
races.  The highland region and elevated plateaus are favourable to
the growth of grain and the raising of live stock, while the mountains
contain inexhaustible supplies of coal and iron.</p>
               <p>The
agriculturists and miners of this region are white men; and, although
slavery is recognised there as a lawful and proper institution, yet,
in point of fact, the slaves form a very inconsiderable element of the
population. Thus in this part of the world's surface, as in so many
others, the physical line of demarcation drawn by Nature herself
between the highlanders and the lowlanders is accompanied by an
industrial, moral, and political dissimilarity.  In the course of this
revolution this political dissimilarity has already made itself felt.
The Union sympathies of the highlanders prevented North Carolina and
Tennessee from seceding in the first instance; and it still remains to
be seen whether the Secessionists, who have it all their own way on
the plantations, will not meet with resistance from the farms.  But it
is in the border Slave States where the action of the physical
features of the Alleghanies [sic] on the political sympathies of the
inhabitants is most distinctly traceable.</p>
               <p>Of the four border
Slave States&#x2014;viz., Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri&#x2014;all
except Virginia have resolved on remaining in the Union; and in
Virginia herself we hear that the people of the western counties are
preparing to secede from the State, rather than secede with the State
from the national Union.  Not that the people of the three adhering
Slave States are well affected towards Mr. Lincoln's administration;
far from it.  A great majority of them are violently opposed to the
war Mr. Lincoln is levying on the seceded States.  They desire to see
the independence of the seceded States acknowledged by the Government
and people of the United States.  Nevertheless, so long as the war
does not become a war of emancipation to the slaves, they consent to
forgo all active resistance to the Government of Washington.</p>
               <p>It is a proof of the divided state of public opinion in these
States that, although their Governors have refused to furnish their
quota of troops asked for by the Federal Government, individual
Kentuckians and Missourians have offered to raise the required number
in their respective States. We present a schedule of the population of
these States, whereby the true proportions of the slaveowning interest
therein will reveal itself:&#x2014;</p>

               <p>This exhibits a very different
social condition from that of South Carolina and Mississippi, where
the slaves outnumber the freemen.  It cannot surprise us, therefore,
to find that these States have given birth to a very different class
of politicians from those which have obtained eminence in the Cotton
States.  Of the moderate and conservative attitude of Maryland in the
sectional struggle of the last twenty years we wrote last week.  It
remains to add that one of the members of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, Mr.
Blair, Postmaster-General, is a Marylander; and that Henry Winter
Davis, another prominent politician of this State, holds doctrines
much more akin to those of Mr. Seward than to those professed by Mr.
Jefferson Davis.  Kentucky, too, was the mother of Henry Clay, the
statesman who aspired to hold the balance even between Massachusetts
and South Carolina; of John Jay Crittenden, who wears the mantle of
Henry Clay, of Prentiss, the witty editor of the almost free-soil
<title>Louisville Journal</title>; and of Cassius Clay, the heroic
champion of free-labour principles on Kentucky soil, who has lately
been appointed by Mr. Lincoln to represent the United States at the
Russian Court, and who is now in London on his way to St. Petersburg.
Missouri, lying as it does so high above the sea level, and having a
climate similar to that of Illinois and Kansas, has long won the
distinction of being the only Slave State where the Emancipationists
exist as a distinct political party.  Mr. Edward Bates, of this State
and party, is the present Attorney-General of the United States, and,
consequently, a member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet. At the election of
last summer Mr. Frank Blair, an Emancipationist, was sent to Congress
from the district of which the city of St. Louis is the centre, and
that city is now governed by an Emancipationist Mayor and an
Emancipationist Town Council.  This state of things has been brought
about chiefly by the large immigration of Germans.  The native
American of the Free States is so prone to "bow to the majority" that,
on migrating to Southern soil, he easily acquiesces in the prevailing
opinions of his adopted State.  The unadulterated German is of a
different cast of mind.  He believes logic and abstract ideas stronger
and more worthy of obedience than popular majorities. Hence it has
fallen to the lot of the German immigrants to furnish the "backbone"
of the Free-labour party in Missouri, and to rally around themselves
such native Americans and other adopted citizens as entertain similar
principles.</p>
               <p>Virginia has chosen to separate herself from the
other border States.  Although her people have not yet ratified by a
popular vote the secession ordinance of her Convention, the current of
popular feeling renders it clear that her proclivities are towards
Montgomery, not Washington.  She is the great Slave-breeding State,
mother not only of United States' Presidents, but of Cotton State
slaves.  Her population is more heavily charged with the slave element
than are Kentucky and Maryland.</p>

               <p>The course of revolution is not destined to run
smoothly in this ancient Commonwealth, named by Raleigh in honour of
Queen Bess. Northern armies threaten to "crush it out" in the East;
the Alleghanies [sic] interpose a barrier to its progress in the West.
Turn again to the map and you will observe a "spur" of Virginia
running up between the States of Ohio and Pennsylvania.  The chief
city of this district is Wheeling, a thriving little manufacturing
town of 15,000 inhabitants, on the east bank of the Ohio River.  The
whole region is called "the Panhandle," from some fancied similarity
in the configuration of Virginia to a pan and its handle.  On learning
that the Eastern Virginians were bent on precipitating the State into
revolution the people of North-Western Virginia, who are entirely
homogeneous with their neighbours of Ohio and Pennsylvania, and among
whom slavery has but a nominal existence, determined to do a little
stroke of secession on their own account.  They refuse to pay any more
taxes to the State Government: they have made an appeal to Mr. Lincoln
for arms to defend themselves against the Secessionists (an appeal
which certainly will not be made in vain), and they have called a
Convention of Western Virginians, which was to have assembled at
Wheeling on the 13th inst., to take all necessary measures to ensure
the permanence of their relations with the Federal Government.</p>
               <p>The Secessionists hope to confine this counter-revolutionary
movement to the Panhandle, or, at the worst, to the trans-Alleghany
[sic] tract of Virginia; the Unionists, on the other hand, give out
that all Virginia west of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the easternmost
ridge of the Alleghany [sic] chain, will follow the Convention of
Wheeling rather than the Convention of Richmond.  What will be the
exact extent of this Vendean defection of the North-West must be
determined by the ballot-box or the fortunes of war.  These modern
Vendeans, rallying under the beloved flag of the Union, and working in
the interest of free labour, will not ask for Northern help in vain.
The North may or may not be able to hold Eastern Virginia by force of
arms; Western Virginia, at least, is bound to her by stronger and more
abiding ties-those arising from identity of interests, occupations,
and ideas.</p>
               <p>We easily familiarise ourselves with the idea of a
State or a group of States seceding from a Federal Union.  All Federal
Governments are subject to such catastrophes; and in America the
conflict between the State and the Union has never entirely ceased;
but the insurrection of a county or a group of counties against a
State is carrying the principle of revolution a step further than it
has ever been carried before, even in America, and is a decided
novelty of the season.  Yet, although the two movements of the State
and the counties proceed on two antagonistic principles-the one being
effected in behalf of slavery and State rights, the other in the name
of free labour and Federal rights-they have one characteristic in
common which underlies the whole political crisis.  This
characteristic is the desire for homogeneousness.  The Slave States in
general, and the Eastern Virginians in particular, secede in order to
enjoy the advantages, real or supposed, of a more congenial national
fellowship than that afforded them by the late Union; and the Western
Virginians secede from the State because they have that consciousness
of homogeneousness with the people of the residuary United States
which they have no hope of finding among the people who have chosen
Mr. Jefferson Davis for their leader.</p>
               <p>It results, then, from
this examination that the United States have a stronger hold on three
of the border Slave States, and a portion of the fourth, than that
transitory and precarious authority which depends on an army of
occupation.  That moral bond, active in the border States, is lacking
under existing institutions in the cotton States, and the Northern
people are preparing to supply its place by a blockade and an
invasion.  Whether they can achieve a permanent triumph in this war
without subverting the "domestic institution" at the South, which Mr.
Lincoln declares to be farthest from his design and desires; and
whether, as necessary to this triumph, they can keep on foot large
military and naval forces, maintain a long civil war, and hold in
subjection large and hostile communities, without subverting the
system of co-equal Federal Republics, founded by Washington and his
contemporaries, and converting the Federal Union into a more
centralised and consolidated Republic of the French type, or even (<hi rend="italic">absit omen!</hi>) into a military dictatorship, are
questions which the events now taking place in the western world are
forcing on the attention of mankind.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi>
secession of Virginia from the Union was not a mere formality, but was
soon followed by overt acts of hostility on the part of the
Virginians.  Besides taking Harper's Ferry, and thus closing the
Western Railroad, they compelled the United States' Navy officers at
Norfolk to burn eleven men-of-war, including the famous Merrimac, and
to blow up the munitions, stores, and docks at that yard, to prevent
their falling into the hands of the Secessionists.  But the naval
force of the Federal Government is still tolerably strong in those
waters, and is able, it would appear, to blockade the mouth of the
James River, by holding Hampton roads, and to keep open the Potomac.
In this service the ships of war will be supported by Fort Monroe, at
Old Point Comfort.  Fort Monroe, which is still garrisoned by United
States' troops, situated on the north point of the mouth of James
River, and is about one mile from Fort Calhoun, on the Ripraps.  This
fort is a large and strong military post.  The walls are more than a
mile in circuit, very thick and high, surrounded by a moat, which is
from sixty to one hundred feet wide, with eight feet of water,
drawbridge, and outer batteries.  It mounts some three hundred heavy
guns, has mortars for throwing shells, and is provided with furnaces
for making the shot red hot.  The range is about three miles.  The
walls inclose about seventy-five acres.  The parade-ground is in the
centre, and all round it are the barracks.  Being well planted with
trees, it is a pleasant shady place in summer.  Outside the moat is a
fine walk, with a view of the sea.  In this fort is the famous
fifteen-inch gun designed by Major Rodman, U.S.A., which is supposed
to be the largest piece of ordnance <pb n="500"/> ever cast whole.  An
officer from Fort Monroe says that there are now 1300 men in the fort,
that the guns are in good order, and everything is as desirable as it
should be for order successfully to withstand a six months'
siege.</p>

establishments in many of the towns of America, and in New York

picked men of the city, are, in fact, well-organised clubs, and their
stations are fitted up with reference to the tastes and habits of such
associations, and contrast very strikingly with the plain stablelike
buildings in which our gallant bodies of firemen with their engines
are housed.  We gave some little time since in our Journal a Sketch of
the interior of one of the fire-brigade stations of New York, showing
the kind of place in which the amateur, or rather volunteer, firemen
take their ease while on their turn of duty; and our present Sketch
shows the exterior of one of the buildings.  It is, as may be seen, of
some architectural pretension; but its immediate attraction is the
numerous placards which have reference to the civil war now unhappily
impending.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">On</hi>
presenting our subscribers with a Map of the United States we think it
not inopportune to give a slight sketch of the wonderful development
of the United States in population and power during the interval which
elapsed between 1780 and 1860.  In that period the thirteen
settlements of the Atlantic seaboard, sparsely peopled by three
millions of human beings, have expanded into thirty-four sovereign
States and eight organised Territories, covering the whole surface of
the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the southern
boundary of British America to the northern boundary of Mexico.  The
present year has seen that immense Confederation rent asunder by the
people of the Slaveholding States, and at this moment the Federal
Government, representing the ideas and interests of the Northern
States, are waging a war to "reconstruct" the preexisting Union.
Whether the Washington Government will succeed in reuniting the two
sections of the great Republic under one Government depends on the
fortunes of the civil war now being prosecuted by it against the
"insurrectionists."  But, whether the seceding States eventually gain
a recognition of their independence or not, the colossal development
of the Confederation of the United States in the fourscore years which
have elapsed since 1780 must long arrest the attention and challenge
the admiration of mankind.</p>
               <p>The original thirteen colonies
which threw off their allegiance to Great Britain, and formed the
primary articles of Confederation, and afterwards the existing
constitution of the United States, were New Hampshire, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Georgia.  To these were added, in 1791, Vermont, separated from New
York; in 1792, Kentucky, from Virginia; in 1796, Tennessee, from North
Carolina; in 1802, Ohio, from the North-West Territory; in 1812,
Louisiana, from the Territory of that name, purchased from France; in
1816, Indiana, from the North-West Territory; in 1817, Mississippi,
from the Georgia Cession; in 1818, Illinois, from the North-West
Territory; in 1819 Alabama, from the Georgia Cession; in 1820, Maine,
separated from Massachusetts; in 1821, Missouri, set off from the
Louisiana purchase, and concerning whose admission as a Slave State
the first great sectional struggle between the Slaveholding and
Non-Slaveholding States took place; in 1836, Arkansas; in 1837,
Michigan; in 1845, Florida (from territory purchased from Spain); in
the same year Texas, formerly a province of Mexico, and concerning
whose admission into the Union as a Slave State the second conflict
between the Pro-Slavery and Anti-Slavery parties took place; in 1846,
Iowa; in 1848, Wisconsin; in 1850, California (conquered from Mexico),
and whose admission into the Union as a Free-Labour State was strongly
opposed by the extreme South; in 1858, Minnesota; in 1859, Oregon.
Oregon constituted the thirty-third State of the Union, and was,
strictly speaking, the last State admitted into the Union before the
commencement of the present revolution.  Since the secession of
several States, and the withdrawal of their senators and
representatives from Congress, the Act admitting Kansas as the
twentieth Free-Labour State of the Union has become law. It was for
ascendancy in this late territory of Kansas that the same two sections
of the country fought so bitterly for five years (1854-9).  The
victory remained with the <pb n="504"/> Free-soilers.  Kansas adopted
an Anti-Slavery Constitution, but the Pro-Slavery party were able to
postpone her admission into the Union until after the withdrawal of a
large portion of their representatives from Congress.</p>
               <p>A few
words as to the Territories. Utah is the home of the Mormon community.
 New Mexico is an elevated, and for the most part sterile, region
ceded to the United States by Mexico at the close of the Mexican War.
Indian Territory is the reserve, where the Choctaws, Cherokees,
Creeks, Chickasaws, and other domesticated tribes of Indians are
settled.  Of Nebraska, Washington, and Dakotah Territories there is
nothing special to remark.   Colorado and Nevada were organised only
so recently as a few months ago.  The latter is rendered famous by
being the seat of the Washoe silver-mines, and contains the beautiful
Carson Valley, which lies at the foot of the Sierra Nevada.  The
district of Columbia, surrounded by Virginia and Maryland, contains
the city of Washington, and is governed directly by Congress.</p>
               <p>Population has multiplied even faster than States and Territories.
The population of the United States in 1780 was commonly estimated at
3,000,000, of whom half a million were slaves.  The first Census of
the United States was taken in 1790, and it has since been renewed at
each successive decennial period. We present the main results of the
population returns of the successive Censuses in schedules:&#x2014;</p>

               <p>The predominant interest of the Unites States,
both North and South, is agriculture and the raising of live stock.
In the North the grains and fruits of the north temperate latitudes
prevail.  In the South cotton, tobacco, rice, and sugar, are the great
staples: but little wheat is grown south of Tennessee and Missouri.
The mineral wealth of the United States is enormous, but little
developed in comparison with its resources.  The chief mining States
are Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, Missouri, and
California.  The principal manufacturing States are Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.
New York city and State rank highest in commercial importance.  The
seaboard States of the New England group are largely engaged in
ship-building and deep-sea fisheries.  The tobacco and slave-breeding
States are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina.  The
cotton, rice, and sugar region includes South Carolina, the States
bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, and south-western Tennessee.  The
agricultural resources of California are more valuable than her mines,
and are hardly to be surpassed in any quarter of the globe.</p>

discovered are the Pino Alto mines, in the Arezona [sic] territory.
They are located on the summit of the Sierra Madae [sic], and are

                  <hi rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Up to the 18th
ult., when the City of Baltimore left New York, there had been no
collision between the forces assembled in the neighbourhood of
Washington.  Both sides were active in their preparations.  As 31,000
troops are said to be now assembled in Washington, that city may be
deemed secure from any attack by the Southerners.</p>
               <p>The
Legislature of Massachusetts had appropriated 3,000,000 dollars for
war purposes, and had authorised the Governor to lend 7,000,000.</p>
               <p>The Governor of Maryland had called for four regiments to support
the Federal Government within the limits of Maryland, or to protect
the capital.  Baltimore was occupied by Pennsylvanian troops, and
General Scott, it was said, had ordered the occupation of the
Arlington heights by Federal artillery.  The most important step,
however, on the part of the Federal Government was the effective
blockade of Charleston by the frigate Niagara.</p>
               <p>The
Southerners on their side were sending ammunition and heavy ordnance
to Harper's Ferry, and had threatened Fort Munroe [sic], but were
compelled to retire.  It was said that President Davis would command
the Southern forces in person.</p>
               <p>Virginia has been admitted
into the Southern Confederacy, but it is averred that the Unionist
feeling is spreading in the State.  A convention of representatives of
its western division, in which forty counties are represented, is now
sitting to consider a proposition for its formation into a separate
State, and the Governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania have pledged
themselves to support the Unionists in that district.  As there are
scarcely any slaves in Western Virginia, the new State, if it should
be formed, will, in all probability, be a Free State, and will of
course join the Federal Union.  Meanwhile the blockade of the Virginia
waters is complete.</p>
               <p>It is stated that the remains of
Washington have been removed from Mount Vernon by the Virginians.</p>
               <p>The Federal Government has, it is said, notified to the
representatives of foreign Powers that it will cease to hold
intercourse with any nation which recognises commissioners from the
seceding States; and it is reported that the Governors of all the Free
Western States have asked for and obtained from President Lincoln a
pledge that no compromise or cessation of war shall take place until
the national flag floats over all the national property.</p>
               <p>The
Legislature of Kentucky had approved the Governor's refusal to supply
troops to the Federal Government, but determined to maintain
neutrality.</p>
               <p>From further accounts of the events at St. Louis
it appears that the Federal volunteers, some 6000 strong, who were
assembled in that city, surrounded, disarmed, and made prisoners some
800 of the Missouri militia, who were encamped in the immediate
neighbourhood, on the ground that they cherished purposes hostile to
the Union.  After the disarming had been effected, pistol shots were
fired by some of the crowd of spectators, and a volunteer officer was
wounded.  He instantly bade his men fire, and the consequence was a
volley which seems to have killed or wounded some twenty persons,
including women and children.  Fierce excitement therefore prevailed
among the mob of St. Louis; but further bloodshed seems to have been
averted by the vigour of the authorities.</p>
               <p>The situation of
affairs is thus epitomised in the <title>New York Herald</title> of
the 18th ult.:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>No important movement of troops took place at
Washington yesterday.</p>
               <p>It is rumoured that the French
Government has a diplomatic agent now travelling through the South on
a tour of observation.</p>
               <p>General Scott is busy arresting spies in
the Federal capital, many of whom register their names at the hotels
as coming from the North.  It is probable that these gentlemen will be
summarily dealt with.</p>
               <p>General Mansfield has issued an order
prohibiting Adam's Express Company from carrying any express matter,
including letters, further south than Washington.</p>
               <p>The
Government, in pursuance of its programme, has appointed collectors of
customs at the different Southern ports, selecting men who can be
relied upon for that office.  The duties will be collected on the
decks of ships of war at all hazard.</p>
               <p>The blockade of Southern
ports by the United States squadron appears to be carried out with
vigour and promptitude.  At Charleston the entrance of three British
vessels have been prevented by the frigate Niagara, and another, after
being boarded, was allowed to pass up.  One ship, however, carrying
the British flag succeeded in running the blockade, although she was
pursued.  She eventually got into shoal water, and was towed up to the
city.  An important seizure of an outwardbound American ship was made
by the gunboat Quaker City at the mouth of the Chesapeake on Tuesday,
with a cargo of tobacco for Europe.  She was loaded at Richmond, and
is valued at 150,000 dols.  The vessel proved to be the Arago,
belonging to Bath, Maine; and though carrying the United States' flag
she was seized, no doubt on the double charge of running the blockade
and of treason&#x2014;in assisting the rebel States, she being a Northern
ship.  Commodore Stringham put a prize crew on board, and sent her on
her way to New York, where she will probably be confiscated.  This is
the first prize taken by the United States' blockading squadron.</p>
               <p>The ports of Florida have been put under blockade since the 6th
inst., and the yacht Wanderer, of slave trade notoriety, has been
seized off Key West by the Crusader.  The steamer City of Richmond,
which arrived at Philadelphia last night from Washington, reports
having passed the United States' steamer Yankee, thirty miles south of
Cape Henlopen, with three prize steamers in charge.</p>
               <p>We learn
the important intelligence from Havannah that the steam-tug W.H. Webb,
which was seized some time since by the rebel authorities while
attempting to supply Fort Pickens, and has since been used, no doubt,
for privateering purposes, was refused a clearance by the United
States' Consul-General of Cuba.  She was, however, immediately
purchased by some British residents there, and sailed under the
English flag.</p>
               <p>It is stated that the rebel troops at Harper's
Ferry have been actively engaged in throwing up new batteries on the
hills for the past few days.  They are in expectation of an immediate
attack in that quarter.</p>
               <p>The Union men in Missouri are acting
with great determination.  In addition to the capture of the Secession
forces at Camp Jackson, a detachment of volunteers, under Captain
Cole, surrounded the town of Potosi, where a band of Secessionists
were in possession.  They were all taken, and the ring leaders sent to
St. Louis as prisoners of war.  A company of rebel cavalry were also
dispersed at De Soto by the same body of Union volunteers and thirty
horses captured.  If this vigorous course is continued Missouri is
very likely to be saved.  It is said that the Government have
determined to treat Missouri as they have done Maryland, and to this
end are about to take charge of the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad
for the use of Government.</p>
               <p>It is now pretty generally
believed that there is some truth in the report of the desecration of
Washington's tomb.  The <title>Lynchburg Virginian</title> states that
the remains have been transferred to Lexington, Virginia, and
deposited in a suitable mausoleum there.  It is known that a strong
guard of Secessionists had been quartered for some days at Mount
Vernon, and it is not unlikely that their object was the removal of
the body of Washington.  [Another account states that the remains were
removed by order of Colonel Washington; whilst, according to another
report, the rumour of the removal of Washington's remains is said to
be totally false.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE BLOCKADE OF AMERICAN
PORTS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A collection of official correspondence with the
United States' Government respecting the blockade has just been
presented to Parliament by command.  The practical information it
contains is embodied in the following extract from a despatch from
Lord Lyons to Admiral Milne, dated Washington, May 11:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>The
general result of inquiries made by me or other foreign Ministers here
as to the manner in which the blockade will be conducted appears to
be&#x2014;</p>
               <p>1. That the date of the commencement of the blockade in
each locality will be fixed by the issue of a notice by the commanding
officer of the squadron appointed to blockade it.  It does not,
however, appear to be intended that such notice shall be officially
communicated to the Governments of neutral nations, or to their
representatives in this country.</p>
               <p>2. That fifteen days from
the beginning of the effective blockade will be allowed in every case
for neutral vessels already in port to put to sea.</p>
               <p>3. That
until the fifteen days have expired neutral vessels will be allowed to
come out with  or without cargoes, and whether their cargoes were
shipped before or after the commencement of the blockade.</p>
               <p>4. That except in the last-mentioned particular the
	       ordinary rules of blockade will be strictly enforced.</p>
               <p>6. The armed
vessels of the neutral States will have the right to enter and depart
from the blockaded ports.</p>
               <p>I continue to be of opinion that,
provided the blockade be effective, and be carried on in conformity
with the law of nations, we have no other  course, in the absence of
positive instructions from her Majesty's Government, than to recognise
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE HON. EDWARD EVERETT ON THE AMERICAN
CRISIS.  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Edward Everett has lately delivered an
address on the Union, of which the following is the concluding
portion:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>I was willing, while this ill-starred movement was
confined to the States of the extreme South, and they abstained from
further aggression, that they should go in peace.  This course, I
thought, would retain the border States and bring back the seceders in
a year or two, wearied and disgusted with their burdensome and
perilous experiment.  Such I understood to have been, in substance,
the programme of the Administration.  But the South has willed it
otherwise.  She has struck a parricidal blow at the heart of the
Union; and to sustain her in this unnatural and unrighteous war is
what my conscience forbids.  Neither will I remain silent and see this
majestic framework <pb n="505"/> of government, the noblest political
fabric ever reared by human wisdom prostrated in the dust to gratify
the disappointed ambition of a few aspiring men (for that Mr.
Vice-President Stephens bravely told his fellow-citizens last November
was the cause of "a great part of our troubles"), and this under cover
of a sophistical interpretation of the Constitution, at war alike with
common sense, with contemporary history, and the traditions of the
Government, unsupported by a single authority among the framers of the
Constitution, and emphatically denounced by Mr. Madison, their leader
and chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">GLIMPSES OF THE CONFEDERATE
STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <title>Times</title> publishes letters from
its Special Correspondent who has been in South Carolina, Georgia, and
Alabama.</p>
               <p>Writing from South Carolina on the 30th of April, he
says that there is a general feeling among the planters in favour of
an English Sovereign:&#x2014;From all quarters has come to my ears the
echoes of the same voice; it may be feigned, but there is no discord
in the note, and it sounds in wonderful strength and monotony all over
the country.  Shades of George III., of North, of Johnson, of all who
contended against the great rebellion which tore these colonies from
England!  can you hear the chorus which rings through the States of
Marion, Sumter, and Pickney [sic], and not clap your ghostly hands in
triumph?  That voice says, "If we could only get one of the Royal race
of England to rule over us, we should be content."  Let there be no
misconception on this point.  That sentiment, varied in a hundred
ways, has been repeated to me over and over again.  There is a general
admission that the means to such an end are wanting, and that the
desire cannot be gratified.  But the admiration for monarchical
institutions on the English model, for privileged classes, and for a
landed aristocracy and gentry, is undisguised and apparently genuine.
With the pride of having achieved their independence is mingled in the
South Carolinians['] hearts a strange regret at the result and
consequences, and many are they who "would go back to-morrow if we
could."  An intense affection for the British connection, a love of
British habits and customs, a respect for British sentiment, law,
authority, order, civilisation, and literature, pre-eminently
distinguish the inhabitants of this State, who, glorying in their
descent from ancient families on the three islands, whose fortunes
they still follow, and with whose members they maintain not
infrequently familiar relations, regard with an aversion for which it
is impossible to give an idea to one who has not seen its
manifestations the people of New England and the population of the
Northern States, whom they look on as  tainted beyond cure by the
venom of "Puritanism."  Whatever may be the cause, this is the fact
and the effect.  The North is to South Carolina a corrupt and evil
thing, to which for long years she has been bound by burning chains,
while monopolists and manufacturers fed on her tender limbs.  South
Carolina contains 34,000 square miles and a population of 720,000
inhabitants, of whom 385,000 are black slaves.  They entertain very
exaggerated ideas of the military strength of their little community,
although one may do full justice to its military spirit.  Out of their
whole population they cannot reckon more than 60,000 adult men by any
arithmetic, and as there are nearly 30,000 plantations which must be,
according to law, superintended by white men, a considerable number of
these adults cannot be spared from the State for service in the open
field.  The planters boast that they can raise their crops without any
inconvenience by the labour of their negroes, and they seem confident
that the negroes will work without superintendence.  But the
experiment is rather dangerous, and it will only be tried in the last
extremity.</p>
               <p>Writing from Savannah, Georgia, on the 1st ult.,
Mr. Russell describes a visit to Fort Pulaski, which defends the mouth
of the Savannah River and the approaches to the city, and is described
as being very strong.  The garrison of the fort is 650 men, and fully
that number were in and about the work, their tents being pitched
inside the Redan or on the terreplein of the parapets.  "The channel
is very narrow and passes close to the guns of the fort.  The means of
completing the armament have been furnished by the stores of Norfolk
Navy-yard, where between 700 and 800 guns have fallen into the hands
of the Confederates; and, if there are no Columbiades among them, the
Merrimac and other ships, which have been raised, as we hear, with
guns uninjured, will yield up their Dahlgrens to turn their muzzles
against their old masters."  Among the party were Commodore Tatnall,
whose name will be familiar to English ears in connection with the
attack on the Peiho Forts, where the gallant American showed the world
that "blood was thicker than water;" Brigadier-General Lawton, in
command of the forces of Georgia, and a number of naval and military
officers, of whom many had belonged to the United States' regular
services.  Writing on the 2nd, he says there is a sudden change of
feeling in favour of peace.  Men looked grave and talked about the
interference of England and France, which "cannot allow this thing to
go on."  But the change which had come over them was unmistakable, and
the best men begun to look grave.  "As for me (he adds) I must prepare
to open my lines of retreat&#x2014;my communications are in danger."</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell gives the following as part of the programme of the
Southern States of America:&#x2014;"It is intended to buy up all the cotton
crop which can be brought into the market at an average price, and to
give bonds to the Confederate States for the amount, these bonds
being, as we know, secured by the export duty on cotton.  The
Government, with this cotton crop in its own hands, will use it as a
formidable machine of war, for cotton can do anything, from the
establishment of an empire to the securing of a shirt-button.  It is
at once king and subject, master and servant, captain and soldier,
artilleryman and gun.  Not one bale of cotton will be permitted to
enter the Northern States.  It will be made an offense punishable with
tremendous penalties, among which confiscation of property, enormous
fines, and even the penalty of death are enumerated, to send cotton
into the Free States.  Thus Lowell and its kindred factories will be
reduced to ruin, it is said, and the North to the direst distress.  If
Manchester can get cotton and Lowell cannot, there are good times
coming for the millowners."</p>
               <p>Speaking of the issue of letters
of marque, the correspondent says:&#x2014;"But it may be asked, who will
take these letters of marque?  Where is the Government of Montgomery
to find ships?  The answer is to be found in the fact that already
numerous applications have been received from the shipowners of New
England, from the whalers of New Bedford, and from others in the
Northern States for these very letters of marque, accompanied by the
highest securities and guarantees!  This statement I make on the very
highest authority.  I leave it to you to deal with the facts."</p>
               <p>The last letter of the special correspondent of our contemporary is
from Montgomery, capital of the Confederate States of America.  It is
interesting in many ways, describing the state of war preparation and
excitement throughout the South.  He indicates that there is a change
in the tone of the Southrons.  Impressed at length by the conviction
that the North is united and determined, they now "wish to be let
alone," and have given up the idea of attacking Washington or of
capturing Fort Pickens.  "But the Confederates (he says) are preparing
for the conflict, and when they have organised their forces they will
make, I am satisfied, a very resolute advance all along the line."</p>
               <p>After describing Montgomery, a city of 120,000 inhabitants, the
correspondent gives a stirring account of two negro sales which he
witnessed on his way to the Capitol, where the Southern Provisional
Congress was sitting.  The approaches to the Hall are described&#x2014;"the
floor and stairs deeply stained with tobacco-juice."  He thus paints
the interior:&#x2014;"Close to the table sit the two or three official
reporters and officers of the House.  The clerk sits at a desk above
this table, and on a platform behind him are the desk and chair of the
presiding officer or Speaker of the Congress.  Over his head hangs the
unfailing portrait of Washington, and a small engraving, in a black
frame, of a gentlemen unknown to me.  So much for the brick and mortar
part of the building.  Of its living furniture one might have more to
say than I have if he had fuller opportunities; but, as far as I could
judge, an assembly of more calm, determined, and judicial-looking men
could not be found in any country in the world.  No one who casts his
eye over those grave heads&#x2014;some massive and full, others keen,
compact, energetic&#x2014;could doubt that he was in the presence of men
with a great work on hand, and with great capabilities for the
execution of their task.  Seated in the midst of them, at a senator's
desk, I was permitted to 'assist,' in the French sense, at the
deliberations of the Congress.  Mr. Howell Cobb took the chair, and a
white-headed clergyman was called upon to say prayers, which he did
upstanding, with outstretched hands and closed eyes, by the side of
the Speaker. The prayer was long and sulphureous-one more pregnant
with gunpowder I never heard, nor could ought like it have been heard
since
               <q><lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,</l>
                  <l>Was beat with fist instead of a
stick.</l></lg></q>
               </p>
               <p>The rev. gentleman prayed that the Almighty
might be pleased to inflict on the arms of the United States such a
defeat that it might be the example of signal punishment for
ever&#x2014;that this President might be blessed, and that the other
President might be the other thing&#x2014;that the gallant, devoted young
soldiers who were fighting for their country might not suffer from
exposure to the weather or from the bullets of their enemies; and that
the base mercenaries who were fighting on the other side might come to
sure and swift destruction, and so on."</p>
               <p>An interview with
President Davis is thus described:&#x2014; "The President was engaged with
some gentlemen when I was presented to him, but he received me with
much kindliness of manner, and when they had left entered into
conversation with me for some time on general matters.  Mr. Davis is a
man of slight, sinewy figure, rather over the middle height, and of
erect, soldier-like bearing.  He is about fifty-five years of age; his
features are regular and well-defined, but the face is thin, and
marked on cheek and brow with many wrinkles, and is rather careworn
and haggard.  One eye is apparently blind, the other is dark,
piercing, and intelligent.  He was dressed very plainly in a light
grey summer suit.  In the course of conversation he gave an order for
the Secretary of War to furnish me with a letter as a kind of passport
in case of my falling in with the soldiers of any military posts who
might be indisposed to let me pass freely, merely observing that I had
been enough within the lines of camps to know what was my duty on such
occasions.  I subsequently was presented to Mr. Walker, the
Secretary-at-War, who promised to furnish me with the needful
documents before I left Montgomery.  In his room were General
Beauregard and several officers engaged over plans and maps,
apparently in a little council of war, which was, perhaps, not without
reference to the intelligence that the United States' troops were
marching on Norfolk Navy-yard, and had actually occupied Alexandria.
On leaving the Secretary I proceeded to the room of the
Attorney-General, Mr. Benjamin, a very intelligent and able man, whom
I found busied in preparations connected with the issue of letters of
marque.  Everything in the offices looked like earnest work and
business."</p>

               <p rend="center">THE FUTURE OF COTTON.
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">That</hi>
which feeds the industry of between three and four millions of our
fellow-countrymen can hardly become an uninteresting topic.  Present
circumstances, however, invest it with extraordinary interest.
England is at this moment in a very analogous position with regard to
a famine of cotton to that in which it stood with regard to the
cholera in 1831. . . . But this we do say, with the utmost confidence,
that the warning rung into our ears by the civil war in America is far
too distinct to be reasonably set at nought; and that, unless we take
effectual steps to secure ourselves and our interests against sudden
ruin, we shall have none but ourselves to blame for the ravages of so
fearful a calamity should it unhappily overtake us. <pb n="520"/> ...
If we are content to leave things for the future as they are at
present&#x2014;to receive cotton from the slaveholders of the Secession
States in the same proportion as we have been accustomed to do, or
even as we did no later back than 1860, when we imported ... 80 per
cent of our whole supply from America, 15 per cent from India, and 5
per cent from all other sources&#x2014;... we must make up our minds to
endure all the disadvantages, as well as to risk all the misfortunes,
which inevitably beset such an unwise and improvident arrangement.... The Southern States of America are the stronghold of negro slavery,
and cotton is the food upon which it principally thrives.  Those
States have recently formed themselves into a Confederate Republic,
the object of which is to conserve and to extend the slave system.
Now, quite apart from the interests of the slaves themselves, and
looking exclusively to those of freedom, morality, and religion, it
does seem to us to be an obvious duty, a duty enforced upon us just
now by the arrangements of Divine Providence, that we should
strenuously exert ourselves to defeat an experiment so largely fraught
with evils to humanity.  We can, if we will, make slave labour in the
cultivation of cotton well-nigh unprofitable; at any rate we can
reduce its profits so considerably by competition as to leave scarcely
an inducement to perpetuate the unnatural and demoralising system.  By
depriving America, as we might very soon do, of the command of the
European market for her staple article, we should crumble away the
strongest support upon which slavery rests, and probably compel the
planters of the South, in sheer self-defence, to make preparation for
a safe and early transition to a sounder social basis. . .

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">On</hi> the night of the 23rd
ult. a considerable portion of the Federal Army concentrated in
Washington, and consisting in its in entirety of 25,000 volunteers and
5000 regulars, made their first step in advance, and crossed the
Potomac into Virginia.  13,000 troops, consisting of six New York
regiments, the New Jersey and Michigan Brigades, and some of the
Washington volunteers, now occupy Alexandria, Arlington Heights, and
the junction of the Orange and Alexandria and Manassas Gap Railways.
They are commanded by Major-General Mansfield.  Colonel Ellsworth, the
creator of the famous regiment of Chicago Zouaves, and lately of the
New York Zouaves, formed from the fireman's brigade of that city, was
shot dead by the keeper of an hotel in Alexandria, while descending
the stairs of the hotel with a Secession flag in his hand which he had
taken from a flagstaff on the roof.  The assassin was immediately run
through the body by one of Colonel Ellsworth's men.  This makes the
second Colonel whom the Federal Army has lost in the course of the
week, Colonel Vosburgh, of the New York 71st Regiment, having died of
inflammation of the lungs, caused by exposure to the weather.</p>
               <p>The 1st Michigan Regiment surprised at the railroad station a troop
of Virginian calvary, handsomely uniformed. plumed, and accoutred.
They were placed on board a steamer and sent to Washington, "there to
be dealt with as traitors."</p>
               <p>The few Confederate troops in the
neighbourhood of Alexandria fled.</p>
               <p>General Butler, of
Massachusetts, who lately commanded at Annapolis and Baltimore, has
been ordered to Fort Monroe, which commands the entrance to Chesapeake
Bay.  Nine regiments, of 1200 men each, accompanied him thither.
General Butler left the fort on the 24th ult. for Sewell's Point, with
4000 men on propellers, for the purpose of demolishing the
fortifications between that place and Norfolk.  Sewell's Point is
situated at the mouth of Elizabeth River.  Commodore Stringham, with
two frigates, was to conduct the attack on the water side.  There were
eight batteries and 15,000 Confederate troops between Sewell's Point
and Norfolk, so that an engagement was expected.</p>
               <p>The
Confederate troops are in considerable force at Harper's Ferry.  Most
accounts place the number at from 9000 to 10,000, with thirty-five
pieces of cannon.  A battle was anticipated near this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">NAVAL OPERATIONS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Federal Fleet
in the Chesapeake has not been idle.  Commodore Stringham, of the
frigate Minnesota, stationed off Hampton Roads, reports the capture of
thirteen vessels, chiefly laden with tobacco&#x2014;among others of [sic] the
British barque Hiawatha&#x2014;which had delayed till the fifteen days' grace
had expired.  The steamer Freeborn on the 19th ult. destroyed a
Secessionist battery on Sewell's Point, at the mouth of Elizabeth
River.  Again no lives were lost, the Confederates scattering in all
directions.  The same steamer on the Potomac, about ten miles below
Fort Washington, captured two schooners with forty recruits for the
Confederate Army at Alexandria on board.</p>
               <p>Mysteriously enough,
the blockade of Charleston has been raised almost as soon as
instituted.  The blockading vessel, Niagara, has sped southward, and
is supposed to be off Savannah.  Several British ships have arrived in
port, and are obtaining cotton freights at the enormous rate of 2&#x00BC;d.
per pound.</p><!-- 00BC should display as 1/4, but print style -->
               <p>No new Southern seaport has been sealed up during
the week; but a New York paper gives a list of thirty-nine vessels
ready for blockading purposes, of which eighteen are regular
men-of-war and twenty-one irregular and chartered vessels. The only
seaports actually blockaded at last advices were those on the
Chesapeake.  The river blockade on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers has
become more stringent.  Hitherto provisions had been allowed to pass
between the North-western States and Kentucky, a non-seceding and
neutral Slave State.  As it was discovered that the seceding States
were supplying themselves with provisions through the Kentucky ports
of Paducah and Columbus, the order has been issued to allow only so
much provisions to pass into Kentucky as may reasonably be required
for the bona fide consumption of her people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Montgomery
Congress has ordered the emission of a loan for 50,000,000 dollars.
Three-fifths of the amount are to be issued in bonds bearing 8 per
cent interest, and redeemable in twenty years, and the remaining
20,000,000 dollars in Treasury notes without interest.  The latter
provision amounts to an issue of assignats.  As only 8,000,000 dollars
of the previous loan of 15,000,000 dollars were ever taken, it is not
likely that the eight per cent bonds will be any more successful.  The
State of North Carolina, whose credit has always been well maintained,
has voted 5,000,000 dollars for the war.  The Secession ordinance has
passed the Convention of this State unanimously.</p>
               <p>Arkansas was
admitted as one of the Confederate States by Congress on the 18th
ult.</p>
               <p>President Davis has communicated to Congress the
correspondence between Judge Campbell, the intermediary, and Secretary
Seward, to which he alluded in his recent Message.  From this it
appears that so late as April 7, the day before the Federal armament
left New York for Charleston, Mr. Seward wrote to Judge Campbell,
"Faith as to Sumter fully kept; wait and see."  A few days previously
he had said, "Before that letter reaches Montgomery, Sumter will be
evacuated."   In justification of Mr. Seward, it is said that the
evacuation of both Sumter and Pickens had been agreed upon by the
Cabinet, and that their views afterwards underwent a change when they
found Northern public opinion was hostile to this policy.  Congress
adjourned on the 22nd ult. till July 20. The low Tariff Bill had
passed.</p>
               <p>Fugitives from the far South describe business at
Charleston as almost annihilated.  Coin was very scarce. Gold only to
be had at the banks for the payment of duties, and there at 10 per
cent premium.  Butter was fetching 75 cents per pound (3s. 1&#x00BD;d.);
ham, beef, and mutton from 25 to 30 cents; and flour, 13 dollars per
barrel.  From Savannah the reports are similar.  Bacon, usually at 11
cents per pound, had risen to 18 cents.  Provisions were pouring
southwards in great quantities from Kentucky.  The main reliance of
the people was on the coming crops, which are looking splendid.  In
Georgia the wheat was already ripe, and the farmers gave out that they
would have enough for two years.  In Texas the grain harvest will be
equally fine.  Thus the south may be beaten in the field, crippled in
her finances, and prevented from raising and selling the next cotton
crop, but her exuberant soil and splendid climate will render all the
threats to "starve her out" futile.</p>
               <p>Texan advices say that
Colonel Von Dorn had succeeded in causing the surrender of the
remaining Federal troops in Texas.  The Texans under General Young
were pursuing Captain Montgomery, of Kansas fame, and the Federal
volunteers who had made a raid on the northern frontier of Texas.  The
baggage and ammunition trains were overtaken and seized, with some
beeves and horses.  Galveston is being fortified by the citizens.</p>
               <p>The President has appointed a day of public prayer, humiliation,
and fasting, in order to propitiate the goodwill of Heaven in their
conflict with the United States.</p>
               <p>The Virginians voted on the
two ordinances for seceding from the United, and joining the
Confederate, States on the 23rd ult.  No one doubts that both
ordinances were carried, the only interest manifested being the vote
in Western Virginia, where Unionists hope to obtain a majority.</p>
               <p>The Virginians are liberal enough to acknowledge that the finest
regiment of Confederate troops they have yet seen is one of 300
Indians from Cherokee County, North Carolina.  Not one of them is
under six feet, and the rifle has been their constant companion from
infancy.  They are stationed near Harper's Ferry.</p>
               <p>The
Richmond <title>Examiner</title> estimates that the Confederates have
150,000 improved firearms in their possession, of which 135,000 came
from the Federal arsenals.  In addition, there had been large arrivals
of arms at New Orleans.  These were shipped from Europe early in
April, and consist of over 200,000 muskets and rifles, and ample
supplies of powder, percussion-caps, and machines for making the
latter.</p>
               <p>There is no truth in the rumour that the remains of
the great Washington had been disturbed.  The announcement that the
Southern Congress would remove to Richmond is made without authority,
and is improbable, because Richmond is near the frontier, while
Montgomery is as safe from invasion as any place in the South can
be.</p>
               <p>President Lincoln has at length cut off all the postal
facilities to the seceded States, so we shall henceforth be more
isolated from the South than we have been for the last six weeks.
Tennessee is excepted from this decree, her people not having yet
ratified the secession ordinance. <pb n="521"/>  Mr. Davis's
Postmaster-General had previously announced that he would be ready to
assume the management of the Post Office by the 1st inst.; but, as no
postal treaty can exist between the belligerents, the Southern
Postmaster can only provide for domestic postal intercommunication. In
pursuance of the same design, Mr. Lincoln has prohibited the private
express companies from carrying any express matter, including letters,
further South than Washington.</p>

               <p>The people of Baltimore, although
acquiescent, are far from friendly to the Federal troops.  As the
latter march through the streets on their way to Washington they are
insulted by the populace.  The offer of Governor Hicks to raise four
Maryland regiments to defend Washington and Maryland only, but not to
be employed for the invasion of any other State, has been refused by
the Administration.  General Cadwallader, of Pennsylvania, commands
the department of Annapolis, in place of General Butler.</p>
               <p>Governor Magoffin, of Kentucky, has warned both the Federal and the
Confederate troops against making any movement on Kentucky soil, and
exhorts the Kentuckians to arm in defence of the State policy of
"armed neutrality."</p>
               <p>The latest intelligence brings us the
welcome news that the painful civil discord in Missouri has ended.  By
a compact between General Harney, commanding the Federal troops, and
General Price, commanding the State militia, the latter, comprising
4000 men, have been disbanded, and sent to their homes.  Thus Missouri
is saved to the Union, and her late rapid progress in material
prosperity will recommence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although no official announcement has been
made of the fact, the Washington correspondents of the New York
journals concur in stating that the Administration have agreed to the
propositions of the Congress of Paris relative to the rights of
neutrals and privateering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">THE NORTHERN
STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Northern journals are evidently very anxious
concerning the cooperation of the French and British Governments at
the present crisis, and their possible course of action.  The speech
of Lord John Russell acknowledging the Confederate States as
"belligerents" has created great and very unreasonable indignation.
Many journalists immediately jumped to the erroneous conclusion that
Great Britain would open her ports to Southern privateers, and many
were the threats that the United States were willing to confront in
arms both their old and their new enemy.  Englishmen were absurdly
accused of sympathising with the slaveowners.</p>
               <p>On the 21st
ult. the United States' Marshals, by order of the Government, made a
sudden an [sic] unexpected descent on every considerable
telegraph-office throughout the Free States, and seized the
accumulated despatches of the twelve months past.  This extraordinary
step was taken in order to obtain evidence of the operations of the
Southern politicians with their Northern sympathisers.  The seizures
were made at precisely the same time.</p>
               <p>The voluntary public
contributions to the war from the Governments, municipal corporations,
and individuals of the Free-Labour States amount to nearly 32,000,000
dollars.</p>
               <p>News from California to the 8th ult. represents the
enthusiasm for the Union as strong in that State, which some persons
thought would seize the opportunity to declare its independence.  The
shipments of treasure from San Francisco are smaller than usual,
forwarders being in dread of Southern privateers.</p>
               <p>Two grand
camps are about to be formed, where volunteers will be received and
drilled.  One camp will be on Staten Island, New York, and the other
at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
               <p>The regiment of British
volunteers has been raised, accepted, and inspected in New York.  Many
of the men and officers wear Crimean medals.  It is commanded by
Colonel Austin, late of H.B.M.'s 56th. Lieutenant-Colonel Torre, late
of the 17th; Major Elliot, late of the 15th; Adjutant Hazle, late of
the 2nd Rifle Brigade, are the principal officers.  Companies, of the
same nationality, from Troy and Canada have been mustered into its
ranks; and there is also a "Bannockburn Battalion," composed of Scots,
and under the command of James C. Robertson, late of her Majesty's
Forces in India.  On the banner of the legion are the words&#x2014;"We come
to redeem our forefathers," to which the President referred in his
interview with Colonel Austin as follows:&#x2014;"This legion has a
political significance which we cannot overlook.  It and its motto
will be received with cordiality by this nation.  Go ahead, Colonel,
and recruit!"</p>
               <p>It is even said that a regiment of Canadian
volunteers has been accepted with much pleasure by Mr. Lincoln!  What
has become of our neutrality laws?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">COMMERCIAL.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Western produce-merchants
are shipping 175,000 dollars' worth of grain to the East per diem.  It
follows that the export business from New York with Europe is very
active, although the freights have fallen from 1s. to 5d. per bushel.
The first month's operation of the Morrill tariff has not enriched the
Federal treasury. In April the duties collected under it at New York
were 1,643,261 dollars against 2,444,267 dollars in April of the
previous year under the reign of a lower tariff.  This tells a tale of
the decline of imports.</p>
               <p>Of the next cotton crop, Mr. Wright's
<title>Weekly Circular</title> says, "We are receiving accounts from
various sections of the cotton-growing districts which lead us to the
conclusion that less land has been put under cotton cultivation than
we had supposed, and that in numerous cases cotton has been plowed in
and corn substituted.  Our sources of information are naturally
curtailed to a large extent."</p>

quarantine, New York, at six o'clock on the morning of May 25, arrived
off the bar at the mouth of the Mersey about nine o'clock on Monday
evening.  It was announced that she would make her first appearance on
the waters of the Mersey about nine o'clock on the following morning,
and long before that hour the piers, roofs, and other available spots
on both the Lancashire and Cheshire banks of the river were covered
with spectators.  As the noble vessel (evidently very lightly laden)
gradually crept up the stream headed by a small tug, her vast size,
which dwarfed the surrounding craft including the City of Baltimore,
far surpassed all expectation.  The river steamers sailing round her
were filled with eager crowds of sightseers.  At intervals both the
screw and the paddles were used, and, after "taking it easy" for
upwards of half an hour, the great ship finally settled down at her
anchors in the Sloyne.  The Great Eastern brings 212 passengers and a
cargo of upwards of 3000 tons of flour, grain, and provisions.  During
the voyage the screw was the chief propelling power employed, and the
highest speed obtained was 355 knots in the twenty-four hours.  Her
passage across the Atlantic was exceedingly pleasant, and she
"behaved" herself most satisfactorily.  Little or no vibration was
felt.  Ere the voyage terminated resolutions were adopted by the
passengers expressing their high satisfaction with the internal
arrangements of the vessel, and also with her qualities for
navigation.  These resolutions describe her as <hi rend="italic">par
excellence</hi> the most desirable ship for ladies and
families.</p>

Government are, as you are aware, desirous of observing the strictest
neutrality in the contest which appears to be imminent between the
United States and the so-styled Confederate States of North America;
and, with the view more effectually to carry out this principle, they
propose to interdict the armed ships, and also the privateers of both
parties, from carrying prizes made by them into the ports, harbours,
roadsteads, or waters of the United Kingdom, or of any of her
Majesty's colonies or possessions abroad.  I have accordingly to
acquaint your Lordships that the Queen has been pleased to direct that
orders in conformity with the principles above stated forthwith be
addressed to all proper authorities in the United Kingdom, and to her
Majesty's naval and other authorities in all quarters beyond the
United Kingdom, for their guidance in the circumstances.  I have,
&#x0026;c., (Signed) <hi rend="smallcap">J. Russell</hi>."  Similar letters have been addressed to
the Secretaries of State for India, War, and the Colonies.&#x2014;The French
Government has determined to act on their old law, which is in
substance that no privateers can sell their prizes in French ports, or
remain there for more than twenty-four hours.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We
have important intelligence from the States, the latest dates being to
the 1st inst. from New York.  The North, as will be seen by the
accompanying details, is preparing in right earnest for the contest;
and on the part of the South such casual glimpses as we catch of its
doings show us that a like activity prevails.  When the crisis arrives
it will evidently be terrible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">BELLIGERENT
OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Virginia is still the main
theatre of the war.  On the 24th the pickets of the Federal troops
near Alexandria were attacked by the Confederates, and it was thought
in Washington that an engagement was taking place.  Troops were
hurried over the Potomac, but found that their services were not
wanted, as the enemy had retired the moment the Federals showed
themselves in force.  The regiments stationed on Arlington heights are
throwing up intrenchments, the 69th (Irish) having already formed an
earthwork one mile long and seven feet high.</p>
               <p>The Confederates
are fortifying themselves at Manassas Gap, a station twenty-seven
miles from Alexandria on the railway connecting Richmond with the
important military post at Harper's Ferry.</p>
               <p>There is no change
in the condition of things at Harper's Ferry, except that the
Confederates have blasted a lot of rock on to the Baltimore and Ohio
line at the Point of Rocks, ten miles east of the ferry.  A telegram
to Halifax announces that some Ohio regiments have taken possession of
Grafton, in North-western Virginia&#x2014;an important point, whence the
Parkersburg and Wheeling branches of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad
diverge.</p>
               <p>A Federal regiment had landed at Acquia Creek, a
point on the southern bank of the Potomac, without opposition.</p>
               <p>The most important advance reported by the last mails is that of
General Butler, who, with a force of 2500 men from Fort Monroe, had
made their way up Hampton Roads, and intrenched themselves at New
Point, which is about six miles from Hampton.  This body commands the
mouth of the James River, which is the water route to Richmond; but
General Butler is of opinion that no general movement should be made
in this quarter with less than 15,000 men.  At Fort Monroe he has only
6000 at present.  When he is reinforced he will probably attack
Norfolk and Sewell's Point simultaneously.</p>
               <p>Thus Virginia is
invaded at three points&#x2014;in the east, at Norfolk; in the centre, at
Alexandria and Acquia Creek; in the west, at Grafton.  The
Confederates are concentrated at four points&#x2014;Norfolk, Harper's Ferry,
Manassas Gap, and Richmond, the capital of the State.</p>
               <p>The
blockading squadron in the Chesapeake reports the number of their
captures at twenty-three.  The Minnesota had left the Chesapeake to
renew the blockade at Charleston; and a telegram to Halifax announces
that New Orleans, the most important Southern port, was sealed up on
the 28th ult.</p>
               <p>The attitude of the Federal Generals towards
the slaves in Virginia is worth observing. General Sandford,
commanding the troops in the centre, has issued a proclamation
offering protection to all <hi rend="italic">loyal</hi> citizens and
their <hi rend="italic">property</hi>, which means slaves.  General
Butler refuses to deliver up three fugitive slaves, on the ground that
they may be employed by the enemy in throwing up earthworks, and so
are contraband of war, unless the owner will come forward and swear
allegiance to the United States. On hearing of this decision the
slaves of the vicinity commenced flocking in to the camp at Fort
Monroe.  Soon General Butler found himself surrounded by 450
fugitives.  He made application to the Government to know what to do
with them.  The Secretary of War replied that the General must detain
them for the present and not allow them to escape; set them to work,
and keep an account of the amount of work done and the cost of their
keep.  Their ultimate disposition would be a matter for determination
hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi rend="center">CONFEDERATE STATES.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Twenty counties in Western Virginia gave large majorities against
the Secession Ordinance.  In Eastern or Upland Tennessee the
Unionists, under the lead of Emerson Etheridge and Andrew Johnson, are
active in denouncing the folly of seceding.</p>
               <p>The Legislature
of Arkansas has passed a law ordering all citizens to pay the debts
due to Northern creditors to the State Treasurer, and to no one
else.</p>
               <p>All idea of attacking Fort Pickens seems to have been
abandoned.  The causes which have prompted the relinquishment of this
project have been well stated by the special correspondent of the
<title>Times</title>.</p>
               <p>The New Orleans papers report the
capture of seven Northern prizes by some of the privateer steamers
which constitute the small navy of the Confederates.  The cotton ships
detained on the bar of the Mississippi got off before the arrival of
the blockading squadron.</p>
               <p>A negro conspiracy was recently
discovered in Des Arc, Arkansas.  One white man and three negroes were
hanged, three more negroes banished, and a number of others was
severely whipped.</p>
               <p>In Tennessee the hay and corn crop is
reported to be attacked by worms; but the wheat crop is safe.  Mr.
Wright's <title>Circular</title> speaks thus of the coming cotton
crop:&#x2014;"The growing crop does not promise well so far; too much rain
has fallen.  The plant looks sickly, in such portion at least of the
cotton region as has been passed recently by travellers.  The idea is
general that a large crop has not been planted; that in former years
the land in corn was only seen here and there, whereas this season
corn is seen in greater and cotton in less abundance."</p>
               <p>The
mails to and from all the Seceding States, except Western Virginia and
Tennessee, were to be stopped by the Federal Government on the 31st
ult.  This measure will henceforth cut off the connection between the
<title>Times</title> and its special correspondent, unless Mr.
Russell's ingenuity open up a new route.</p>

               <p>The Baltimore correspondent of the
<title>New York Tribune</title> writes of the Marylanders, "No one is
to be trusted who belongs to the soil, except it be the Republicans,
but they have been peeled, and scattered, and driven out by the
conduct of the (city) Government towards them."</p>
               <p>A collision
between the civil and military authorities has already come to pass in
Maryland.  The Federal troops arrested one John Merryman for having
burnt a railway bridge during the tumultuous days of April.  Merryman
pleads the authorisation of the Governor of the State; nevertheless he
is arrested, and lodged in Fort M'Henry.  His friends apply to Chief
Justice Taney, of the Supreme Court of the United States, for a writ
of habeas corpus.  The Chief Justice issues it.  General Cadwallader
refuses to obey it, and so the matter stands.  The United States'
Constitution is suspended for the present in Maryland.</p>

has instructed a commission to examine the telegraphic despatches
recently seized by the Government, and after having selected those of
a treasonable character, to reseal and return those relating to mere

Washington to be examined.</p>
               <p>The President has raised Col.

has effected his loan for 9,000,000 dollars at the following rates.
He accepted all bids for the Six per Cent Bonds placed at 85 and
upwards, and awarded the remainder to the bidders for Treasury notes
at or above par.  There were awarded of the Bonds 6,753,000 dollars;
of the Treasury notes, 2,241,000.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The Northern journals are made still more angry
than before by the Queen's proclamation of neutrality.  The <title>New
York Times</title>, an influential journal, states that England had
more right to recognise the Hungarian nation during the revolution of
1848 and 1849 than the <pb n="545"/> present Southern Confederacy.
"Nothing that England can now offef [sic] of sympathy, or hereafter of
pious congratulation at the triumph or [sic] liberty and government,
can remove the conviction implanted in the minds of our people of the
base selfishness, the canting hypocrisy, of her governing classes. She
has lost in American affairs a golden opportunity of centuries, and it
will never come again."  The editor concludes a long article by
stating that centuries of kind relations will never wipe from American
memories the recollection of that crisis of supreme danger to the very
existence of liberty and law in America in which the English people
had nothing to offer but fears for their cotton supply and sympathy
with American slaveholders.</p>
               <p>The same journal is almost as
bitter against France for her neutral attitude, but the tirade is not
so long.  It says:&#x2014;"This willful ignoring of the lofty claims of the
American Government, this indifferent choosing between Christ and
Barabbas, will not strengthen the regard we are accustomed to
entertain for the people and Government of France.  It might even
appear advisable to withdraw the exequatur of all the French Consuls
in the Seceding States.  Our business in this deplorable contest is to
prove that we have a Government&#x2014;a proof that seems to be as much
needed at Paris as at New Orleans."</p>
               <p>The Boston journals are
more moderate that those of New York, and maintain a better temper and
higher tone.</p>
               <p>The Legislature of Iowa desires to raise money
to equip her regiments, but finds that the constitution of the State
forbids them to sanction a loan for more than 250,000 unless to repel
invasion.  Under these circumstances the legislators are trying hard
to persuade themselves that an invasion from Missouri is imminent.</p>

               <p>Overland advices from San
Francisco are to the 18th ult. Trade was fairly active.  The rate of
insurance on gold and silver bound for Europe or the Atlantic States
was 10 per cent.  Both Houses of the Legislature had passed
resolutions pledging the fealty of the State to the Federal
Government, and its readiness to comply with any requisition for aid
in suppressing the insurrection.  Union meetings were being held
almost nightly in all the principal towns and cities. Speeches and
resolutions are invariably in favour of a vigorous war policy.
Efforts were being made to organise a company of volunteers in San
Francisco, to tender their service to the Government[.]  A similar

newly-appointed Minister of the Federal States of America to this

 His grandfather, Mr. John Adams, who was elected the second President
of the United States, on the retirement of Washington in 1797, having
been previously Vice-President, was the first Ambassador of that
Republic to Great Britain, in 1785; and Mr. John Quincey [sic] Adams,
who was President in 1825, and Ambassador to England in 1815&#x2014;having
before that filled a similar office at the Hague, Berlin, and St.
Peterburg&#x2014;was the father of the distinguished gentleman whose
individual merits, apart from his hereditary title, have won for him
an appointment which, at the present moment, is one not merely of
distinction but of great responsibility.  All his antecedents are in
favour of an opinion as to his entire capability of worthily
performing the delicate duties of his office.</p>

               <p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JUNE</hi> 15, 1861.
               </p>
               <p>...The Emperor of the French has issued a
               proclamation on the subject of
America.  His Majesty declares that, considering the state of peace
between France and the United States, he resolves to be neutral in the
strife between the Government of the Union and the States claiming to
form a particular Confederation, and he notifies that neither armed
ship nor privateer on either side shall remain with prizes in French
waters more than twenty-four hours.  The usual cautions to Frenchmen
against engaging in the war are given.  We shall see whether this
counterpart of our own declaration draws down upon France the
indignation which a certain portion of the American journals have seen
fit to express against England for having asserted her right to be
neutral.  The most absurd arguments are adduced against us, and, among
others, we are told that in the Indian War the Republic was in no
hurry to recognise the belligerent rights of sepoys.  It does not
speak well for the critical habits of newspaper readers in America
that such childish nonsense can even be put into type.  Where is the
parallel? and what would it have signified to England if every State
in the Union had declared that the murderers of Cawnpore were patriots
fighting for nationality?  We have carefully abstained from giving the
least countenance to either principle involvedi n [sic] the strife in
America, and we hope to be able to continue "letting both parties
alone with the utmost severity."  Rumours of expected collisions still
supply the journals with tremendous headings to very tame columns;
and, in truth, the papers are not exactly covering themselves with
glory either by the exactness of their news or the elevation of their
style.  At this moment the value to the Republic of a single newspaper
edited on the English principle&#x2014;that is to say, one calmly and
thoughtfully written, and from which all news that is not verified is
eliminated, or given with a brand of untrustworthiness upon it&#x2014;would
be almost inconceivable.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcap">New York</hi>, May 24.</p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">My</hi> first letter must necessarily be
somewhat brief, as the short time I have allowed myself here has been
occupied in looking about me and making the few sketches you will
receive with this.  When I reach the head-quarters of the Federal army
I shall make up to your readers the scantiness of the present
supply.</p>
               <p>But a few days since I was standing on the
landing-stage at Liverpool, waiting for the tender to take me on board
the fine ocean streamer moored some distance up the stream.  Then I
had a confused notion of perils to be encountered on a tempest-tossed
sea, and, old traveller as I am, used to knocking about the world, I
experienced an undefined feeling which may be construed into an
acknowledgment of the potency of the vast Atlantic for evil.  I
recollected the fate of the Arctic, the Pacific, and other steamers;
but then, again, I was comforted at the idea of making the voyage in a
Cunard ship.  This company has never lost a vessel or a life by
shipwreck, and their service is performed with a regularity that
reflects great credit on the able officers who command the noble
fleet&#x2014;the finest in our merchant navy. It seems now almost like a
dream, so gently have I been rocked across the turbulent deep, and,
like Jupiter, I have formed an affection for the beautiful Europa, in
whose arms I have been safely carried to the far-off land of our
cousins.  With an officer like Captain Anderson the monotony of a
twelve-days' voyage is scarcely perceptible; his resources for the
amusement of the passengers were inexhaustible.  In addition to being
a thorough seaman, Captain Anderson is a savant, and a man to whom all
the mysteries of the deep are familiar, and to whom wayside objects
are matters of study, and who reads in stones sermons of the mighty
past.  These digressions will, I am sure, be pardoned me: there are
many of your readers who may some day pay a visit to America, and it
is as well they should have the benefit of my experience, and so
choose the right ships.</p>
               <p>On landing at Boston I was surprised
at the enthusiasm displayed by the people of the North after what I
had heard in England of their apathy.  Everywhere the stars and
stripes of the Union floated in the breeze, while every man wore a
patriotic badge in his buttonhole.  Volunteers from all parts thronged
the streets on their way down South, and this city of storekeepers and
students had become, so to speak, a military colony.  Nor is it
surprising that a population whose forefathers were the first to
assert their independence should rise en masse to preserve the
integrity of the Constitution of which their ancestors laid the
foundation.  Boston was the first to unfurl the national flag, and
Boston should be the last to see it hauled down.  I have said this
town of storekeepers and <hi rend="italic">students</hi>.   Boston has
always been famous for its learning, and may be considered the modern
Athens of the United States.  Shortly after 1630, the year in which
the English Puritans colonised this portion of the American soil, it
was enacted that when any township should increase to the number of
one hundred families it should set up a grammar-school.  This
wholesome provision has never been neglected, and schools are as
plentiful in Boston now as are bar-rooms in the other cities of the
States.  In the immediate vicinity of the town is the suburb of
Cambridge, devoted exclusively to scholastic purposes, though now its
lecture-halls and study-walks are deserted: the student has cast aside
his books and begirt him with the sword.</p>
               <p>In the cars that
took me from Boston to New York I made my first acquaintance with a
genuine Yankee.  On the seat beside me sat a hard-featured,
sallow-complexioned, tobacco-chewing, bright-eyed, shirt-becollared,
wide-awake-covered individual, who, as soon as we had quitted the
station, commenced a conversation with me.  It ran very much as
follows:&#x2014;"I conclude, Sirre, you're a stranger in these parts?"  To
this I bowed affirmatively.  "I guess yer aint been long in the States
neither; its an almighty big country, aint it?"  Having assured my
fellow-traveller of my unqualified approbation of all I had witnessed,
there was a short pause, during which he employed himself in cutting
from a cake of honeydew a small plug about half an inch square; this
went to replace one which he deposited unpleasantly near my feet.
Having rolled the new quid into a convenient corner of his cheek, he
resumed the interrupted conversation.  In short, in the course of half
an hour he had imperceptibly pumped me of my name, how long I had been
in the States, how long I contemplated staying, where I was going to,
and a host of other matters I should never have dreamt of telling.

               <p>quisitorial proceeding, and becoming aware of it when too late, I
could not help remarking to my friend that I thought him an
exceedingly clever fellow to have found out all about me, when I
really knew nothing whatever of him.  I proposed that as I had given
him my name, and told him where I was from, that he should do the same
by me, so that in the course of my wanderings I might have a chance of
renewing the acquaintance, which I hoped would be pleasant to both of
us.  "Waal, I guess, stranger, there won't be no harm in that; and
I'll give it yer all, right away.  I'm from down east"&#x2014;mentioning
some place in Maine&#x2014;"war they prise up the sun with a crowbar every
morning.  I'm interested in blue noses"&#x2014;these I afterwards learnt to
be a species of potato&#x2014;"and I conclude, after all, I wunt tell yer my
name, consarn it."  To this last resolve I objected, and, hoping to
draw him out, I hazarded the suggestion that possibly he was ashamed
of it.  "Ashamed on it, stranger! no I aint. But, as you're a B[r]itisher, I didn't want to go and urt yer feelings.  My name is
Bunker, Sirre&#x2014;Bunker-hill, Sirre&#x2014;war we wallopped yer.  Now don't
look almighty skeared;" and with this avowal, and more converse, we
journeyed on to New York.</p>
               <p>I could easily believe myself to be
in Paris or some other city devoted to military display, instead of
New York, the commercial emporium of the North.  From morning to night
nothing is heard but the sound of the drum or the martial strains from
trumpet and bugle, as regiment after regiment passes on its way to the
seat of war throughstreets [sic] crowded with a maddened population.
All trade is at a standstill.  Store after store down Broadway has
been turned into the head-quarters of Anderson's Zouaves , Wilson's
Boys, the Empire City Guard, and hosts of corps too numerous or too
eccentric in their names for me to recollect.  Verily, a cosmopolitan
army is assembled here.  As one walks he is jostled by soldiers
dressed in the uniforms of the Zouaves de la Garde, the Chasseurs
&#x00E0; Pied, Infanterie de la Ligne, and other French regiments&#x2014;so great,
apparently, is the admiration of our cousins for everything Gallic.  I
must confess I should prefer to see more nationality.  In justice,
however, to the men, I cannot do otherwise than express my unqualified
approval of the material out of which the North is to make her patriot
army.  Many of those I have seen marching through the streets appear
already to have served in the field, so admirably do they bear
themselves in their new r&#x00F4;les.  The very children have become tainted
with the military epidemic, and little toddling Zouaves, three and
four years old, strut, armed to the teeth, at their nurses'
apronstrings.  As I write I have a corps of chasseurs composed of all
the small boys in the hotel exercising and skirmishing in the corridor
outside my room; the shrill words of command from the juvenile Colonel
pierce through and through my ears, and distract my attention
terribly.</p>
               <p>There is not a house that does not display Union
colours of some kind; there is not a steeple ever so lofty that is not
surmounted by a star-spangled banner; there is not a man nor woman in
the city that does not wear a patriotic badge of some kind.  It is a
mighty uprising of a united people determined to protect their flag to
the last.  In a future letter I shall enter into the merits of the
quarrel, as I may be able to ascertain them, which now divides two
branches of the same family.	</p>

the Federal troops from Washington on Alexandria on the night of the
23rd ult. was marked by a sad event&#x2014;the assassination of a young man
of great promise, who had already achieved fame&#x2014;Colonel Ellsworth.
He was shot by the proprietor of an hotel as he was carrying
downstairs a Secession flag. His regiment was at once wild with rage,
and it was with difficulty it was prevented from burning the town.
The assassin was killed on the spot.  Colonel Ellsworth was a man of
much force of character, and of especial genius for organisation and
military drill; he was, in fact, the originator of the Zouave drill in
the United States.  When the war began it occurred to him that the
firemen of New York would furnish excellent material for a military
corps of this description: he at once proposed the matter, and, the
consent of the authorities being given, a regiment was immediately
formed and conveyed to Washington. In a sort of reckless courage this
class of men have hardly their equals anywhere.  The skill of Colonel
Ellsworth soon added the advantages of skill and discipline, and the
force had already become as formidable a one as any in the field.  He
was greatly loved by his men, and seems to have been a man of
exemplary life.</p>

o'clock yesterday (May 23), embarked on three tugs, and arrived at the
foot of East Fifteenth-street at four o'clock.  The baggage and tents
of the Zouaves occupied a fourth tug.  On disembarking the regiment
proceeded to Fourteenth-street, thence down Broadway to the City Hall,
where they were reviewed.  A number of ladies and gentlemen occupied
the balcony.  After going through a parade-drill the Zouaves marched
up Broadway, through White and North Moore streets, to the pier, where
the Alabama lay awaiting their arrival to convey them to Fort Monro
[sic].  The march through broadway [sic] was an ovation, the splendid
appearance of the men eliciting the most enthusiastic cheers and other
demonstrations of satisfaction from the multitude that lined the side
walks and filled the windows along the route.  All concurred in the
opinion that the Advance Guard is one of the finest regiments that
have left New York since the commencement of the war.  The brown faces
of the men indicted that they had not spared their complexions, and
the steady martial tramp gave evidence of long and careful drills.
Before reaching the dock the regiment halted, unfixed bayonets, and
made preparations for an unobstructed embarkation, which took place
without confusion and in a very short space of time."</p>

Norfolk by General Butler.   Many of his late reinforcem[e]nts are
destitute of arms, and his Commissariat is very badly served.  Hence
his troops have taken to foraging for themselves, and much damage has
been done to private property in the neighbourhood of Fort Monroe.</p>
               <p>The most important movement of the Federal forces since our last
publication has been the advance of General M'Lellan in North-Western
Virginia at the head of the loyal Virginian and Ohio troops.  In his
address to the people of Western Virginia he promises protection to
their property, and not only that, but also that he "will crush with
an iron hand any attempt at insurrection" on the part of the slaves.
On the night of the 2nd inst., during a drenching rain, he pushed
forward two regiments from Grafton to Philippa, a little town in
Barbour County, twenty miles south of Grafton, and surprised a camp of
Confederates there, 200 strong.  The enemy were routed with a loss of
fifteen killed and a large amount of arms, ammunition, horses, camp
equipage, &#x0026;c.  The Federals were continuing the pursuit.  The only
casualty on the part of the latter was the wounding, but not mortally,
of Colonel Kelly, of the 1st Virginian Volunteers.  The Ohio regiments
are received enthusiastically by the people of trans-Alleghanian [sic]
Virginia.</p>
               <p>The only adventure of the Federal army in the centre
of Virginia has been a foray of cavalry into Fairfax Courthouse.  They
retired with a loss of six men.  Hearing that two of the captured were
to be hanged by the Confederates, the Federalists made another charge
into the town and rescued their comrades.</p>

               <p>President Davis, accompanied by
Secretary Toombs, Colonel Wigfall, and Mr. Todd, brother of Mrs.
President Lincoln (who is an ardent champion of Southern
independence), left Montgomery on Sunday, the 26th ult., en route for
Richmond, the capital of Virginia.  Mr. Davis, being in a weak state
of health, was desirous of making his journey to the North as private
as possible, but he was frustrated in this by the enthusiasm of the
people, who insisted on his showing himself at each station.  Loud
calls were then made for Toombs and Wigfall, who were compelled to
humour the crowd with speeches.  On arriving at Richmond the Southern
President was treated to a public reception, and in a short, warlike
speech complimented his hearers by assuring them they were "the last,
best hope of liberty."</p>
               <p>The new low tariff of the Confederacy has
been published.  Although while the blockade lasts it is a nullity, it
may be interesting to note what terms the new Government offers to
European commerce.  Articles of European manufacture are admitted at a
duty of 15 per cent ad valorem.  Books and magazines at 10 per cent.
This is much lower than the "Morrill" tariff which now prevails in the
United States.</p>
               <p>The price of provisions and clothing continues to rise.
 At Richmond the clothing stores are exhausted of their stocks, and
must henceforth rely on the small domestic factories, which cannot
nearly supply the demand.  Paper is getting so scarce that Southern
newspapers are being curtailed in size, and will soon have to stop
altogether unless a home manufacture of paper can be forthwith
created.  Coin is so scarce that Mr. W.H. Russell mentions the case of
a New Orleans gentleman who, wanting 1600 dols. for travelling
purposes, was obliged to give therefore, in addition to his note, the
collateral security of 10,000 dols. worth of the new Confederate
Stock.</p>
               <p>General Beauregard has gone to Tennessee to organise the forces
at Memphis, and attend to the defence of the lower Mississippi.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Roger B. Taney, of Maryland, Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, has decided in the case of
Merriman that the President has no power to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus, much less to delegate that power to any military officer.  The
judgment, which is both long and important, concludes thus:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>I can
only say that, if the authority which the Constitution has confided to
the Judiciary Department and judicial officers may thus, upon any
pretext and under any circumstances, be usurped by the military power
at its discretion, the people of the United States are no longer
living under a Government of laws, but every citizen holds life,
liberty, and property at the will and pleasure of the army-officer in
whose military district he may happen to be found.  In such a case my
duty was too plain to be mistaken.  I have exercised all the power
which the Constitution and laws confer on me, but that power has been
resisted by a force too strong for me to overcome.  I shall order all
the proceedings in this case, with my opinion, to be filed and
recorded, and direct the clerk to transmit a copy to the President of
the United States.  It will then remain for that high officer, in
fulfilment of his constitutional obligation, to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed, to determine what measures he will take
to cause the civil process of the United States to be respected and
enforced.</p>
               <p>The Northern journals are indignant at this decision,
denounce the Chief Justice as a traitor, and call upon the President
to disregard the judgment of the Court.</p>
               <p>As large quantities of
provisions were moving southward along the Kentucky railroads, the
people of the North-west will allow no more to be sent into Kentucky
than are sufficient for her domestic wants.</p>
               <p>In Missouri General Harney
has been replaced in the command of the Federal forces in that State
by General Lyon, a thorough-going anti-Secessionist.</p>

               <p>Senator Douglas, of Illinois, the leader of the Northern
Democrats, died in Chicago on the 3rd inst.  He had but just completed
his forty-eighth year.  His death at this juncture is much deplored by
the Northerners of all parties, and has called forth many
manifestations of public mourning.</p>
               <p>The New York 7th Regiment returned
to that city on the 1st inst.  The Highland Guard left for Washington
on the following day.  The British legion has been broken up by the
authorities of the State of New York, and its best-drilled companies
incorporated with the 30th Regiment.  This step was taken in
consequence of the anti-British feeling rife in New York, roused by
the tone of the English journals and English statesmen.</p>
               <p>Many of the
Northern States are in the money market for loans for war purposes.</p>
               <p>The <title>New York Tribune</title> is an honourable exception to the mass of its
contemporaries in refusing to indulge in foolish and wicked tirades
against England.  In its issue of the 4th inst. it says:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>The tone of
the debate in the House of Lords, and of European official utterances
generally, is marked by eminent dignity, moderation, and anxiety to
give no just cause of offence to our Government and people.  Has this
evident desire to maintain amicable relations with us been fairly met
on this side of the water?  We think not.  In many quarters a
disposition to take offense at trifles and aggravate slight
differences into causes of serious quarrel has been manifested. . . .
The doctrine that a Government in fact is to be regarded as a
Government of right is emphatically of American origin.  Up to this
year we have steadfastly commended and adhered to it.  We cannot
creditably repudiate it at the very first instance in which it is
brought to bear on ourselves.</p>
               <p>The <title>Tribune</title> defends Lord John Russell,
and admits that had the Irish people driven out the British Government
from Ireland, and organised an independent Government, the Irish would
have been at once recognised by the Government and people of the
United States, not merely as belligerents, but as an independent
nation.</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> <title>Times</title>
continues to receive letters from its Special Correspondent in the
Southern States of America.  On the 23rd ult. Mr. Russell writes as
follows from New Orleans:&#x2014;</p>
               <p>The Congress at Montgomery, having sat with
closed doors almost since it met, has now adjourned till the 20th of
July, when it will reassemble at Richmond, in Virginia, which is thus
designated, for the time, capital of the Confederate States of
America.  Richmond, the principal city of the old dominion, is about
100 miles in a straight line south-by-west of Washington.  The rival
capitals will thus be in very close proximity by rail and by steam, by
land and by water.  The movement is significant.  It will tend to
hasten a collision between the forces which are collected on the
opposite sides of the Potomac.  Hitherto Mr. Jefferson Davis has not
evinced all the sagacity and energy, in a military sense, which he is
said to possess.  It was bad strategy to menace Washington before he
could act.  His Secretary of War, Mr. Walker, many weeks ago, in a
public speech, announced the intention of marching upon the capital.
If it was meant to do so, the blow should have been struck silently.
If it was not intended to seize upon Washington, the threat had a very
disastrous effect on the South, as it excited the North to immediate
action, and caused General Scott to concentrate his troops on points
which present many advantages in the face of any operations which may
be considered necessary along the lines either of defence or attack.
The movement against the Norfolk Navy-yard strengthened Fortress
Monroe, and the Potomac and Chesapeake were secured to the United
States.  The fortified ports held by the Virginians and the
Confederate States' troops are not of much value as long as the
streams are commanded by the enemy's steamers; and General Scott has
shown that he has not outlived either his reputation or his vigour by
the steps, at once wise and rapid, he has taken to curb the
malcontents in Maryland, and to open his communications through the
city of Baltimore.  Although immense levies of men may be got together
on both sides for purposes of local defence or for State operations,
it seems to me that it will be very difficult to move these masses in
regular armies.  The men are not disposed for regular lengthened
service, and there is an utter want of field-trains, equipment, and
commissariat, which cannot be made good in a day, a week, or a month.</p>
               <p>The bill passed by the Montgomery Congress entitled "An Act to Raise
an Additional Military Force to serve during the War" is, in fact, a
measure to put in the hands of the Government the control of irregular
bodies of men, and to bind them to regular military service.  With all
their zeal, the people of the South will not enlist.  They detest the
recruiting sergeant, and Mr. Davis knows enough of war to feel
hesitation in trusting himself in the field to volunteers.  The bill
authorises Mr. Davis to accept volunteers who may offer their services
without regard to the place of enlistment, "to serve during the war,
unless sooner discharged."  They may be accepted in companies, but Mr.
Davis is to organise them into squadrons, battalions, or regiments,
and the appointment of field and staff officers is reserved especially
to him.  The company officers are to be elected by the men of the
company; but here again Mr. Davis reserves to himself the right of
veto, and will only commission those officers whose election he
approves.</p>
               <p>The absence of cavalry and the deficiency of artillery may
prevent either side obtaining any very decisive results in one
engagement, but no doubt there will be great loss whenever these large
masses of men are fairly opposed to each other in the field.  Of the
character of the Northern regiments I can say nothing from actual
observation, nor have I yet seen in any place such a considerable
number of the troops of the Confederate States moving together as
would justify me in expressing any opinion with regard to their
capacity for organised movements such as regular troops in Europe are
expected to perform.  An intelligent and trustworthy observer, taking
one of the New York State militia regiments as a fair specimen of the
battalions which will fight for the United States, gives an account of
them which leads me to the conclusion that such regiments are much
superior when furnished by the country districts to those raised in
the towns and cities.  It appears in this case, at least, that the
members of the regular militia companies in general send substitutes
to the ranks.  Ten of these companies form the regiment, and in nearly
every instance they have been doubled in strength by volunteers.</p>
               <p>Reverting to Montgomery, one may say without offence that its claims
to be the capital of a Republic which asserts that it is the richest
and believes that it will be the strongest in the world are not by any
means evident to a stranger.  Its central position, which has
reference rather to a map than to the hard face of matter, procured
for it a distinction to which it had no other claim.  The
accommodations which suited the modest wants of a State Legislature
vanished or were transmuted into barbarous inconveniences by the
pressure of a Central Government, with its offices, its departments,
and the vast crowd of applicants which flocked thither to pick up such
crumbs of comfort as could be spared from the Executive table.  Never
shall I forget the dismay of myself and of the friends who were
travelling with me on our arrival at the Exchange Hotel under
circumstances with some of which you are already acquainted.  With us
were men of high position, members of Congress, senators,
ex-governors, and General Beauregard himself.  But to no one was
greater accommodation extended then could be furnished by a room held,
under a sort of ryot-warree tenure, in common with a community of
strangers.  My room was shown to me.  It contained four large fourpost
beds, a rickety table, and some chairs of infirm purpose and
fundamental unsoundness.  The floor was carpet-</p>

window afforded no ungrateful means of ventilation.  One gentleman sat
in his shirt-sleeves at the table, reading the account of the
marshalling of the Highlanders at Edinburgh in the Abbotsford edition
of Sir Walter Scott; another, who had been wearied, apparently, by
writing numerous applications to the Government for some military
post, of which rough copies lay scattered around, came in, after
refreshing himself at the bar, and occupied one of the beds, which,
by-the-by, were ominously provided with two pillows a piece.  Supper
there was none for us in the house; but a search in an outlying street
enabled us to discover a restaurant, where roasted squirrels and baked
opossums figured as luxuries in the bill of fare.  On our return we
found that due preparation had been made in the appartment [sic] by
the addition of three mattresses on the floor.  The beds were occupied
by unknown statesmen and warriors and we all slumbered and snored in
friendly concert till morning.</p>

               </p>
               <p>...Though Fort Pickens is not to be
attacked by the American Secessionists, they take much pains to
impress upon the world that they are still eager for conflict, and
they show continued energy in mustering, drilling, and fortifying.
They have, however, very great difficulties to contend with, for, in
addition to the hindrances caused by the insubordination and dislike
of military discipline which are common to the American character,
they have to watch the servile part of the population of the South,
and do not appear to find very ready recruits, except among the class
personally interested in the preservation of the existing system.
But, despite all this, there is a stern determination to resist the
violence of the North, and the struggle must be a fearful one, come
when it may.  In the Federal force there is also to be found,
notwithstanding the unqualified vaunting of the press, much that
causes great dissatisfaction to the real soldiers of the Republic, and
to the gallant veteran at their head, and it is in the interest of the
North to be told the truth, which the officers of the regular army are
now unhesitatingly telling&#x2014;namely, that it was to that army that the
United States owed the victories in the Mexican War, the volunteers by
no means proving equal to the exigency.  A repetition of the harmless
business at Fort Sumter has taken place, and Secession batteries and
Federal vessels have blazed away at each other for a couple of days in
a manner that calls out all the adjectives of admiration at the
command of the narrators; but the only result has been that one of the
ships was rendered "frightfully leaky."  Several murders on both sides
and some outrages are also among the news, but for these symptoms of
brutality the American people are in no sort responsible, and it is to
be regretted that party scribes seek to palliate deeds which disgust
the nation itself.  The whole internecine drama is one which no
Englishman can witness without a shudder.  The death of Mr. Douglas,
so recently a formidable competitor for the highest honours, is not
now an event of significance, but America has lost a strong man who
seemed to be awakened by the crisis to a sense that there are higher
things than party battles, and who might have done her good service in
the trying times that have yet to come.</p>

our first illustration, was made on the 31st ult.  There was a
considerable body of Secessionists in the village, twenty-seven of
whom were killed.  The Federal calvalry retired with the loss of six
killed and missing.  It having been reported that two of the prisoners
were to be hanged by the Confederates, the United States' cavalry
subsequently made another charge upon the town and released them.  On
the 31st ult. a company of the New York Zouaves was sent to take
possession of an old mill two or three miles from Alexandria, and a
party of Virginia troops lying in ambush fired upon them, killing one
of the Zouaves and wounding another.  The Zouaves returned the fire,
though with probably little, if any, effect, as they could not see the

SINGULAR engine of war has just been completed in the United States.
The determination of the Federal Government to reconstruct the bridges
on the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, destroyed by
a mob from Baltimore, has led to the construction of a
railroad-battery by the Federal Government at the locomotive works of
Baldwin and Co., of Philadelphia.  One of the long platform
baggage-cars has been fixed with sides and top of thick sheet iron,
the sides having portholes and loopholes for musketry.  A turn-table
has been arranged, on which a rifled cannon is to be placed.  The
carriage for the gun is so constructed that it can be fired at any
angle, and from any one of the portholes in the sides and end of the
car.  In place of shot or shell from the cannon, pieces of iron
punched from locomotive boilers will be used as loads.  This car is to
be placed in front of a locomotive, with fifty men inside, armed with
Mini&#x00E9; rifles, and with seamen to work the cannon.</p>

which, it is said, will cast from 100 to 500 balls per minute, has
just been made by Mr. Winans, of Baltimore.  This gun was seized by
Colonel Jones, of the Massachusetts Volunteers, when on its way from
Baltimore to the Secessionist camp at Harper's Ferry, and has since
been used in protecting the viaduct at the Washington Junction on the
Baltimore branch of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  The merits of
the steam-gun are thus summed up by its inventor, Mr. Dickinson:&#x2014;"As
a triumph of inventive genius in the application and practical
demonstration of centrifugal force this most <pb n="576"/>
efficient engine stands without a parallel, commanding wonder and
admiration at the simplicity of its construction and the
destructiveness of its effects, and is eventually destined to
inaugurate a new era in the science of war.  Rendered ballproof, and
protected by an iron cone, and mounted on a four-wheeled carriage, it
can be readily moved from place to place or kept on march with an
army.  It can be constructed to discharge missiles of any capacity,
from an ounce ball to a 24lb. shot, with a force and range equal to
the most approved gunpowder projectiles, and can discharge from 100 to
500 balls per minute.  For city or harbour defence it would prove more
efficient than the largest battery.  For use on the battle-field the
musket-calibre engine would mow down opposing troops as the scythe
mows standing grain; and in sea-fights, mounted on low-decked
steamers, it would be capable of sinking any ordinary war-vessel.  In
addition to the advantages of power, continuous action, and velocity
of discharge, may be added economy in cost of construction, in space,
labour, and transportation, all of which would be small in comparison
to the cost and working of batteries of cannon and the equipment and
management of a proportionate force of infantry."</p>

               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">This</hi> river, the largest and most important of the
eastern affluents of the Mississippi, is formed by the junction of the
Alleghany [sic] and Monongahela Rivers at Pittsburg [sic],
Pennsylvania.  It has thence a west-south-west course of 1033 miles,
separating the States of Virginia and Kentucky on the east and south
from Ohio; Indiana and Illinois north and west, and joins the
Mississippi at Cairo.  At Pittsburg [sic] it is about 830 feet above
the sea.  Near Louisville it passes through a mountain break and forms
rapids, in which it descends twenty-three feet in two miles; but these
are obviated by a canal navigable for steamers.  Its course
thenceforth is mostly through a level country, and its current is
generally placid, being usually from two to three miles an hour.  The
Ohio runs in a valley, inclosed on both sides by ranges of hills,
called River Mountains.  These hills vary considerably in height, but
are generally between 300 and 500 feet.  Their ascent is sometimes
rocky and abrupt, but often sufficiently gradual to admit cultivation
to the summit. The hills diminish in altitude as they approach the
rapids of Louisville, where they rise again to a height nearly equal
to what they attain at the head of the river; and thence they
gradually lower, until they disappear a little above the confluence of
the Ohio and Green Rivers.  At this point a low country commences,
which extends to the mouth of the Ohio, a distance of more than 150
miles.  The river also increases in width and diminishes in velocity.
The low country on its banks is thickly wooded, and its soil is a deep
alluvium.  The hills which bound the alluvial district are at some
distance from the stream.  It principal affluents are the Big-Beaver,
Muskingum, Scioto, Miami, and Wabash from the north; the Kenawha,
Sandy River, Kentucky, Green River, Cumberland, and Tennessee from the
south.  Its basin is estimated to comprise 196,000 square miles, and,
with its tributaries, it presents at least 5000 miles of navigation
through some of the most fertile tracts of country in America.  There
are several towns on its banks.</p>

                  <hi rend="center">AN AMERICAN STATESMAN.</hi>
               </p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> history of a nation
may be read in the lives of its statesmen.  While the leader of the
Italian liberals was drawing his last breath in Turin, the body of the
Coryphaeus of the American Democrats of the North was lying in state
in Chicago.  Mr. Douglas died on the 3rd, Count Cavour on the 6th,
instant.  Both died prematurely, the one having just completed his
forty-eighth, the other his fifty-first, year.  Both died from
over-exertion, though to the Italian the effects of that over-exertion
were rendered fatal by too sedentary habits and ignorant doctors,
while in the case of the American a fatal tendency to indulgence aided
in ruining a physical constitution of uncommon vigour and powers of
endurance.  A useful moral can be drawn from the career of each.
Count Cavour, by subordinating his energies to great ideas, lived long
enough to see Piedmont merged into Italy and the darling objects of
his life all but accomplished.  The Illinois senator, by making his
whole political career subserve the idea of self-aggrandisement at any
sacrifice of principle and consistency, did more than any other man to
bring upon his country the dire calamity of that civil war on the
opening scenes of which his eyes closed.  The name of Cavour will
occupy a bright page in the history of this century; the reputation of
Douglas will survive in the annuls of the United States only as a
memorial of a debased epoch of their political life.  It is scarcely
fair to America to push the contrast between these two eminent
publicists further, for Cavour was the consummate flower of European
statesmanship, while Douglas was only the highest type of a low but
not the less influential order of American politicians.  The best
class of American statesmen in active life, those who represent the
more cultivated classes of their countrymen, are not to be found in
the ranks of the Democratic party, nor in fellowship with Mr. Douglas.
 Seward and Sumner, Chase and Banks, Hall, Everett, and Winthrop, are
all scholarly, "bookish" men, eager students of European history and
literature, claiming a strong affinity with the intellectual movement,
and respecting the public opinion of the leading nations of Western
and Central Europe.  Stephen Arnold Douglas was not a man of this
stamp.  He had no taste for literary studies.  He was purely American,
un-European, racy of the soil, a representative man of the masses of
his countrymen.  His thorough personal identity with the people was
the chief source of his strength, and he knew it.  To have undergone
the laborious operation of refining his tastes and habits, and of
cultivating the fine natural powers of his mind, would only have
broken that identity and weakened that influence.  Why should he not
remain as he was&#x2014;a powerful and ready debater, a subtle and
resourceful dialectician, a success demagogue, the greatest stump
orator of the age?  By inspecting the career of such a man, who aimed
to be and was a faithful reflex of the popular as distinguished from
the cultivated American mind, we are able to gain a much truer insight
into the favourite prejudices and ambitions of the Northern masses
than if we examined the life and speeches of Webster, Calhoun, or
Seward.</p>
               <p>The history of Mr. Douglas's advancement is a wonderful
example of the rapid elevation of a clever young politician from the
lowest ranks to the highest office, save the Presidency, which his
party could bestow.  At the age of twenty he emigrated from Western
New York to Illinois, and began life as an apprentice to a
cabinet-maker.  He then became a school-teacher and a law-student.
Almost immediately after receiving his diploma, and before he reached
the age of twenty-two, he was elected to the office of
Attorney-General of the State!  This manufacturing of an
Attorney-General out of a law-student in the short space of eighteen
months is a brilliant achievement, hardly possible under a tamer
r&#x00E9;gime than that of manhood suffrage.  After this, and while yet under
the age of thirty, he became successively Secretary of State and Judge
of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois.  In 1843 he was elected
to the lower branch of Congress, and twice re-elected.  In 1847, when
but thirty-five, the earliest eligible age, he was raised by the
Illinois Legislature to the highest office in their gift&#x2014;a seat in the
Senate of the United States&#x2014;which he retained, after two re-elections,
until his death.  In Europe clever young demagogues do not become
Attorney-Generals at</p>

               <p>twenty-two, Supreme Judges at twenty-eight, and grave and
reverend senators at thirty-five.  No wonder young America looked up
to him as their natural leader.  Higher, however, he was not destined
to rise.  In the nominating Convention of the Democratic party in 1852
Mr. Pierce was selected before him as their candidate for the
presidency.  In 1856 the cautious men of that party preferred Mr.
Buchanan to the author of the Acts which repealed the Missouri
Compromise; but Mr. Douglas was their second choice.  In 1860 he
obtained the nomination at last; but the extreme Southern party,
offended at his acts of contumacy in the two preceding years, seceded
from the Convention and nominated Mr. Breckinridge.  Mr. Douglas
occupied middle ground between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Breckinridge,
between the anti and pro slavery candidates; but that middle ground
was also occupied by Mr. Bell.  Yet, notwithstanding these enormous
disadvantages, his hold on the masses of his countrymen was so strong
that he polled more than a million and a quarter votes, and within six
hundred thousand of the votes given for Mr. Lincoln.</p>
               <p>We have said that
no one man has done more than Mr. Douglas to precipitate his country
into civil war.  He has done this, as a Northerner, by ministering to
the worst passions of the slaveowners, by intoxicating them with a
delusive sense of power and distempered visions of empire.  There have
always been two parties in the South-the moderate, self-restraining
portion, headed by such politicians as Clay, Crittenden, and Bell, and
the extreme self-indulging party.  Mr. Douglas, though a Northern man,
did his best until 1858 to aggrandise the latter and overwhelm the
former.  He has been but too successful.  He was an ardent advocate of
the immediate annexation of Texas, of the war with Mexico, of the
acquisition of Cuba (whether by purchase or war), and of the
filibustering expeditions of Walker in Central America.  All these
measures were recommended to the extreme Southern party as calculated
to extend the area of slavery, and for the same reason deprecated by
the moderate Southerners.  But his most fatal act was the
introduction, in 1854, of the measure for the repeal of the Missouri
Compromise, whereby the slaveowners were allowed to carry their slaves
into the territories of Nebraska and Kansas.  For this measure he, as
its father and as chairman of the Senate's Committee on Territories,
is personally responsible.  It was the last tempting cup he pressed to
the lips of the already inflamed and giddy Southerners.
               <q><lg type="couplet">
                  <l>Hac fonte derivata clades,</l>
                  <l>In populum patriamque fluxit.</l>
               </lg></q>
               But for the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise the secession of the Southern States would at
least have been delayed for many years.  The immediate effects of it
on the party politics of the United States were two&#x2014;namely, the
extinction of the moderate party in the South, and the rise of a party
in the North pledged to overthrow the ascendancy of Southern
politicians and principles in the Government of the Union.  The
collision between the two sectional parties which Mr. Douglas's policy
created brought about the Southern secession and the civil war which
thereon ensued.  Mr. Douglas lived just long enough to witness the
evil fruit of his self-seeking schemes, and in the eyes of his
Northern fellow-citizens to atone for all his errors, by raising his
latest breath in favour of a war for chastising those very Southerners
to whose demoralisation he himself had contributed.</p>
               <p>His admirers may
also urge in his defence that since 1858 he withstood the Pro-Slavery
extremists.  He who had no words but those of contumely for the
Free-State majority in Kansas in 1855, '56, and '57, when shot down
and trampled upon by Missouri "Border ruffians" and Federal
soldiers&#x2014;he who looked on with his hands in his pockets while Preston
Brooks was seeking the life of Charles Sumner in the Senate Chamber
itself&#x2014;contended for the rights of the majority in 1858.  Here again
self-interest affords the clue to his conduct.  In that year Mr.
Douglas's seat in the Senate was in danger.  The agitation which the
repeal of the Missouri Compromise had called forth had had its effect
on the people of Illinois as of every other Northern State.  Mr.
Lincoln, a man of the people like Mr. Douglas, an equally able
dialectician, and distinguished for those high moral qualities in
which Mr. Douglas was so deficient, was put forward by the Republicans
of Illinois as the representative of the anti-slavery sentiment.  Mr.
Douglas found that if he came before the people of Illinois in his old
character, as an unmitigated champion of slavery extension, he would
infallibly be beaten by Mr. Lincoln, lose his seat in the Senate, his
position in his State, and, consequently, his prospects of being Mr.
Buchanan's successor.  The first thing needful was to retain his seat
in the Senate.  That secured, he would again bid for the suffrages of
the South.  Thus, in 1858, he found it his interest to take up middle
ground, to profess entire indifference to the extension or
non-extension of slavery, and to argue in favour of the right of the
majority of the settlers to determine this question as they pleased.
On this platform, and by accusing Mr. Lincoln of advocating the
"monstrous idea" of "nigger equality" with the white man, Mr. Douglas
was able to win a fraudulent victory over his opponent.  The triumph
was not fairly won, because Mr. Douglas's friends in the State
Legislature had refused to repartition the electoral districts of the
State according to the returns of the latest Census, as they were
bound by the State Constitution to do, and thus Mr. Douglas, who was
defeated on the aggregate vote, was able to obtain a majority in the
Electoral College.  Returned a third time to the Senate, Mr. Douglas,
finding that all overtures for reconciliation with the Southern
leaders were contemptuously rejected, continued to uphold the doctrine
of "popular sovereignty," or the right of the majority, and in so
doing confirmed the liberties of the people of Kansas against which he
had formerly conspired.  But the pro-Slavery champions, in humouring
whose extravagant pretensions the best years of his life had been
spent, did not forgive him for this eleventh-hour desertion of their
cause.  They resolved he should not be Mr. Buchanan's successor, and
threw the game into the hands of Mr. Douglas's old antagonist, Abraham
Lincoln.  Vain were Mr. Douglas's almost superhuman efforts to stem
the tide of his destiny.  Vain was that unparalleled display of
egotistic stump-oratory by which during the hot summer and early
autumn months of last year he actually made a personal canvass of the
whole constituency of the Union from Maine to Louisiana.  He lived to
witness his rival's triumph, and even to hold his rival's hat during
the delivery of the Inaugural Address from the steps of the Capitol.
The over-exertion and exposure which his first and second contests
with Mr. Lincoln necessitated, and the excitement of a simultaneous
struggle with the Southern politicians, determined to rule or ruin,
brought on a series of attacks which wrecked a constitution naturally
very strong, and which, moreover, his bar-room tastes had long helped
to undermine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Douglas's forte lay in expressing cogently and
intensely the dominant prejudices of the coarser portion of the
Northerners.  Their love of territorial aggrandisement at any price,
of war and liquor, their hatred of England and the negro race, found
in him an energetic exponent.  In the debate in 1845 on the Oregon
Boundary question Mr. Douglas gained great popularity by a "fifty-four
forty or fight"* speech, of the tenor of which one sentence will give
a fair idea:&#x2014;"If, to maintain our just rights, we must have war, let
us be prepared to drive Great Britain, with the last vestiges of Royal
authority, from the continent of North America, and make the United
States an ocean-bound republic."</p>
               <p>In the international embroglio [sic]
which arose out of the construction put upon the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty
by the democratic politicians Mr. Douglas was equally passionate and
uncompromising.  Moloch-like, his voice was ever the loudest for open
war with Britain or Spain.  If, of late years, the American people
have abandoned much of their old bitterness of feeling towards us&#x2014;a
bitterness, however, which is just now enjoying the honour of a
revival&#x2014;this happy change of sentiment has been effected in spite of
the appeals of Mr. Douglas and his followers.  That Mr. Douglas's hot
ambition to fill the chair once occupied by Washington was doomed to
disappointment is no loss to the cause of civilisation.  It redounds
to the credit of the Americans of the North that in the late memorable
Presidential contest in every Northern State, except New Jersey, the
arbitrament of manhood suffrage, usually so perilous to the better
cause, was in favour of Abraham Lincoln and against Stephen Arnold
Douglas.</p>
               <p>*The Democratic party claimed that the United States'
territory extended to 54&#x00B0; 40' N. lat.  Hence the watchword "fifty-four
forty or fight" became popular until the question was peaceably
settled.</p>

privateer, off Georgetown, of a Main brig, valued at 40,000 dollars.</p>
               <p>On land the chief events are two&#x2014;the evacuation of Harper's Ferry by
the Confederates, and the check received by the Federals in an attack
on a Confederate battery at Great Bethel, a country village on the
road leading from Hampton to Yorktown, about midway between James and
York Rivers.  The former movement was rendered necessary by the
approach of the Federals from the east, north, and west.  All the
Government property was destroyed before the evacuation.  The
Confederates have now abandoned the line of the Potomac, and
concentrated their troops for the defence of Richmond and the line of
the James River.  Their most advanced position is their intrenched
camp at Manassas Gap Junction.</p>
               <p>The attack on the battery at Great
Bethel was made on the 10th inst.  It was intended to be a nocturnal
surprise, but Colonel Bendix's German regiment misunderstood the
signal and fired in the dark on the Albany regiment, which returned
the compliment.  This accident, besides causing several casualties,
aroused the Confederates.  After two hours' fighting the Federals
retired.  The most authentic report of their loss places it at 19
killed, 47 wounded, and 5 missing.  Among the former are a Major and a
Lieutenant of the Regulars.  General Pierce was much censured for
losing "his presence of mind" during the action.</p>
               <p>The march of General
M'Lellan in command of the loyal Virginian, Ohio, and Indiana, troops
through Western Virginia has been uninterrupted.  He has crossed the
Alleghanies [sic] and the Blue Ridge, and has made Cumberland, the
chief town of Western Maryland, his head-quarters.  In Western
Virginia the Stars and Stripes are everywhere in the ascendant.</p>
               <p>General Prentiss, in command of the Federal forces at Cairo, Illinois,
having heard that the Kentucky Militia had established a camp at a
point in Kentucky, ten miles south of Cairo, sent ten companies to
dislodge them, which they effected, the Kentuckians fleeing.</p>

               <p>The seat of Government has been removed from
Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond, Virginia.  President Davis daily
reviews the troops.</p>
               <p>In Tennessee the vote on the Secession ordinance
was taken on the 8th inst.  In Western and Central Tennessee the vote
was nearly unanimous for Secession, but in Eastern Tennessee (the
highland region) 10,000 votes were cast in favour of the Union.</p>
               <p>Upwards of 700 slaves have escaped from Virginia during the past two
weeks, and are now held by the Federal forces as contraband of war.</p>
               <p>The New Orleans journals continue to be received in St. Louis,
notwithstanding the stoppage of the mails.  All the reports from the
South concur in representing the crops of wheat, maize, and cotton as
unusually promising.</p>

               <p>The Maryland Legislature has
instructed the senators to Congress from that State to vote for the
recognition of the Southern Confederacy.  General Banks, of
Massachusetts, has superseded General Cadwallader in command at
Baltimore.</p>
               <p>The Governor of Kentucky has protested against the action
of the Federal troops in invading that State, as mentioned above.  The
United States' collector at Louisville reports that the passage of
provisions southward from that place has been stopped, but that the
trade is still going on from Bardstown and Bowling Green, in the
southern part of the State.</p>
               <p>On the 11th Governor Jackson, of Missouri,
demanded of General Lyon the disbanding and withdrawal of the Federal
forces in Missouri, which being done, the State militia was to be
disbanded.  General Lyon refused.  The Governor then issued a
proclamation calling for 50,000 State troops to resist Federal
usurpation.  The State officers have abandoned the capital, Jefferson
City, and are concentrating their forces at Arrow Rock, a point fifty
miles north-west of Jefferson City.   General Lyon is in pursuit of
them, and a serious conflict seems imminent.  There has been another
collision between the Federal volunteers and the people in St. Louis.</p>
               <p>In Western Virginia the Convention at Wheeling have unanimously
resolved to form a Provisional Government, declare the State offices
vacant, and elect Union members of Congress.  They have passed
resolutions thanking General M'Lellan for sending troops to the
assistance of the Western Virginians.</p>
               <p>The Secretary of War has issued
a notice ordering the employment of female instead of male nurses in
the military hospitals.</p>
               <p>The examination of the seized telegrams at
Washington reveals the fact that James K. Harvey, the newly-appointed
Minister to Portugal, and supposed to be a zealous Republican, had
sent to Charleston the first intelligence of the intended naval
expedition for the relief of Fort Sumter.  Mr. Harvey has been
recalled.</p>

               <p>The Board of Underwriters, New York,
have advanced the rates of war policies on American ships to seven per
cent, making a discrimination in favour of foreign nations of five per
cent.  The effect of this will be to throw American bottoms out of the
market.</p>
               <p>Massachusetts has accepted 190 companies, all containing 101
men each.</p>
               <p>The western grain crops are doing well, but not so much has
been planted this year as last, owing to the diversion of agricultural
labour to the war.  All branches of trade in the Atlantic cities,
except the export-trade and those connected with the supply of war
materiel, are suffering extremely, and the merchants are on the eve of
bankruptcy.  There is no diminution in the enthusiasm for the war and
the absurd ill-feeling towards England.</p>

               <p>Three
Sketches by our Special Artist in connection with the war doings in
America are engraved in the present Number.  On page 602 is depicted a
characteristic group of "Wilson's Boys" encamped at Staten Island.
"This corps," he writes, "might properly be styled the 'Chevalier
Guard,' being composed principally of the chevaliers d'industrie of
New York: they have no regular uniform yet, though I do not know but
what their present costume is the most picturesque.  The other day
when their Colonel dismissed them from parade he took out his watch,
and, looking at it, said suggestively to his men, 'This is the kind of
watch they have in Baltimore boys.'  This announcement was hailed by
enthusiastic cheering."  On the same page we have a representation of
"Our Artist's Head-quarters in the Camp of the 2nd New York Regiment,"
situated on the high grounds near Washington.  An Engraving of "Our
Artist's Kitchen" in the same camp, which appears on the first page,
shows, we are happy to see, that he is able, amid the fears and
anxieties consequent on a campaigning life, to attend in some degree
to his creature comforts.  The Union forces occupying positions near
Washington have been estimated at 60,000.  Scott has from 15,000 to
20,000 men across the river, opposite Washington, posted between
Alexandria and Arlington Heights.<pb n="602"/>
