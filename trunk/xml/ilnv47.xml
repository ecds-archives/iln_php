<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL
INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The blockade of all United States ports, including Galveston, has
been raised, and they are now open to foreign commerce.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has announced that, in consequence of England not
absolutely withdrawing the twenty-four hours' rule, the Federal
vessels will not pay the customary courtesies to vessels of the
British Navy. The Federal Government also refuses to recognise any
transfer of rebel cruisers, and claims the right to capture them under
whatever flag they may be placed.</p>
<p>President Johnson has appointed Andrew Hamilton of Texas, James
Johnson of Georgia, and Louis E. Parsons of Alabama, provisional
Governors of those States, in accordance with the programme adopted in
North Carolina and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Immense numbers of negroes, past work, have been expelled from the
cities of Georgia. Great mortality prevails among the negroes in
Charleston.</p>
<p>Provisional Governor Holden, of North Carolina, has issued a
proclamation calling for a Convention to amend the State Constitution,
to elect a Governor and Legislature, and to restore the complete rule
of civil law in that State. The Governor exhorts the people to become
loyal, good, and useful citizens. He officially announces to the
coloured people their freedom, and hopes they will become industrious,
as otherwise their race cannot escape extinction. He promises to be
their friend if they do right, but declares that he will aid in
inflicting prompt punishment upon the idle and vicious.</p>
<p>The message of the Governor to the Virginia Legislature urges the
avoidance of all legislation calculated unnecessarily to irritate the
people. He recommends fewer restrictions in the regulation of the
white elective franchise. As neither himself nor the Legislature has
the control of the negro suffrage, they will not deliberate on that
question. An extra Session of the Virginia Legislature was convened on
the 19th ult. at Richmond.</p>
<p>The Governor of Tennessee has ordered the election of a full
Congressional delegation.</p>
<p>Orders have been issued to dismantle the defensive works around
Washington, except twenty-two forts and three batteries, which will be
strengthened and permanently garrisoned.</p>
<p>The Government had ordered a further reduction of the army by
50,000 men.</p>
<p>The 25 per cent restriction duty on cotton west of the Mississippi
had been removed.</p>
<p>The country is now divided into five grand military divisions--the
Atlantic, under General Meade; the Mississippi, under Sherman; the
Tennessee, under General Thomas; the South-west, under General
Sheridan; and the Pacific, under General Halleck.</p>
<p>The grand jury of San Francisco has dismissed the complaint against
the parties charged with organising an expedition to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Breckenridge and six others reached Cuba, on the 11th ult.,
from the Florida coast. They crossed in an open boat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln has taken up her residence, for the summer, at Hyde
Park, six miles from Chicago.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seward, wife of Secretary Seward, has died of bilious fever,
at Washington.</p>
<p>A delegation of Poles has had an interview with President
Johnson. They say that 20,000 expatriated Poles desire to emigrate to
America. Efforts are being made to get them to settle in Virginia.</p>
<p>The reading of the argument for the defence, in the conspiracy
trials, was continued before the military court in Washington on the
21st ult. Mr. Doster, counsel for Payne and Atzerott, admitted the
guilt of Payne, but urged the Court to consider how far his punishment
should be mitigated on account of his manifest conviction that he was
doing right in attempting to kill Mr. Seward. Payne had, by reason of
his Southern education, his participation at a tender age in war, and
by his residence in districts wherein the Federal troops had caused
great devastation and suffering, become a deadly enemy to the
North. He had erroneously regarded Mr. Lincoln as a tyrant and
usurper, and Mr. Seward as a mortal enemy to the South and her
institutions, and he therefore believed himself right in attempting
his life. The accused was, in his guilt, only a consequence of the
evil teachings of slaveholders, and was no hired tool, but a fanatic,
an enthusiast, and a hero. Apart from his crime, which he (Mr. Doster)
abhorred, he saw much in Payne's character to admire. Mr. Doster
strongly urged the Court to consider the extenuating circumstances of
the case before pronouncing sentence, although the prisoner desired to
die, in the fanatical belief that, by suffering execution, he would
gain a crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In behalf of Atzerott, Mr. Doster claimed that the prisoner had,
although at first he considered Booth's propositions, finally shrank
from participation in their execution, merely maintaining an
appearance of co-operation therein to escape Booth's indignation.</p>
<p>An additional argument was read by Mr. Aiken in behalf of
Mrs. Surratt, and the Court adjourned. In consequence of her serious
illness, Mrs. Surratt has been removed from her cell to more
comfortable quarters in the penitentiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson has submitted an argument denying the
jurisdiction of the military court for the conspiracy
trial.</p></div2>

<p>Havannah advices announce the arrival of General John
C. Breckenridge in Cuba, after an adventurous voyage, in company with
six other persons, in an open boat, from the coast of Florida. The
persons accompanying General Breckenridge were Colonel Wilson, an aid
to Jefferson Davis, Captain Taylor Hood, formerly commander of the
Tallahassee; Corporal Russell, two Confederate private soldiers, and a
slave of Breckenridge's who refused to leave his master. General
Breckenridge and Colonel Wilson were within forty miles of Mr. Davis
when he was captured, and Captain Hood was actually with him, but
succeeded in making his escape, and on the following day joined
General Breckenridge, and the party at once started rapidly towards
the coast. Crossing Georgia into Florida they descended the St. John's
River in a boat to Jupiter's Inlet, where they met a party of Federal
deserters, from whom they secured a better boat, which they hauled
across the country to an inlet of the sea. After performing Divine
worship the little party launched their boat. They had a narrow escape
from capture on the first day of their voyage. They had beached their
boat on a sand-reef, some sixty miles from their point of departure,
in order to hunt shellfish, which, with Indian corn, constituted their
sole food on the voyage. A Federal steam-transport came in sight, and
a boat put off towards the reef. Captain Hood and the two privates met
the boat, some distance from the reef, and succeeded in convincing the
officer in charge that the party consisted of paroled soldiers, who
were looking down the coast for old wrecks, and they were left
unmolested. After a voyage of three, or, according to some accounts,
eight days, involving great exposure and privation, they reached
Cardenas, on June 11. They were very kindly received by the people,
and the authorities furnished them transportation to Havannah. Colonel
Helm, formerly United States Consul at Havannah, presented
Breckenridge to the Captain-General of the island, who received him
with cordial hospitality and great courtesy, and is said to have
assured him of a safe asylum in the island.</p></div2>

<p>On the 16th of June a stone monument, 27 ft. high, was erected,
with due ceremonial, on a crest a little south of Henry-house, "in
memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July 21, 1861." The spot
selected is where Heintzelman's division made their hardest fight, but
were finally driven back by Kirby Smith. A considerable force of
troops was on the ground, and a large company of civilians; proper
religious exercises were gone through, some addresses delivered, and
then a salute was fired by Captain Smith's Massachusetts battery on
the same spot where Rickett's battery was captured. The battle-field
itself presents few evidences of the engagement. Here and there a
mound indicates a grave, but they are not numerous; and the only relic
found was an old musket barrel.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE</hi><lb/>ISLAND OF
SOMBRERO.</p>
<p>[The island of Sombrero is] one of the
Leeward Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, containing the richest natural
deposit of phosphate of lime at present known. The island was first
visited by an English gentleman about the year 1814, and again by him
in 1825, on which latter occasion a report was made to the British
Government, but did not meet with that consideration which subsequent
events prove it to have deserved. In 1856 the Americans took
possession of the island, and in the course of a very short time
exported to the extent of 100,000 tons of this valuable fertiliser, to
resuscitate the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Subsequently
their proceedings attracted the attention of a British surveying
expedition, at that time engaged in the West Indies, as may be learned
from a communication to the Royal Agricultural Society<pb n="18"/> of
England, by Sir Roderick Murchison, who, in describing the geological
structure of the island, says:--"I have often regretted that I have
never had it in my power to communicate anything of importance to the
British farmer; I am now, however, enabled to make an announcement
which will, I have no doubt, be as acceptable to agriculturalists as
it is likely to become very valuable to the merchant and shipowner."
It appears that the Americans have already quarried away a
considerable part of the island, and sold the substance in New
York. This transaction led to an official correspondence between the
British and American Governments, and eventually the right of the
British Crown to the possession of this valuable deposit was
acknowledged by the United States Government. Sir Roderick Murchison
considers our holding the Island of Sombrero to be of great national
importance, in providing our agriculturists, from a British
possession, with a plentiful supply of a good substitute for the guano
of Peru.</p></div2>

<p>...On Monday the new actor from America appeared at the New
Adelphi, in an American play and an American character. Mr. Owens
then, for the first time, presented himself before the British public,
and produced a new drama, entitled "Solon Shingle." The hero is an
American farmer who, in paying a visit to an American village, makes
himself at home wherever he is, and practises a familiarity so free
and easy that he scarcely recognises any distinction between <hi
rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuum.</hi> The
nonchalance and provincialism of the character are very striking and
novel; the make-up is admirable. The old man toddles about, and
interferes in every thing, intruding himself into a merchant's store
at a late hour in the evening, and even into the Court of Justice,
standing up as a witness in a cause with which he had nothing to
do. In these different situations he spins a variety of yarns, in
which the most is made of nothing, the peculiarities of character
being brought out by minute details, which have no importance but as
they illustrate an individuality. Altogether, this is a remarkable
performance, and may make a sensation....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A "Shoddy" Millionaire At New York</hi>.--One
day, when Tommy was "doing" New York, he strode into Tiffany's
magnificent jewellery establishment, on Broadway, and startled the
assembled salesmen with a loud "Show us a diamond!" "Here is one, Sir,"
responded an elegantly modulated voice from the "diamond department."
"Eighty dollars, Sir." "Pooh! not such a speck as that; something
bigger." "Allow me to show you this; very pure stone, Sir, 160 dols."
"Nonsense, bigger!" Herewith the gentlemanly salesman (who I have
always suspected to be a noble Lord in difficulties) produced the
brilliant of about the size of a small pea. "Exquisite stone, Sir;
first water, 800." "Look here!" cried Tommy, becoming exasperated, "If
you've got a reg'lar diamond, fetch it out; if you haven't, just say
so." My Lord, half amused, half vexed, here, by way of totally
annihilating his rough customer, brought out the Koh-i-noor of the
place. "Will this suit you, Sir? Moderately fine stone; price, 15,000
dols." "Now you're coming to it!" cried Tommy, decidedly
mollified. "Is this the tip-top biggest?" "It is, Sir," replied his
Lordship, coolly (stroking his beard at the same time, as if to say,
"Now, my rustic friend, I have wasted quite time enough upon you, you
may go.") "You ain't got nothin' bigger, now?" "Nothing, I assure
you." "Then I'll take it." M'Lord, I grieve to say, lost his presence
of mind, and stared; but Thomas at once produced a huge roll of
"greenbacks," counted out the money, and the sale was concluded. This,
as I have been told, occurred more than a year ago. Now, my Lord,
having become somewhat familiar with the ways and means of Shoddy,
would scarcely lift his eyelids were his coalheaver to propose to buy
out the entire concern.--<hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> for

few whalers and United States men-of-war had touched there at long
intervals, and an occasional merchant vessel had taken aboard a cargo of
hides and tallow. The interior was a <hi rend="italic">terra
incognita</hi> to all except its simple natives and the few travellers
and emigrants who had partly explored it. In one year after the
discovery of gold had become universally known San Francisco had a
population of about 30,000, and its harbour was filled with ships from
every quarter of the world. Ten years later its population had more
than doubled; and five years later it had nearly doubled again, being
hard on to 120,000.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RECONSTRUCTION, BRITISH AND<lb/>AMERICAN.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A great</hi> work of political reconstruction
is in mid progress in the United Kingdom. We are not, indeed,
refashioning our Constitution. The three estates of the realm, their
proper sphere and limits of action, their mutual duties and
responsibilities, remain what they have been, and are unchallenged by
public opinion. We are meddling with none of our great national
institutions. We are shifting nothing of importance from its ancient
basis. Nevertheless, we have been engaged throughout the week now
closing, and we shall be more or less generally engaged for the next
fortnight, in building up again that part of the machinery of
government which, because it bears the chief stress of legislation and
has a predominant influence on its character and results, is wisely
submitted to periodical renovation with a view to adapt it to such
change as may have passed upon the public mind. The Crown, acting in
conformity with law, has dissolved one House of Commons, and the
country is busy in putting together another. Strictly speaking, the
work is one of reconstruction, but reconstruction in an extremely
limited sense.</p>
<p>In the very thick of the turmoil inevitably occasioned by a general
election there is ground for satisfaction in the knowledge that the
process is attended with no danger. The legislative mechanism which on
Monday morning last was nonexistent, and which even yet is but half
refitted, will be framed on the same model, with two or three trifling
exceptions, as that which has served the use of the present
generation. Such alterations as are now being made will affect merely
the materials of which it is composed. The leading wheels and
principal levers in the machine will, for the most part, be replaced
from the old one. They will, no doubt, be cleansed of some of the
deposit which during six years' work has accumulated about them, and
which had helped somewhat to clog their movements. Friction against
the great outside public will, perhaps, rub away some soil and rust,
and fit them for accelerated action. But no great change is desired or
will be effected as regards them. In conjunction, however, with these
more important parts, there are a considerable number and variety of
minor pieces, all having something to do towards the general result,
and each susceptible, in doing it, of improvement or decay. It is here
that the chief alterations are to be expected. Old and untrustworthy
appliances, or, what in effect amounts to the same thing, those which
are thought to be such, will be cast aside for new and more promising
material. That which is suffered to remain will in many cases be
passed through the fire, hammered into more convenient forms, polished
and lubricated, and refitted to its former place. There will be a
deal of scouring and cleaning, the substitution of not a little that
is untried for that which after trial is found wanting, and, it is to
be hoped, a general improvement of the machinery in regard to the
parts of which it is composed; but that will be the whole amount of
positive change accomplished or sought. There is nothing in all this
calculated to unsettle public confidence, nothing to excite misgivings
as to the future, no empiricism of which the most timid need to be
afraid.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not mean to imply that change even to this extent
may not or will not involve some change in the action of
Parliament. We shall not assume to judge what may be the character of
the future House of Commons, or what will be the drift of its
policy. Only events will bring either the one or the other fully into
light. But we do regard it as matter of satisfaction that, on the
whole, the process which is being now resorted to will tend rather to
abridge than to widen the distance between the legislatorial power and
the settled convictions<pb n="30"/> and will of the country. Whatever
these latter may prove to be, after the criticism, the siftings, and
the verdict of a general election, they may be embodied in law without
imperilling anything which commends itself to sound sense and just
feeling, and almost as certainly without producing so much as a jar
upon the nervous system of the community. We may anticipate just so
much expansion in the aims and proceedings of the Government as will
be rendered necessary by any expansion which has taken place in the
thoughts and wishes of the public. That is all; and that is an issue
to which every intelligent and well-trained mind will be content to
submit. So that, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
reconstruction is but a renovation of means and apparatus, with growth
as the result. The process is far from unimportant. Upon those who
conduct it rests a grave responsibility, but, at least, it is
unaccompanied by serious apprehensions for the future.</p>
<p>Our kinsmen on the other side of the Atlantic are also intent just
now upon the business of reconstruction--but under what different
circumstances and on how much wider a scale! Let it not be supposed
that we allude to the contrast for the sake of self-glorification--we
do so merely, with a view to deepen our own sense of
thankfulness. That they have to face and master, as we can hardly
doubt they will do, a much more searching and difficult problem than
ourselves, cannot be attributed to the superiority of our
qualifications, or of our mode of using them, in any respect. Our good
fortune is, that we long since passed through that stage of national
discipline which they have but just reached, and our hope is that they
will get through it without more permanent suffering than we. Still,
as a simple matter of fact, the processes which are at this moment
operative in the two countries differ so widely the one from the other
in depth, intensity, and duration, that one cannot help viewing then
side by side. The reconstructive work now absorbing the energies of
American statesmanship is not only difficult, but it touches close
upon several dangerous issues. Whereas, in our own case, the past, and
especially the proximate past, is our mainstay, it is in theirs the
source of disquietude. They have to reconstitute the South, not merely
of new materials, bu after a new model. They have to lay again the
very foundations of society. The civil war has broken up the
pre-existing social system, and has pretty well levelled to the dust
the political edifice. It would seem impracticable to reconstruct the
latter in conformity with the provisions of law, and, happily, as we
think, impossible, as well as impolitic, to base society on the
maintenance or rather the restoration of slavery. The consequence is
an immense amount of present confusion, collision, and misery--the
inevitable <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;bris</hi> of an armed conflict
on so gigantic a scale. Some time will be required before the dust and
smoke have sufficiently cleared away to allow of a definite plan being
adopted and brought into operation. Much suffering will, doubtless, be
endured meanwhile; but our Transatlantic cousins are not deficient in
a talent for organisation. We believe they will work out the questions
before them in much less time, and much more satisfactorily, than has
been generally expected, and that the social difficulty will, after
its first pressure, yield to the appliances which robust common-sense
will bring to bear upon it.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two countries at the present moment
suggests matter for profitable consideration. A theory has been
advanced by some, that no great nation can fully develop its
capabilities until it has passed through the ordeal of a civil war,
and that, in the course of its history, one such convulsive intestine
struggle is inevitable. We shall not discuss this theory, neither can
we assent to it. It may be true of certain stages of civilisation, but
we question whether it can be predicated as a law applicable to
nations which are, or will hereafter be, the growth of offshoots from
a population already educated and trained in the principles and
practice of self-government. Be this, however, as it may, every fresh
instance presented to us by history of the attainment of political and
social results by violent means makes us doubt whether the process be
not more costly than the end will repay, and whether the mischief done
by it be not so great that the time, the anxiety, the exertion, and
the self-sacrifice required for the work of reparation might not have
sufficed, if employed in conformity with law, to accomplish, within a
given period, all that may have been achieved by the sword, and
without anything like the attendant suffering. The upward and onward
destinies of a people are seldom, if ever, permanently hastened by
force. They are the result of moral culture, and in very few and
exceptional instances is moral culture quickened by the destruction of
property or the effusion of blood. The reconstruction rendered
necessary by mortal conflicts is always difficult, often
disappointing, and sometimes slower in arriving at its
consummation--namely, the settlement of the vital question in
dispute--than the patient use of milder methods would have been. We
may well be thankful that the business on which our fellow-countrymen
are now engaged is one which less than a month will be required to
effect, and which, when effected, will place the country a step in
advance; and we may sincerely sympathise with our American cousins
that their work does not more closely resemble ours in the ease and
certainty with which it may be dispatched. To bind up and heal deep
wounds is a serious affair--to wash and be refreshed is but a trifling
demand on exertion. Such, however, is the difference between what they
and we are engaged in doing at the present time.</p></div2>

<p>Telegrams from New York, to the 1st inst., state that the
conspiracy trial in Washington has been concluded. The Military
Commission has agreed upon the verdict, but it will not be made public
until after it has been either approved or rejected by the
President. The Judge-Advocate previously submitted an argument
asserting that four of the prisoners were fellow-conspirators with
Booth. He contended that the evidence showed that Davis, Sanders,
Tucker, and others, planned and assisted the assassination.</p>

pardoned by the President, and has commenced practising law at
Culpepper, Virginia.</p>
<p>A deputation from South Carolina has had an interview with
President Johnson to request the appointment of a civil
governor. Johnson replied that no State would go out of the Union. He
must deal with restoration, not reconstruction. The people of South
Carolina could not be admitted to Congressional representation until
they called a convention and adopted the Federal and State
Constitutional Amendment abolishing slavery. He thought if negro
suffrage were now granted employers would control negro suffrage to
the detriment of the poor whites. He would, after consultation with
his Cabinet, consider the appointment of a governor.</p>

<p>There have been serious affrays between the Federal soldiers and
the blacks at several places. At Norfolk the troops, aided by the
white inhabitants, had driven the negroes from the town. At Charleston
there had been a fight between the white and black soldiers, and
several were wounded on each side, At Savannah a New York regiment had
mutinied, and refused to do duty with the black troops; and forty-three of

<p rend="center">THE MONUMENTS ON THE BATTLE-FIELD<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Of Bull Run.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> battles--that of July 21, 1861, and
that of Aug. 29, 1862--were fought between the Confederates and
Federals in the plain traversed by the small river called Bull Run,
which crosses the main road from Washington to Richmond, a few miles
north of Manassas Gap. The scene of the first conflict, one of the
earliest of the war in Virginia, would now scarcely be recognised as a
battle-field. Four years have obliterated nearly all the marks of the
struggle, and the relic-hunter only now and then finds in the grass a
memento of the event. Very few shot and shell remain upon the surface;
the trees are hiding the blotches on their trunks made by bullets, and
the only bones that are found, with few exceptions, are those of
horses, which visitors have not thought of sufficient importance to be
carried away. Some of the fences have been rebuilt, and corn is
planted in many places; while the rapidly-growing bushes hide nearly
all the original features of the field. The battle-field of Groveton,
two miles beyond, towards Warrenton, is more distinctly marked with
traces of battle. Here the shot and shell are thickly strewn, the
trees are splintered, and in many places the forest looks as if it had
been visited by smallpox. The bones of the soldiers of both armies are
scattered over the fields, and the phrenologist may find skulls
enough. A monument has now been erected on each of the Bull Run
battle-fields. These monuments are of chocolate-coloured sandstone,
thirty feet high, and were erected by the officers and men of General
Gamble's separate cavalry brigade, camped at Fairfax Courthouse. The
monument on the first Bull Run field is situated on the hill in front
of the memorable stone house, on the spot where the 14th Brooklyn, 1st
Michigan, and 1st and 2nd Maine were most hotly engaged, and where
Ricketts and Griffin lost their batteries. The shaft is 27 ft. high,
and bears upon its top a hundred-pound shell. On the pedestal, at each
corner, is a shell of similar size. On one side of the shaft is
inscribed, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July
21st, 1861," and on the reverse, "Erected June 10th, 1865." The
monument at Groveton is similar in its proportions, bearing the
inscription, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Groveton,
August 29, 1862," and on the reverse, "Erected June 10th, 1865." Our
Illustration represents the scene at the consecration, or
"dedication," as it is called in America, of these monuments. The
religious exercises were conducted on the first Bull Run field by the
Rev. Dr. M'Murdy, who read an appropriate service, which was followed
by a hymn written for the occasion by Pierpont; a military parade by
the 5th Pennsylvania heavy artillery, Colonel Gallup; and a salute by
the 16th Massachusetts battery, Captain Scott. At the close of these
ceremonies, eloquent addresses were delivered by Judge Olin, General
Wilcox, General Heintzelman, and General Farnsworth. At the second
monument the services were similar to those described. A large party
of visitors had come from Washington to be present on this
occasion.</p></div2>

<p>The assassination trials are over, and the sentences partly carried
out. Payne, Harrold, Atzerott, and Mrs. Surratt were hanged on the 7th
inst. The Judge of the Supreme Court had previously served a writ of
habeas corpus on General Hancock, in Mrs. Surratt's case, which, by
President Johnson's order, was not obeyed. It is stated that Payne,
previous to his execution, exonerated Mrs. Suratt, and that another
person had subscribed to an affidavit impeaching the testimony of an
important witness against her. Dr. Mudd, Arnold, and O'Laughlin are to
be imprisoned, with hard labour, for life; and Spangler, the stage
carpenter, is to be imprisoned, with hard labour, for six years.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia the Provost Marshal having, by order from
Washington, surrendered a prisoner named Cozzens to the Sheriff, Judge
Thompson has since released him, declaring that the President's power
to suspend the habeas corpus conferred by Congress terminated with the
war.</p>
<p>President Johnson's health is somewhat improved, but he is still
unable to receive visitors. The health of Mr. F. W Seward continues to
improve.</p>
<p>Independence Day, the 4th of July, was celebrated with more than
usual demonstrations of loyalty.</p>
<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation appointing Benjamin
F. Perry Provisional Governor of South Carolina. All the seceded
States, except Florida, have now either provisional or elected local
governments. The details of reconstruction, however, are much more
copious than interesting.</p>
<p>General Grant authorises the statement that all the white volunteer
troops of the army would be mustered out of service at the earliest
possible day. It was probable that, by the middle of August, there
would not be 10,000 remaining in the whole of General Meade's military
division of the <sic>Atlanta</sic>.</p>
<p>Advices from the west report the capture of several desperate
guerrillas and murderers.</p>
<p>The military authorities of Richmond had taken precautionary
measures against an apprehended negro insurrection.</p>
<p>The Government are making arrangements to send to Atalanta a
sufficient quantity of supplies to relieve the necessities of the
people in that district, who for some time past had been reduced to
the last extremities of famine.</p>
<p>A committee of delegates, presenting the coloured population of
Virginia, was to meet in Alexandria on the 2nd of August, to consider
the condition and prospects of the race.</p>
<p>The number of applicants to the President for pardon average
between 200 and 300 a day. Papers were issued one day granting pardon
to 180, mostly North Carolinians.</p>
<p>The States of Wisconsin and Iowa have been visited by terrible
tornadoes. The village of Virogna, Vernon County, Wisconsin, a place of
about 1200 inhabitants, was nearly destroyed. Seventeen persons were
killed and more than a hundred badly injured. The loss of property was
very great. In Iowa the crops were badly damaged, railroads and
bridges destroyed, and serious damage done in several counties. Heavy
rains succeeding had caused disastrous floods.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Federal troops were landing along the Texas coast
and the mouth of the Rio Grande. Six thousand troops, mostly coloured,
had arrived at Brazos. A detachment had been sent up the river, and
occupied Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> states that the Government had

<p>The Great Eastern, laden with the Atlantic telegraph cable, left
the Nore last Saturday evening, and arrived off Valencia on Wednesday
morning. The Caroline, with the shore end of cable, twenty-seven miles
in length, was detained at Falmouth by bad weather until Monday, and
had to be taken in tow by the Great Eastern off Land's-end the same
day, and taken to Valencia during a heavy sea. The Terrible and the
Sphynx are also off Valencia. In consequence of a heavy rolling sea,
the Great Eastern was unable to communicate with the shore, and went
for shelter to Berehaven Harbour, Bantry Bay, where she will lie until
the shore end of the cable is laid--an operation which will occupy
about two days, and which was to be set about directly the weather
improved. Once started for the Newfoundland coast, the only danger to
be feared is a storm severe enough to drive the Great Eastern from her
course. Messages will be transmitted from the ship on paying out each
fifty miles, so that the public will be able to watch her course from
day to day almost as closely as those on board. On arriving at
Newfoundland a message, already prepared, will be transmitted to the
directors, and the receipt of this will be considered proof that the
line has been opened.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERATE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Government.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> published at a somewhat late
period, the series of four Illustrations which we give this week
cannot fail to prove of much interest to our readers. It must be taken
into consideration that our Special Artist at the head-quarters of the
Southern army had numerous difficulties to contend with in the
transmission of his correspondence to this Journal, and it is only now
that, by his arrival in this country, we are placed in a position to
avail ourselves of the last of his experiences in the Southern States
of America.</p>
<p>After the capitulation of General Johnston there was virtually no
armed force left east of the Mississippi; and President Davis, already
a fugitive from Richmond, having been driven from the capital of
Virginia by the surrender of General Lee, found himself again a
wanderer by the wayside, seeking some means of escape from the Federal
columns which were closing in upon him in all directions. Our Special
Artist, as we have already stated, accompanied Mr. Davis in his flight
to within forty-eight hours of his capture. A few of the sketches he
made, while following the ex-President, are now given to the
public.</p>
<p>One of these Illustrations shows the ex-President's train crossing
the Pe-Dee River, in North Carolina. This was a long and tedious
operation. There are usually no bridges over the swift watercourses in
this part of America, and very frequently no fords. Each waggon, with
its team of mules, had in this instance to be ferried across
separately, and this delay, with an enemy following in the rear, was,
to say the least of it, a very anxious affair. In fact, more than one
alarm of the approach of the Federal cavalry was given before half the
train had crossed the river, and the excitement amongst the rearguard
and teamsters was excessive. The horses of the cavalry escort were
made to swim the stream, being stripped of their saddles and their
riders of most of their clothes. The confusion at the landing-place
was enormous, as many of the frightened animals were scarcely in the
water before they threw their riders and struggled to the bank,
charging through the crowd of attendant cavalrymen. Notwithstanding
all this, the entire train passed safely over the Pe-Dee and many
other streams while our Artist was in its company, and the only
misfortune that happened to him was two or three good duckings.</p>
<p>Another Illustration shows Mr. Davis and his Cabinet halting by
the roadside; the ex-President engaged in signing papers which
Mr. Benjamin, his Secretary of State, is handing to him. This was
probably the last official business transacted by the Confederate
Cabinet, and may well be termed "Government by the roadside." Our
readers must bear in mind that at any moment the alarm might be given
of the enemy's advance, and, to say the least, such a condition of
matters was scarcely calculated to give calmness to the deliberations
of the fugitive Government.</p>
<p>The subject of another Illustration is the scene presented by a
sudden alarm, or stampede, which was a very frequent occurrence, owing
to the proximity of the Federal cavalry, who were frequently within
three miles of the camp of the flying President. A scout had only to
dash in and give the alarm when everything went helter-skelter along
the road--President, Ministers, cavalrymen, four-muled waggons, and
terrified negro servants, all jumbled up together.</p>
<p>The last of these Illustrations shows the farewell of Mr. Davis to
his escort and staff in the square of Washington, Georgia. It was here
that he determined to continue his flight almost alone; and,
assembling those round him who had sacrificed everything to the
defeated cause, he, with tears in his eyes, begged them to seek their
own safety and leave him to meet his fate. Undoubtedly, it was an
ill-advised arrangement which brought an escort of 1500 men in the
train of a man fleeing for his life; and, when too late, Mr. Davis saw
the error of thus attracting the attention of the entire country
through which he passed, and disbanded them but forty-eight hours
before his capture.</p></div2>

<p>...And so the Great Eastern is fairly off, and if in the ensuing
fortnight the telegraph cable is successfully laid down, amongst the
earliest news that runs along the line at the rate of four words a
minute will be that which relates the trial of Mr. Jefferson
Davis. There is now plenty of force in America, and the admirers of
Mr. Carlyle and a strong Government have their wish. No one can look
at a photograph of President Johnson without seeing that he is a man
of great capacity and of iron will. By-the-way, with what fervour
would the news be received in America (were it only true) of the
assertion that Carlyle had undertaken the Life of President
Lincoln. "Two men I honour," said that writer;" and no third: first,
the toil-worn craftsman that conquers the earth. Venerable to me is
thy hard hand, hardly-entreated brother! The second is the inspired
thinker....These two, in all their degrees, I honour; all else is
chaff and dust." "Unspeakably touching" is the Carlylese expression
for the effect the sight of the two labourers united in one person has
on him; and in Abraham Lincoln, the eloquent rail-splitter and the
martyred President, surely these were so. The life of a mad despot
like Frederick might possibly be atoned for by the really deeply
instructive life of Abraham Lincoln. Will Mr. Carlyle take it in
hand?</p></div2>

<p>The America Protestant church at Aspinwall was consecrated on June
15, the ceremony being performed by Bishop Potter, of Pennsylvania. A
large number of the residents of Panama, both native and foreign,
including the President of the State, the French Consul, and other
prominent inhabitants were present at the service. This is the first
Protestant church ever erected on the isthmus of Panama. It is built
of stone brought from the Pacific Railroad Company's quarry on the
isthmus, and has been erected at the cost of the company.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Things</hi> are looking favourable for the
Atlantic Telegraph. The shore end of the cable was successfully landed
at Valencia on Saturday morning last. Connections were made with the
instrument-room at 12.45 p.m., Greenwich time, in the presence of a
large concourse. The Knight of Kerry and Sir Robert Peel made
congratulatory speeches. Three cheers were given for her Majesty and
three for the President of the United States. The paying-out of the
heavy shore cable, twenty-seven miles in length, was completed by the
Caroline late in the evening. Shortly after four, on Sunday<pb
n="83"/> afternoon, the splice with the main cable on board the Great
Eastern was completed, and the paying-out began from the Great
Eastern. Disquieting rumours were circulated on Tuesday to the effect
that the cable was in danger of failure. We are glad, however, to
learn that the hitch which occurred had been put right, and that at
the time of our going to press all was working smoothly. Telegrams
continue to be received from the gentlemen on board the Great Eastern,
signalling that the work of laying the cable is proceeding
satisfactorily; and this gigantic vessel, herself one of the wonders
of the world, which is bearing across the Atlantic the wire that is to
make thought simultaneous in the two hemispheres, has so far advanced
on her voyage that we may indulge in hopes of its successful
issue.</p>
<p>A despatch from St. John's, Newfoundland, states:--"In anticipation
of the successful laying of the Atlantic cable a telegraph line has
been constructed from this place to Heart's Content, the point
selected for the landing of the American shore end of the cable. An
office has been fitted up there, and everything that can be done to
advance the securing of the shore end of the cable has been
performed."</p></div2>

<p>Silver Peak is believed to be as pre-eminent over all silver
mountains as the Iron Mountain of Missouri is superior to all other
iron deposits. Silver Peak is situated east of San Francisco, on the
eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, and nearly one degree south of the
city of Austin. It is some two miles from Castle Mount, an old extinct
crater, about 5000 ft. above ocean level. Near Silver Peak is an
extensive deposit of salt, and not far distant a hill of pure
sulphur. The whole country has a naked appearance, being quite
destitute of vegetation, and bristles with mountains scattered over a
plain of great extent. The dreaded "Valley of Death," upon the plains
of which, along the "old Spanish trail," travellers have suffered so
much, lies but a short distance to the south-east of the crater of
Silver Peak. Little Salt Lake, in Southern Utah, lies directly east of
Silver Peak. At first the searchers after deposits of the precious
metals confined their searches to the Pacific side of the Sierra
Nevada; but discoveries in New Mexico, Arizona, and Virginia city
induced a thorough examination of the east side of the Sierra
Nevada. This resulted in great success, the most brilliant of which is
found in the neighbourhood of Austin, on the line of the great
overland mail, where a city has sprung up within three years which,
Senator Nye says, contains a population of 10,000. From along this
line of exploration the miners are rapidly extending their operations,
both north and south. Recently (within six months) they came upon this
immense deposit near Castle Mount. Twelve exceedingly rich lodes, or
"ledges" as the miners call them, were discovered on that single
mountain. This discovery in an unexpected region is believed to be the
most valuable yet developed. The specimens--a great number of which
have been brought to New York by Colonel Catherwood--are certainly
very remarkable, and merit the attention of the whole financial
community. If there is no mistake--and with the specimens actually
before us we do not see how there can be--a new deposit, superior even
to the Comstock lode, which has furnished so many millions of silver,
is about to pour into our market its limitless supply of this precious
metal.--<hi rend="italic">New York Journal of Commerce.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAYING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the Supplement to this Number,...we
have given an account of all the operations connected with it till the
afternoon of Sunday, the 23rd ult., when the Great Eastern, having
joined the main length to the shore-end of the cable, twenty or thirty
miles from the Irish coast, started on her voyage across the
Atlantic. Next day, as we mentioned in our last week's Paper, a
telegraphic message was received from the Great Eastern, then lying
to, in lat. 52, long. 10, about eighty miles from shore, to say that
some defect had been found in the insulation of the telegraphic
wire. This mischief was supposed to exist about two or three miles
west of the shore-end of the splice, and it was believed to be caused
by the Great Eastern pulling on her end of the cable with too much
strain before the shore-end splice was properly completed. The time at
which this message was sent from the Great Eastern was half-past four
on the Monday afternoon. There was no apprehension expressed regarding
the complete and immediate repair of the damage, and the signals to
the telegraph-house at Valencia continued very distinct. The Hawk was
sent out that evening to go to the Great Eastern and see what was the
matter, while the Caroline was made ready to pick up the splice, if
needful, and repair the fault. Next day a telegram from Mr. Glass, at
Valencia, announced that "the cable was all right; there had been a
hitch, but all was now right." The Great Eastern, being in lat. 52,
long. 12, telegraphed on that day (Tuesday, the 25th) that "a small
fault had been discovered and cut out; she was now paying out again,
and the signalling was perfect; the weather very fine." The nature of
the accident was further explained next day when the Hawk had returned
to Valencia. In cutting off the loose ends of the twisted iron wires,
which form the external covering of the cable, a tiny shred of such
wire had been allowed to adhere to the composition which surrounds the
central electric wire at the core of the cable, and having come in
contact with the latter, had partially destroyed its insulation. This
piece of the cable, however, being submerged at a depth of not more
than two miles, could be raised again without much difficulty, and,
the faulty part having been cut out, a fresh splice could be made. On
the Wednesday morning the managing director at Valencia made the
following announcement:--</p>
<q><p>The Great Eastern telegraphs that the distance run at 9.50
a.m. to-day was 150 miles (nautical). The length of cable paid out at
6.50 a.m. was 150 miles (nautical). The signals are perfect. Weather
very fine.</p></q>
<p>At half-past seven on the same (Wednesday) evening, he again
reported, "All well. Two hundred miles of cable were paid out from the
Great Eastern at 3 p.m. to-day. All well."</p>

<p>...<hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> is scarcely so interesting as
usual, though it has some valuable papers. The most important is
Mr. Ludlow's sketch of the Presidents of the United States, somewhat
one-sided in its appreciations, but as lively and vigorous as most of
the productions of this very earnest writer. Jefferson scarcely
receives justice; the recent reaction in favour of the long-neglected
Hamilton having naturally operated disadvantageously to the statesman
who represented the opposite order of ideas. Both were eminent men;
but it is Jefferson's glory to have comprehended the genius of
republican institutions, while his rival scarcely disguised his
preference for a limited monarchy. The practical good sense of the
American people soon ascertained which of them was to be trusted, and
we have no doubt that its verdict will be ultimately confirmed by
posterity. Mr. Ludlow makes a strange mistake in calling President
Adams a Calvinist: he was precisely the reverse. Professor Cairnes, in
his paper on negro suffrage, discusses the most difficult question of
contemporary American politics. It is certain that the President
cannot confer the franchise on negroes without a violation of law, and
it remains for the advocates of the measure to show that such an
infringement is demanded by an imperious necessity. Professor Cairnes
argues the question very forcibly; but it is one that can only be
determined after the most mature consideration. The existence of such
difficulties is President Johnson's sufficient justification for
continuing to keep a tight grasp on the leading men of the
south....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAYING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLE.</p>
<p>...As most of our readers are probably aware, the shore-end of the
cable, extending 27 miles from land on this side of the ocean, was
manufactured separately from the main length of 2300 miles, by
Mr. W. T. Henley, of North Woolwich, and was conveyed to Valencia by a
vessel belonging to him, the screw-steamer Caroline, which the
Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company had chartered for that
portion of the work. This piece of the cable is the largest and
heaviest ever made, weighing above twenty tons to the mile, and
measuring 2&#x00BD; in. in diameter, at the shore end, but diminishing
gradually, in the last 500 yards outwards, to the ordinary size of the
main deep-sea cable, with which it has been joined. The core or heart
of it is a cable precisely similar to the main length, but wrapped up
in jute yarn, and covered outside by a winding of twelve strands of
galvanised iron wires, three wires to the strand, and each wire a
quarter of an inch thick. Its strength is estimated as equal to a
breaking-strain of ninety tons. Such is the shore-end cable...The
voyage of the Caroline to Valencia, burdened with this cumbrous
section of the telegraphic line, seems to have been the most
difficult and hazardous task that has yet been performed in the whole
progress of the undertaking. The Great Eastern, with the main length
of 2300 miles of cable stowed in three iron tanks, as lately
described--making, with 7000 tons of coal and her other stores, an
aggregate burden of 24,000 tons--left her anchorage at the Nore<pb
n="123"/> on Saturday, July 15; and, with her insufficient
steam-power, had enough to do in getting down the Channel, by screw
and paddles, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but, when she
came off the Land's End; on the Monday, she found the Caroline, which
had started ten days before, and had lain weather-bound a week in
Falmouth Harbour, unable to proceed without help. The Great Eastern
was then obliged to take the Caroline in tow, from the Monday to the
Wednesday morning, against a rough south-westerly wind and the
tremendous swell of the open Atlantic, which, though scarcely felt by
the huge Great Eastern, almost overwhelmed the unhappy Caroline. There
was real danger of her being swamped, or rather dragged under the sea,
as she went round the south coast of Ireland, on the Tuesday night, the
waves continually dashing over her decks from stem to stern, so that
the men on deck were up to their waists in water. The officers and
crew, who might have relieved themselves by casting off the tow-rope,
endured this severe trial rather than fail to perform their part of
the great work; but it must be considered that the Caroline was ill
chosen for this service, and that, with better arrangements, the
shore-end cable should have been safe at Valencia some time before the
Great Eastern set forth. As it happened, the tow-rope accidentally
breaking when a few miles off the Skelligs Rocks, at five o'clock on
the Wednesday morning, the Great Eastern first arrived alone at
Valencia, which is about twenty miles distant, and the Caroline made
her way in as soon as she could in the forenoon of that day. The Great
Eastern, after landing two or three of the official gentlemen
concerned in the enterprise, went into Bearhaven, in Bantry Bay, where
she was to lie securely till the Caroline should have completed the
laying of the shore end, in readiness to meet the Great Eastern and to
form the junction with the main length of cable some twenty or thirty
miles out at sea.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern was accompanied by H.M.S. Terrible and Sphinx,
which met her at Valencia, and are to keep with her in her voyage to
Newfoundland. It should have been mentioned above that the Great
Eastern was assisted likewise in her start from the Nore by another of
the Queen's ships, the surveying-steamer Porcupine, under
Staff-Commander Calver, by whose guidance she was enabled to pass
through a deep channel, recently explored and very seldom used, much
more convenient for her than either the Swin or the Alexandra channel,
ordinarily frequented by vessels leaving the Thames or Medway for the
North Sea. But we must return to the Caroline, where we left her, at
Foilhommerum in Port Magee, a narrow inlet of the strait which
separates the Isle of Valencia from the neighbouring coast of Kerry to
the south. To that remote part of the United Kingdom, thirty or forty
miles west of Killarney, had the Telegraph Construction Company
suddenly removed the scene of its operations, which we noticed so
lately at East Greenwich and in the Medway prosperously carried
forward under the eye of the London world; yet, by means of the pens
of the reporters...the public are now made acquainted with the
minutest details of this mighty work.</p>
<p>The road to Valencia, either from Killarney or from Kenmare and
Glengariff, at the head of Bantry Bay, was travelled not without some
delays by the few persons from London who, having made the best of
their way to see the landing of the cable, succeeded in getting there
on the morning of Saturday week. The local staff of the Telegraph
Construction Company had been engaged for some weeks past in various
preparations on the spot...The poles on which the wire is stretched have, for the most part, been replaced by
new and larger ones. It happened, rather unluckily, that one of these
poles had been knocked down, some say by "an impulsive Irish cow,"
others by a drunken Irish car-driver, on the very day the cable was
landed, so that the news could not be transmitted to us in London
quite so quickly as we should have been glad to receive it; but this
defect was soon repaired.</p>
<p>...The actual landing of the cable from the ship Caroline [took
place] in the small haven at Foilhommerum....This place lies just
under and within Bray Head, the mountain promontory which forms the
south-west corner of the Isle of Valencia, projecting into the
Atlantic Ocean. It is distant six or seven miles across the island
from Knightstown, the port, which occupies a position on the strait
like that of Sonderburg in the Isle of Alsen....A contemporary
reporter gives this description of the scenery:--"We now reach nearly
at the summit of the last hill a low wooden hut, painted black, and
not unlike the summer establishment of some watering-place
photographer. This is the temporary office of the Atlantic Telegraph
Company. Along the waste land, at some distance to the right, are half
a dozen thatched hovels, while a few feet from the grass-grown
turf-wall which divides the field containing this office from the
cliff, you look down upon the Caroline, which is in communication with
the land by a lengthy floating bridge of boats. To the right and left
precipitous rocks rise nearly 300 ft. from the sea, so hollowed at
each side as to give to the securely-sheltered little haven, which is
scarcely a mile from end to end, the conformation of a
horseshoe. Rugged, steep, and utterly inaccessible, save where a rude
and broken path has been formed by the cablemen, these cliffs are
studded with wild flowers and ferns, and variegated by large patches
of the brightest verdure, which alternate with masses of tangled
seaweed and huge blocks of slate and parti-coloured rock. Butler's
Island, a large grass-grown strip of stony ground stretching from left
to right, from the far point of the bay, lessens the opening to the
sea, and materially helps to shelter this beautiful nook, though, as
there is of course neither land nor breakwater between its entrance
and America, it will be readily understood that in rough weather it
presents a very different appearance to the one it wore
yesterday. Then all was smiling, sunny, and calm...The telegraphic colours, represented
by rosettes of red, white, and blue, made and presented by Lady Capel
Molyneux, decorated the coats or hats of those immediately interested
in the enterprise; and, out of the three or four hundred employed on
the boats and shore to assist in hauling the cable in, it is scarcely
necessary to say no two figures were attired alike. The high-collared,
swallow-tailed blue coat--new, perhaps, before the electric telegraph
was invented, and sadly soiled and threadbare now--worked side by side
with the ragged nondescript garment which had been fustian, but had
reached the stage of hardly-kept-together tatters. Shirts which
blushed darkly at being exposed; jersies blue, red, and brown; caps
and hats of every variety and shape; bare heads, bare legs, and feet,
and arms&#x2014;made up the line. The boats were similarly manned, and
continued this line from the stern of the Caroline, some 700 yards
off, so that the cable was passed literally from hand to hand from
ship to shore." The appearance of this long row of boats was very
striking, and they varied from the smart cutters of the ships and the
trim gig of the coastguard to the ordinary fishing-boat of the
coast. Besides those which formed the line, having eight or ten men,
labourers or fishermen, in each boat, to hand the cable along, there
were detached boats passing up and down, with the experienced persons
who were to direct the landing--about thirty-five boats in all. On
shore, where a trench, 2ft. deep, had been cut across the narrow beach
and up the face of the cliff, to receive the cable, a hundred or more
of the country people, encouraged by the presence of their popular
landlord, Mr. Fitzgerald, the Knight of Kerry, were pulling and
shouting in their Irish fashion, with the utmost enthusiasm, but with
less discretion--for, not being aware that it was necessary to bring
in and lodge upon the beach a certain quantity of cable in excess of
the distance from the ship to the shore, in order that it might be
passed up the cliff and across a couple of fields to the Telegraph
House, these Irishmen, as soon as they got hold of the end of the
future line of communication with America, threw it upon the ground,
and raised a wild "Hurroo!" This was caught and repeated by the crews
of the boats, who, concluding that their work was well done, at once
proceeded to heave the massive rope into the sea. From boat to boat
the first bad example was followed by all until, to the dismay of the
cablemen, who could not gain a hearing amid the continued cheers,
every fathom up to the stern of the Caroline was thrown overboard. The
result of this touching enthusiasm was that every foot had to be
underrun, preparatory to the whole operation beginning <hi
rend="italic">de novo</hi>. It took some time to effect this, during
which the Irish were silent enough.</p>
<p>"When the cable bad been underrun, hauled into the boats again, and
the shore end really began to come on land, and was stowed away in
gigantic circles at the foot of the cliff, the scene was one of
extraordinary animation. Numbers of men were in the water up to their
waists or shoulders easing the cable over the rocks, while along the
steep path up the cliffs was a close row of figures, men and boys, of
every rank, from the well-to-do farmer down to the poorest cottier,
all pulling at the cable with a will, and, as if in atonement for
their first fault of enthusiasm, obeying with silent and almost
childlike docility every signal made by Mr. Glass or Mr. Canning as to
when they were to haul or slack away." Mr. Temple, assistant to
Mr. Canning, with another of the staff, was in the water up to his
neck working as hard as any. By twelve o'clock the cable was well up
the groove which had been cut in the face of the cliff for its
reception; and from this point the work of carrying its massive coils
across the meadows to the Telegraph House beyond was soon accomplished; and
at a little before one o'clock the end, taken over roads, hedges, and
ditches, was brought close up to the house, or hut, a plain wooden
building, already mentioned....Here several of the gentlemen
chiefly<pb n="124"/> interested in the great enterprise were
assembled, with Sir Robert Peel, Chief Secretary to the Government of
Ireland, and Lord John Hay, who had both come with the Knight of
Kerry, having, as well as Mr. Glass, the managing director of the
Telegraph Construction Company (and manufacturer of the main length of
cable) been the guests of the Knight of Kerry, at his mansion of
Glenleam, Knightstown. The simple ceremony with which the cable was
introduced to the telegraph station has not been noticed by other
reporters, but our Artist says, "The end of the cable was taken up by
Mr. Glass and handed to Sir Robert Peel, who passed it through a hole
left for the purpose in the building which forms, pro tem., the
station, where it was speedily connected with the batteries in the in
instrument-room. A signal was then interchanged with the Caroline,
proving that the electric communication was perfect. Three cheers for
the Queen were called for meanwhile, and given with Irish warmth. The
Knight of Kerry briefly addressed the large concourse of ladies and
gentlemen, yeomen and peasantry, now gathered about him. He expressed
his gratification at this auspicious commencement of the work, and
called for three cheers for the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, and three
cheers for Sir Robert Peel. These were most heartily given, and, of
course, were followed by a speech from Sir Robert Peel...He spoke, with
his wonted energy, of the political, social, and commercial benefits
which would be secured if the cable should prove successful; and,
after invoking the aid of Divine Providence, called for three cheers
for the Queen and three for Mr. Glass. In replying, Mr. Glass said
that all human skill could achieve had been applied to the furtherance
of the object, which he hoped was now near its consummation. Sir
R. Peel, having called for three cheers for the President of the
United States, and the Doxology having been sung, Mr. Glass formally
announced the success of the test that had been just applied, and then
the men returned to the beach and filled in the trench in which the
cable lay. Soon after twelve the Hawk arrived from Knightstown, and
towed the Caroline out of the bay to lay the cable, which was done
slowly but safely, under the able superintendence of Mr. Canning,
chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company,
assisted by Mr. Henley and Captain White, the officer commanding the
Coastguard stations along this coast, and who has devoted much care
and attention to obtaining correct soundings along the route to be
taken by the shore end. The Caroline started from the bay at 2.10
p.m. (Irish time)....Telegrams were constantly received from the
Caroline at Foilhommerum station, showing that all was going on
well....It was nearly twelve o'clock at night when a message was
received by Mr. Glass that the Caroline had laid the whole of the
shore-end cable with perfect success, and that its electric continuity
was quite perfect.</p>
<p>On the next day (Sunday week) the operation of joining the shore
end of the cable to the main length was performed at about fifteen
miles beyond the most western of the rugged rocks on the coast of
Ireland. Here the Great Eastern, attended by the Terrible and Sphinx,
was approached by the Caroline, bearing the last half mile of the
shore end. The spectators of the work were on board the Hawk, a
steam-yacht belonging to Mr. Glass, which came upon the scene as the
cable was being drawn from the stem of the Great Eastern to the
Caroline. Among those on board the Hawk were Lord John Hay; Sir
R. Peel, M.P.; the Knight of Kerry, with his daughters, the Misses
Fitzgerald; Captain White, R.N.; and Captain Hamilton; with Mr. W. H.
Russell and Mr. Robert Dudley, who are appointed to be the historian
and the artistic illustrator of the voyage of the Great Eastern across
the Atlantic....Soon after one o'clock the coils of the deep-sea cable
were safely wound on board the Caroline, and the work of splicing them
at once commenced. This was done by stripping both ends of hemp,
outside wires, and gutta-percha for a short distance, till the copper
conductor of the line was laid bare, and pared down to a fine
wedge-shaped point at each end. The connecting conductors were then
overlapped in the form known as a "scarf" joint, and firmly bound
together with fine threads of copper wire, till the junction was made
even stronger than the main portions of the line. The threads and
conductor were then soldered together thickly, and strips of soft
gutta-percha, like bands of brown tape, were wound layer over layer,
and their edges closely pressed, so as to form one homogeneous mass,
till a certain thickness was completed. Then came a coating of
insulated material called Chatterton's compound, and then again
another layer of gutta-percha tape, until the whole was inclosed in
four rings of the gutta-percha and three of the compound. The joint
was then immersed in cold water for testing, and, the signals proving
perfect, the last protection of hemp and outside wire was added, and
the joint sunk again into the sea, that its perfectness as to
conductivity and insulation might be ascertained from the extreme end
of the whole length of the cable on board the Great Eastern. It was
past four o'clock before the last of these tests was concluded, and in
every case they proved to be most satisfactory. At 4.30 the signal was
given and the last fastenings which held it to the Caroline were cast
adrift, and, with a great splash, the final joint of the Atlantic
telegraph and the first thirty miles of its length went down slowly
into the blue water, the depth here being 100 fathoms. The Hawk then
gave the Great Eastern a parting cheer; the Great Eastern fired a
salute of three guns, took a turn ahead, and was fairly off; floating
from her trucks she bore the white jack, an American ensign, the
burgee of the company--the union jack and American stars quartered
together, the words "Atlantic Telegraph" being on the tail; a red
ensign, a union jack, and the French flag; and from her peak the blue
ensign, which she flies because Captain Anderson is an officer of the
naval reserve. In the five ships thus lying near together all the
British ensigns were used, the Caroline having red, the Great Eastern
and the Hawk blue, the latter because she ranks as a yacht, and the
two men-of-war white. Just before the start, the Captain of the
Terrible, who was on board the Great Eastern, consulting with Captain
Anderson, retired to his own ship, which presently took her place on
the starboard quarter of the big vessel, the Sphinx taking the port
quarter; and so they went away to the West. The Caroline had before
this turned her head to the shore, and now the Hawk followed, and soon
caught her; the Great Eastern and the men-of-war, which had been
passing out of sight on the horizon, were by this time discernible
only by the bank of cloudlike smoke which lay in the golden pathway of
the setting sun....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> are in the same state of anxious doubt
regarding the condition of the Atlantic telegraph cable as we were
left on Thursday week, when, as announced in our last Publication,
"No communication with the Great Eastern" was the saddening tidings
received from Valencia, rendered the more painful by following close
upon the heels of oft repeated telegrams, "All going on well." At the
time of our going to press with our early Edition, on Thursday night,
the Great Eastern had not arrived, as it was thought she might, off
Valencia, nor had any communication from or news of her been
received.</p>
<p>It seems that a "magnetic storm" came on about the time the signals
ceased; and the Astronomer Royal, observing its violence, was of
opinion that it might account for the cessation of electric
communication. Yesterday week, however, at 1.40 p.m. test was made
from the shore end--a process prohibited to the officials there
without special instruction, and the result was thus
telegraphed:--"Test taken for conductivity. Result shows accident to
cable; total loss of insulation or dead earth, 1250 miles from
Valencia." The following telegram has subsequently been received from
Mr. Glass, managing director of the Telegraph Construction and
Maintenance Company (Limited):--</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Valencia</hi>, August 7.--May's tests to-day
make the distance of the fault 1175 miles, taking the temperature of
the water at 31. I think the last distance telegraphed is right.</p>
<p>The logbooks of the Persia and the North American, between whose
courses the Great Eastern probably was, show that on the day the fault
or breakage took place she could have experienced no storm.</p>
<p>The shareholders in the Atlantic Telegraph Company held a special
meeting on Wednesday, when resolutions were passed converting the
shares into stock, and issuing &#x00A3;800,000 of shares, at a
preferential dividend of 8 per cent, for completing the existing
cable, and for constructing a second to be worked along with
it.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the signs of returning peace most
satisfactory to the observer of affairs in America during the last two
or three months was the disbandment, or, as it is there termed, the
"mustering out," of the various regiments composing the armies of the
United States. One of the stations appointed for this purpose was at
Hart Island, situated at the head of Long Island Sound, about twenty
miles from the city of New York. Since the early days of the war Hart
Island had been used as a general d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t for recruits, a
purpose for which it was admirably adapted by its healthful
situation. Our Correspondent visited the place some weeks ago, on the
invitation of Captain Barstow, Aide-de-Camp of General Dix's Staff,
who was the officer in charge of the arrangements for mustering-out
troops at this post, and had a fast-going steamer at his command. The
sketch of Hart Island which we have engraved was taken from David's

Saturday, August</hi> 12, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"There</hi> goes reason to roasting of eggs,"
says the very old proverb, implying that even the simplest affair of
life demands a certain amount of common-sense. What are we to think,
then, of men who have before them the most important and elaborate
problem which can occupy the minds of statesmen, and who apparently
begin by withdrawing common-sense from among the aids to the solution?
We allude, as will probably be guessed, to those of the American
politicians who, having to reconstruct the South, propose to give the
suffrage to the unprepared black population. It is difficult to deal
gravely with the idea; but, nevertheless, a powerful party erects it
into a principle, and threatens loudly in its defence.</p>
<p>In accordance with their usual gracious custom when a European
opinion is advanced on a question affecting the Americans, they may
begin by apprising us that the business is not ours, and that,
inasmuch as they have carried on a war without our interference, they
may be supposed equally capable of adjusting the administrative
difficulties arising out of that war. Both propositions we must take
the great liberty of disputing. The business is ours, in a great if
only a secondary degree. With the territorial arrangements of the
Americans, so long as our colonies are unassailed, we admit that we
have not much concern. Whether the States consist of one mighty and
glorious republic, which holds together the most opposite peoples by
force of a sentiment rather than by any natural or very reasonable
union, or whether they fall into two or three divisions, in accordance
with what would seem to be the dictate of instinct, are not
circumstances materially affecting ourselves. It is to our interest
that America should be prosperous and peaceful; and whatever
arrangements may most conduce to render her so must be favourably
regarded by us. It is with her internal condition that we are
concerned; and, looking at the subject from a commercial point of
view, and borrowing an illustration from commerce, we contend that we
have a right to be heard. We are doing much business, and we hope to
do much more, with the great house of Liberty, Johnson, and Co. If
that house chooses to carry on its business in what we think an
inexpedient fashion, and to bring under one roof a miscellaneous
assemblage of "stores" which might be better managed apart, we have no
title to complain. But, as we are very much interested in the success
of the great house, and as we desire to do a good deal with one
especial department, we are surely justified in protesting, when we go
in to attend to our own affairs with it, if, instead of meeting with
liberal managers and gentlemanly clerks, we are handed over to a body
of Ethiopian serenaders, who sit on the counters, neglect the
packages, and sing black ditties during business hours. This is the
sort of thing with which we are now menaced, and we therefore crave
leave to say that customers ought to be considered. The fact that the
Americans are as capable of adjusting administrative difficulties as
of fighting gallant battles is by no means made clear to us by the
other fact that a large number of persons in the States are favourably
inclined towards the Black franchise.</p>
<p>Now, we really cannot go into first principles every time that we
have to discuss important details. Such a process is dear to the
nature of vestrymen and the like, to juvenile debaters in societies,
and to that large class of individuals who, in private life, are known
and avoided as bores. We have often said, and we beg to refer to our
recorded sentiments, that we detest slavery; and, though we wish that
the American slaves had been freed gradually and peacefully, instead
of by a hideous war, we rejoice that slavery has been done away. But
we do not mean to be always saying this. It is with Sambo the American
citizen, and not Sambo the oppressed negro, that we have now to deal;
and we conceive that it is most courteous to that interesting person
himself to treat him in his new capacity, and only to glance at his
unfortunate antecedents when his ambition, or that of his absurd
friends, forces them upon our<pb n="131"/> recollection. We heartily congratulate
him on his freedom, and, that being said, we must use a little freedom
of our own.</p>
<p>The Abolitionists, or the least moderate and sensible among them,
are displaying the bigotry of men with one idea, and they refuse to
listen to the councils of men who have several ideas, and who will not
tolerate slavery of the mind. Having fought out the battle, and having
stricken away the negro's fetters, these pseudo-friends of his insist
that, in spite of the cramping process which he has undergone from
childhood, he is a mental athlete, and suddenly capable of all the
work for which others have had to be trained. Sambo, whose highest aim
had been the avoidance of more work than he was compelled to do, whose
chief happiness had been in fantastic dances and idiotic songs, or,
when he took to religion, in the lowest form of devotional
sentimentality, is now to be an elector, to weigh the merits of
statesmen, and to come dancing up to the ballot-box with an inordinate
development of shirt-collar in honour of the nation, and to record his
choice between Massa Chase and Massa Seward, should those gentlemen be
rival candidates. That such an idea should be seriously entertained is
almost incredible, but we wish that it were only funny. Were the
election one of a municipal councillor or a beadle, it would be richly
comic to see a jobbing tradesman or a pompous bumble soliciting the
support of a black patron and being answered with the ineffable air of
superiority which Sambo can put on; but the choice is to be of men who
govern one mighty empire and hold relations with half a dozen.</p>
<p>England has been so truly and zealously "anti-slavery" that she can
afford to speak out in this matter. It is a mockery to place the
franchise in the hands of the blacks in their present condition, as a
mass. The existence of a few score, or, at most, a few hundred, who
are educated, is nothing in the argument, save that it is the
invaluable exception. To return to our eggs. Charge a man with selling
you a dozen bad, and he exhibits a single fresh one among them, and
your own case is proved. So with the negroes. Those who pedantically
contend for their enfranchisement, for the sake of a sham consistency,
know perfectly well that they are not to be trusted with the most
ordinary business transaction; and yet it is to such a population that
the choice of political representatives is to be given. The shout of
laughter with which the idea has been received here will be echoed
again and again, but the proportions of the question make it too
important for mere laughter. We appeal to the sanity of America
against its bigotry.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...I see advertised for publication a "Legacy of Fun" bequeathed
by poor President Lincoln. This is probably an English reprint of a
pamphlet well known in the States, and widely circulated during the
lifetime of the lamented deceased, entitled "Old Abe's Jokes." A large
number of the witticisms attributed to Mr. Lincoln must be considered
apocryphal, and many of them are older than the oldest Joe
Millers. Take, for instance, the story of the Widow Zollikoffer's
negro--one of the best related of old Abe, although I don't know
whether it is inserted in the English collection. The Widow
Zollikoffer was a Dutchwoman, and lived in Bourbon County,
Kentucky. Every autumn she was accustomed to make vast quantities of
huckleberry jam; and her negro-man, "Jacky," having a sweet tooth, was
equally accustomed to devour the said jam whenever he had an
opportunity for so doing. One day the widow went out to pay a round of
visits, but, prior to her departure, she told Jackey that, to prevent
his stealing her sweet and sticky stores, she should chalk his lips;
an operation which, to all seeming, she then and there performed. Back
came the widow from her visits. "Well, Jackey," she said, "I hope
you've left my jam alone." "Oh, yes," missus," replied the faithful
African; "nebber touched um at all. Look at um lips!" and he exhibited
his large labials well coated with white. "Why, you rascal," cried the
widow, "<hi rend="italic">I never chalked your lips at all:</hi> I
only made believe!" Mr. Lincoln, it is said, was accustomed to relate
this anecdote, with the additional remark that all the members of his
cabinet were in the habit of chalking their lips. Now, the story of
the Widow Zollikoffer is delicately paraphrased from one in the
"Decameron" of Boccaccio, about a painter who set out on a journey;
and I have no doubt that, were it traced further back, it might be
found to have been one of the stock stories in the Book of t[h]e Sixty,
preserved in the Temple of Hercules.</p>
<p>Returning to Europe lately, I happened to be one hot morning in the
Rue St. Ferr&#x00E9;ol, Marseilles. I happened to see in a shop window
a photograph which I instantly recognised as that of Edwin Booth, the
American tragedian. It is a beautiful face, and one belonging to a
most virtuous and upright man, with whom I am proud to have been on
terms of friendship. I stepped into the shop, and asked the gentleman
behind the counter whose portrait it was. "<hi
rend="italic">Mais</hi>," exclaimed he, "it is Boot, the
assassin. Vilk Boot, <hi rend="italic">le mis&#x00E9;rable, le
l&#x00FB;che. La population Marseillaise en raffole.</hi> I have sold
hundreds within the past four weeks." Poor Edwin Booth! for his calm
features to be gibbeted all over the south of France as those of the
desperado of Ford's Theatre. I explained to the shopkeeper the
libellous error into which he had fallen; but he shrugged his
shoulders and said it did not much matter. He had plenty more orders
for "Vilk Boot," and they must be executed.</p>
<p>Of the real Wilkes Booth, the actual assassin, I may say, <hi
rend="italic">vidi tantum</hi>. I knew him first in Boston, and
afterwards in Canada. The last time I saw him was at Montreal, in
October, 1864, at a place called "Dolly's," next door to the
St. Lawrence Hall, and much frequented by the amateurs of "Mint
Juleps" and "John Collinses." There was Wilkes Booth "shouting"
bottles of champagne to the company generally, and jingling handfuls
of gold twenty-dollar pieces--rare enough in North America just
then. He told me he had sold his theatrical wardrobe, and was going
south. He was mad drunk; and, even without the aid of
champagne-cocktails, he was mad sober. The man was, to all intents and
purposes, a lunatic....</p></div2>

<p>Franklinite is a black vitreo-metalloid substance, found in New
Jersey. It is only slightly magnetic; is fused by the blowpipe with
some difficulty, and its composition, according to Berthier,
is--peroxide of iron, 66; red oxide of manganese, 16; and oxide of
zinc, 17. Hitherto it has been merely an object for the cabinet. We
now learn that, when it is combined with forged iron or steel, it
gives excessive hardness, which no tools can penetrate, and which is
not destroyed by the action of heat.</p></div2>

emigrants--of whom 52,730 were destined for the United States, 6643

for other parts of the world. More than a fourth part of the
emigration consisted of persons of English origin; but the number of
Irish emigrants was double that of English, and all the former, except
a few thousands, went to the United States. The Scotch who left their
native country were about 4600. The emigration to the United States
was not quite equal to that of the same quarter in either of the two

showed a decrease.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC  TELEGRAPH.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Arrival Of The Great
Eastern.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Great Eastern has at last arrived,
and the anxiety which had begun to be felt for those on board her is
at an end. That she has so far failed in the object of her mission is
scarcely any news, but the story of that failure is full of
interest. She arrived off Crookhaven on Thursday morning, and
furnishes the following particulars of the operations for laying the
Atlantic telegraph cable:--</p>
<p>The Great Eastern sailed from Valencia, after making the splice
with the shore end, on the 23rd of July, and continued on her voyage
to lat. 51.25, long: 89.6, being 1063 miles from Valencia, and 600
miles from Heart's Content, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. She had then
paid out 1212 miles of cable, when it parted, on the 2nd of August, at
12.35 p.m., in soundings of 3900 yards, under the following circumstances: --A partial loss of insulation having bean discovered,
the Great Eastern was stopped to recover that portion of the cable in
which the fault lay, electrical tests placing it probably within six
miles. The cable was passed from the stern to the bow of the ship for
this purpose, and, after getting in two miles of cable, the fault
being still overboard, the cable broke about ten yards in board of the
wheel at the bow, having been injured by chafing on the stern.</p>
<p>Two previous faults had been discovered--the first in soundings of
about 1000 yards, and the second in about 4100 yards--and had been
successfully recovered and made good; and in the first case ten miles,
and in the second two miles and a half, of cable were hauled in.</p>
<p>After the cable parted, a grapnel with two nautical miles and a
half of rope was lowered, the ship being placed so as to drift over
the line of the cable. The cable was hooked on the 3rd, and when 2200
yards of the rope had been hauled in a swivel in the latter gave way,
and 2800 yards of rope were lost, the cable having been lifted 1200
yards from the bottom. On the 4th a buoy, with a flag and ball, was
moored with 500 yards of rope to mark the place. It is in lat. 51.35,
long. 38.42.30.</p>
<p>From the 4th fogs said adverse winds prevented a further attempt
until the 7th, which was then made nearer the end of the cable, and
was unsuccessful from the same cause when the cable had been lifted
about 1000 yards. Another buoy was here placed in lat. 51.28.30,
long. 38.56.9.</p>
<p>A third attempt was made on the 10th, which failed on account of
the grapnel chain having fouled the flukes of the grapnel. The grapnel
and last 800 yards of rope came up covered with ooze.</p>
<p>A fourth attempt was made on the 11th, at 3 p.m., which also
failed through the breaking of the grapnel rope when the cable had
been raised 600 yards from the bottom.</p>
<p>The stock of rope having now become exhausted, it became necessary
to proceed to England for more and stronger tackle.</p>
<p>The practical conclusions unanimously arrived at by those [e]ngaged
in the various capacities in the expedition are as follow:--</p>
<p>Firstly--That the steam-ship Great Eastern, from her size and
consequent steadiness, together with the better control obtained over
her by both the paddles and screw, render it possible and safe to lay
an Atlantic telegraph cable in any weather.</p>
<p>Secondly--That the paying-out machinery, constructed for the
purpose by Messrs. S. Canning and Clifford, worked perfectly, and can
be confidently relied on.</p>
<p>Thirdly--That the insulation of the gutta-percha-covered conductor
improved when submerged to more than double what it had been before
starting; and has proved itself to be the best insulated cable ever
manufactured, and many times higher than the standard required by the
contract. The cause of the two faults which were recovered was in each
case a perforation of the gutta-percha through to the proper conductor
by a piece of iron wire found sticking in the cable. Electrically, the
third fault was analogous to the first. The difficulty may be provided
against in future.</p>
<p>Fourthly--That nothing has occurred to create the least doubt in
the minds of those engaged in the expedition of the practicability of
successfully laying and working an Atlantic telegraph cable; but, on
the contrary, their confidence has been largely increased by the
confidence obtained on this voyage.</p>
<p>Fifthly--That the Great Eastern steam-ship, supplied with
sufficiently strong tackle and hauling-in machinery for depth of 4000
to 5000 yards, there is little or no doubt of the possibility of
recovering the lost end of the cable and completing the line already
about two thirds laid.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern proceeds direct to Sheerness. All well on
board. She reports having parted company with H.M.S. Sphinx a few days
after starting. The weather was for the most part very calm, but often
foggy and rainy. A stiff breeze blew on two days; but, although the
sea washed over the Terrible, scarcely any motion was observable on
board the Great Eastern, her greatest roll being 7&#x00BD; degrees,
and her greatest pitching 1 to 1&#x00BC; degree. The cable paid out
beautifully, and, owing to its diameter and lightness, the strain
required to prevent too rapid egress never exceeded 14 cwt. Its angle
with the horizon during the paying-out rarely exceeded 9&#x00BD;
deg. No difficulty whatever was experienced in mooring the buoys in
the deepest water, two having been left behind moored with pieces of
cable that had been picked up from a depth of two miles. One of them
rode out a stiff summer gale, its position after nine days being
unchanged. Captain Moriarty's chronometers found the true position of
the ship to within a fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>The Terrible has sailed for Newfoundland to coal.</p></div2>

<p>A summary of the results of the last Census, in 1861, of the United
States and of Canada, respectively, establishes the following
facts:--That during the interval between the last Census and the
preceding one the decennial rate of increase of population in Canada
exceeded that in the United States by nearly 5&#x00BD; per cent,
Canada adding 40.87 per cent to her population in ten years, while the
United States added only 35.58 per cent to theirs. That she brought
her wild lands into cultivation at a rate, in nine years, exceeding
the rate of increase of cultivated lands in the United States in ten
years by nearly six per cent. Canada in 1860 having added fifty acres
of cultivated land to every hundred acres under cultivation in 1851,
while the United States in 1860 had only added forty-four acres to
every hundred acres under cultivation in 1850. That the value per
cultivated acre of the farming lands of Canada in 1860 exceeded the
value per cultivated acre of the farming lands of the United States,
the average value per cultivated acre in Canada being 20 dols. 87
cents, and in the United States 16 dols. 32 cents. That in Canada a
larger capital was invested in agricultural implements, in proportion
to the amount of land cultivated, than in the United States--the
average value of agricultural implements used on a farm having a
hundred cultivated acres being in Canada 182 dols., and in the United
States 150 dols. That, in proportion to population, Canada in 1860
raised twice as much wheat as the United States, Canada in that year
raising 11.02 bushels for each inhabitant, while the United States
raised only 5.50 bushels for each inhabitant. That, bulking together
eight leading staples of agriculture--wheat, corn, rye, barley, oats,
buckwheat, peas and beans, and potatoes--Canada, between 1851 and
1860, increased in her production of these articles from 57 millions
to 123 millions of bushels--an increase of 113 per cent, while the
United States in ten years, from 1850 to 1860, increased their
productions of the same articles only forty-five per cent. That in
1860 Canada raised, of those articles, 49.12 bushels for each
inhabitant, against a production in the United States of 43.42 bushels
for each inhabitant. That--excluding Indian corn from the list--Canada
raised of the remaining articles 48.07 bushels for each inhabitant,
almost three times the rate of production in the United States, which
was 16.74 bushels for each inhabitant. And that, as regards live stock
and their products, Canada in 1860, in proportion to her population,
owned more horses and more cows, made more butter, kept more sheep,
and had a greater yield of wool than the United States.--<hi

Mr. and Mrs. Hardinge's respective sufferings are recorded. The

it not been for her sex, would undoubtedly have been hanged early in
the war as a spy, and that the latter was a renegade from the Federal
cause--he will consider they were treated not too harshly by the
authorities, whom it would be absurd to hold responsible for
occasional vulgar brutality on the part of underlings. The book is in
eminently "bad style," and, with the assistance of the portrait upon
the frontispiece, will to a great extent destroy those charming ideas

<p>We read in the <hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi>:--"The
disproportion of numbers in the male and female population of all
rapidly-settled new territories of the west has often been commented
upon, and a large amount of gratuitous and disinterested advice has
been from time to time tendered to the excessive female population of
eastern districts in reference to emigration. One of the results of
the war in the United States has been to cause a large preponderance of
single ladies throughout almost all portions of the Union east of the
Rocky Mountains, and the attention of social economists has been
directed to the question of how such a large number of widows and
orphans are to procure a comfortable living and avoid becoming burdens
to the neighbourhoods in which they respectively dwell. Governor
Andrews, of Massachusetts, in his last message to the Legislature of
that State, suggested the propriety of some steps being taken in
regard to the surplus women, but nothing was done. His words, however,
seem to have met with a response from the other side of the
continent. In Washington territory the single men outnumber the single
women by eighty to one, there being less than one hundred single women
in the domain. The authorities of that territory, having their
attention called to the subject by Governor Andrew's remarks, have
undertaken to provide a free passage and good fare from New York to
Washington territory for 300 widows and orphans of Union soldiers
killed in the war. The Hon. A. S. Mercer, of that territory, has
arrived in New York to superintend the movement and see that none but
the most respectable parties avail themselves of the offer. The
steamer is to sail from New York for Panama on the 22nd of next
month. All grown-up girls and women accepting the offer are guaranteed
respectable employment at four dollars in gold per week, immediately
on their arrival, so long as they choose to avail themselves of
it. Although the voluntary transportation of 300 women from the
Atlantic to the Pacific coast is but a drop in the bucket towards
equalising the sexes in either portion of the country, yet it is the
beginning of a very interesting movement, and is sufficiently
extensive for experimental purposes. Should it prove successful, it
will soon be repeated on a larger scale, and engaged in, not only by
other western territories at their own expense, but with the active
co-operation of the States overburdened with surplus female
population."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE DIARY OF THE CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> has not read it? Whose pulse has not
fluttered in unison with the vicissitudes which its brief story
exhibits? Who has not uttered a deep-drawn sigh at its mournful
close--a sigh, nevertheless, having in it none of that bitterness with
which we bury dead hopes out of our sight? What "sensational novel"
ever swayed our emotions to and fro as this simple record has had
power to do? It has been truly said that "truth is stranger than
fiction," and this diary vividly illustrates the remark. Seldom,
perhaps, in the annals of civilisation has a mechanical experiment
been more graphically described--certainly never has any involved in
its issue results of higher importance. As an instance of scientific
insight and accuracy it raises our admiration to the highest pitch. As
representing a grand and all-but-successful struggle of art<pb
n="182"/> with stupendous and seemingly invincible obstacles, it has
its passages of intensest excitement. But every step of the narrative
carries along with it hopes and fears which regard ends of
transcendent moment--the linking together, by a kind of mystical
marriage-ring, the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; the bringing them
into daily presence with each other; and the unceasing assimilation of
the one to the other in all that relates to international converse,
commerce, friendship, emulation, progress. This as the "consummation
devoutly to be wished," the near prospect of which kindled enthusiasm,
as from both sides of the Atlantic the experiment was looked forward
to; and it is this which, ever in the mind of the reader, imparts to
the diary such a thrilling interest.</p>
<p>Well, the failure is one which prophesies success. It is
disappointing, but not disheartening. It must needs be accounted an
"adversity," but it has its "sweet uses." It has severely rebuked
carelessness, but, in doing so, has promised to greater care all that
is desired. The prize is too precious to admit of its being given at
random. It can be won by desert alone; but then desert will win
it. The grand but unfortunate attempt has taught us that, in more
senses than one, nothing is stronger than its weakest part. The
shackles of the wire-rope to be used for lifting the submerged cable
had not been made to bear the strain to which they were subjected, on
the presumption, probably, that they would not be required for
use. The utmost precaution was exercised in the construction and
coiling of the cable, with the single exception that, in splicing it,
a few wire ends were allowed to remain in the tanks. Everything was
successful which had been duly prepared with a view to
success--nothing gave way but that which previous calculation and
testing might have forewarned the operators would give way. Science
was not at fault. Art was not at fault where it did its best. It has
been proved to demonstration that the process of laying a perfect
cable across the depths of the Atlantic is not only feasible, but is
as capable of being rendered a certainty as any mechanical process
whatsoever. Human intelligence has gone up to Nature a third time with
its well-studied task, and a third time has been turned down--but this
time with a consciousness that every part of it has been really
mastered, and that it was prevented from passing only by a slip or two
which it can readily guard against in future. Hereafter there need be
no peradventure in the undertaking.</p>
<p>After a studious perusal of Mr. Russell's diary we are able to draw
up an account of the pros and cons affecting the late, and calculated,
if suffered to remain as they are, to affect every future
expedition. The facts of an assuring character are both numerous and
decisive; those which explain the failure are, happily, few and
remediable. The Great Eastern has proved to be thoroughly competent to
her work--steady in her course, easily steered, not materially
disabled by any changes of weather, and roomy enough to admit of any
requisite machinery and to carry with safety the enormous
indispensable amount of tonnage. The cable itself is a triumphant
success, sufficiently strong to bear its own weight, of the right
specific gravity, well fitted when laid to preserve the insulation of
its core, and likely rather to improve than to lose its conductivity
by deep submersion. The scientific skill of the electricians has been
so perfected as to enable them instantly to detect a flaw, and to
point out within a mile or so the place in the cable where it will be
found. The cable may be safely hauled in when necessary until the
fault has been found and rectified, and when the machinery for that
purpose has been strengthened and improved as experience suggests will
probably do its work with the utmost ease and regularity. Should the
cable actually part, its submerged end may be picked up from any depth
and lifted once more on board. All these conclusions have been proved
by actual trial. Yet the expedition failed. The failure, however, was
due to removable causes. Injury to the cable during the process of
paying out arose three times from precisely the same cause, and,
whether attributable to malicious design or to ignorant negligence,
may be certainly avoided hereafter. The repair of that injury on the
last occasion of its occurrence was frustrated simply by the fact that
the machinery provided for such a contingency had been less
scrupulously passed as sufficient than it would have been had it been
foreseen that the moment was coming when the success or failure of the
whole enterprise would depend upon it. That, also, will be guarded
against hereafter. Balancing the known elements of success against the
known elements of failure, we are warranted by reason in looking upon
a Transatlantic cable as not merely a possibility or a lucky accident,
but as a result lying as clearly within the limits of certainty as any
human work that is yet future can be. We now know all that has to be
provided, and that it can be provided, in order to realise the full
extent of our wishes in regard to this matter. We see clearly the
whole process by which this most splendid of projects may be converted
into an accomplished fact. In missing our way, this time, we have
discovered the true way for the next time. The problem is
solved. Henceforth nothing remains to be conjectured. Simple obedience
to known laws is all that is required.</p>
<p>The elements of success being such as we have attempted to
indicate, we congratulate our readers on the fact that the promoters
of the scheme have resolved to test them once more by actual
experiment. They have lost none of their confidence, nor has a
particle of their courage oozed away. What might have been their final
determination if the Great Eastern had returned immediately on the
severance of the cable can be matter of conjecture only. In that case,
possibly, the experiment would have been considered as one surrounded
by too many risks to invite repetition, and years might have glided
away before another attempt would be ventured upon. Happily, such was
not the case. The men to whose conduct the enterprise was intrusted
exhausted all their resources before setting their faces homeward,
and, in their efforts to recover the lost end of the cable,
demonstrated the practicability both of finding and securing it. The
most thrilling portions of the diary have proved also the most
useful. They record successes just where they were least expected,
marred by failures just where they may be surely provided against in
future. The effect of them was marvellous in dissipating gloom, in
reviving hope, and in inspiring confidence. The various telegraphic
companies interested in the completion of the undertaking wisely
concluded to resume operations forthwith. Their first intention was to
construct all the necessary mechanical appliances and send back the
Great Eastern in October to pick up the broken cable, splice it with
what remained on board, and finish the work which accident had
suspended. On consultation with Captain Anderson, however, they
substituted for this plan a much wiser one. The machinery of the Great
Eastern needs repairs, the completion of which would delay any
resumption of the enterprise until the season was so far advanced as
to multiply the risks. It has, therefore, been resolved to wait till
May of next year. Meanwhile, a second cable is to be manufactured,
which will be laid alongside of the first; and, should the effort
succeed, as is confidently anticipated, it is proposed that the Great
Eastern shall commence paying out the unexhausted portion of the old
line at Newfoundland, make for the spot where the fracture occurred,
fish up the broken end, splice it with the newly-laid portion, and so
provide the public with two lines instead of one. The details of this
plan will very likely undergo some modification; but, in substance, it
may be looked upon as adopted.</p>
<p>"None but the brave deserve the fair." Courage, patience, and
perseverance are the qualities which Nature most regards in those who
woo her. In the end, she evermore rewards them. That they have been
and are being conspicuously displayed in the conduct of the present
undertaking cannot be denied; that they may ere long receive the prize
for which they are striving will, we are sure, be the hearty prayer of
all who yearn for the onward and upward progress of the human
race.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE BREAKING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Cable On Board The Great Eastern.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> return of the Great Eastern, bringing
news of the failure of the attempt to lay the Atlantic Telegraph
Cable, the broken end of which lies nearly 2000 fathoms deep in the
ocean, distant about 1000 miles from the shore end in Foilhummerum
Bay, was announced last week; and the authorised journal of the
expedition, written from day to day by Mr. W. H. Russell on board the
Great Eastern, from Monday July 24, to Friday, August 11, has since
been published....</p>
<p>It may be recollected that, on the second day after starting from
the Irish coast, Wednesday, July 25, a fault in the electric
insulation of the cable was detected, and a length of ten miles which
had been submerged in the wake of the ship was picked up again to
examine where the fault lay; it was then found that a tiny piece of
loose iron wire had forced its way through the outer covering and the
gutta-percha surrounding the electric wire, so as to come in contact
with the latter; and, when this piece was cut out and a new splice
made, the fault was effectually cured. The cable had again to be
raised and examined in the same way, on the 29th, when the ship was in
2000 fathom water, 636 miles from Valencia, and 1028 miles from
Newfoundland. A total loss of electric insulation, or "dead earth," as
it is called, had been discovered about one o'clock that
afternoon. The ship was stopped at once, and, as soon as the
picking-up machinery could be put in gear, the end of the cable was
hauled in again over the bow, and the faulty portion having been cut
off and laid aside for a minute examination, the remainder was spliced
afresh, and the operation of paying out over the stern of the ship was
recommenced next morning....Slowly but surely the defective portion of
the cable was reached and cut out. "A very painful discovery," says
the journal, "was then made. An incision was visible in one strand of
the hemp covering an external wire, and, on unravelling the strands so
as to expose the insulated wires, a piece of broken iron wire was
found driven through the gutta-percha covering so as to project beyond
it on each side to the extent of the diameter of the cable; one end
was sharp, as if cut with a nippers, the other was broken off
abruptly; and the diameter, on the gauge being applied, corresponded
with that of the wire covering the cable. It was impossible to resist
the irritating and sorrowful conviction that such an injury was the
work of some hired cable assassin or some purposeless
malefactor. Mr. Canning showed the cable and the stab to the cablemen,
who admitted that the mischief could not have occurred accidentally;
and those who were in the tank when the cable was injured, being of
the same gang as that which was on duty when the other piece of wire
was forced into the cable, were transferred to different duties on
deck. The gentlemen on board the ship formed a corps of supervisors,
who undertook to watch in the tank turn about, and the men employed
gave their acquiescence." We may add that the names of the gentlemen
who performed this voluntary service were Mr. Cyrus Field, Captain
Moriarty, Professor Thomson, Mr. Varley, Mr. R. Dudley, Mr. H. O'Neil,
A.R.A., Mr. Gooch, M.P., and M. Jules Despecher, each twice a day for
two hours at a time.</p>
<p>We take from Mr. Russell's journal, without abridgment, his account
of the actual breaking of the cable, on Wednesday, the 2nd, which he
has justly called "a sad and memorable day." There had been a strong
gale the night before, but the ship scarcely felt it, and went on
paying out cable, without let or hindrance, at a high rate of
speed--seven knots an hour. "About daybreak the wind suddenly shifted
to N.N.W. and fell to a light breeze, and at 4 a.m. the course was
altered to N.W. by W.&#x00BD; W., the sea falling. Morning broke
beautifully, and the cable ran out easily, at the rate of seven miles
an hour. At 5.35 a.m., ship's time, the paddles were reversed by order
from the electricians' room. In fact, at 8 a.m., Greenwich time, or a
minute after, while the electricians were passing the first of the
half-hourly series of currents to the shore, the galvanometer detected
a flaw of electricity which indicated a serious fault. The tests gave
no result as to locality, for the fault was very varying, but it was
generally believed to be not far from the stern of the ship. While
Mr. Cyrus Field was on watch in the tank, a little before the time of
the accident, a grating noise was audible as the cable flew over the
coil. One of the experienced hands immediately said, 'There is a piece
of wire,' and called to the look-out man above to pass the information
aft, but no notice appears to have been taken for some time of the
circumstance. After the ship had been stopped, and the remainder of the
flake in which the fault was supposed to have occurred had been paid
out, a piece of wire was seen projecting out of the cable in the
fluke, and, on one of the men taking it in his fingers and trying to
bend it down, the wire broke short off. It was nearly 3 in. long, and
evidently of hard, ill-tempered metal, which had flown out though the
strands of the cable in the tank. The fault in the cable which had
gone overboard might obviously have been caused by such a piece of
wire, and there could be no doubt that the wire of the outer covering
of the cable was capable of inflicting injury on the gutta-percha it
was intended to protect. The discovery was in some measure a relief to
men's minds, because it showed that one certainly, and the second
possibly, of the previous faults might have been the results of
similar accident. It was remarked, however, that this fault occurred
on the same watch as all the previous misfortunes had occurred.</p>
<p>"As the fault was too serious to be overlooked, and as there was a
difficulty in detecting its situation, preparations were made to get
the picking-up apparatus ready. Previous to doing so, two cuts were
made in the cable, the first near the old splice, between the main and
the fore tank (cable all right); the second cut three miles inboard,
which showed the fault to be in that portion of the cable which was
overboard. The wire rope and the chain were now secured to the cable
forward, which showed a maximum strain of 23&#x00BD; cwt; and at 9.55,
Greenwich time, the cable was severed and went over the stern, 1186
miles having been paid out when the end splashed into the water. With
less difficulty than usual--in fact, with comparative facility--the
cable was hauled in over the bows at 10.8 am., Greenwich time. The
strain in it, according to the dynamometer, was from 50 cwt. to 55
cwt., though the latter figures represented the maximum only reached
on one occasion. We were nearly in 2000 fathoms of water; but it was
considered a favourable circumstance that we had not got a few miles
further, as we should have then been in the very deepest part of the
Atlantic plateau. As far as could be ascertained, the ship was now
over a gentle elevation, on the top of which there was only 1950
fathoms of water. The picking-up was, as usual, exceedingly tedious,
and one hour and forty-six minutes elapsed before one mile was got on
board; then one of the engine's eccentric gear got out of order, so
that a man had to stand by with a handspike, aided by a wedge of wood
and an elastic band, to aid the wretched engine. Next, the supply of
steam failed, and when the steam was got up it was found that there
was not water enough in the boilers, and so the picking-up ceased
altogether for some time, during which the ship forged ahead and
chafed against the cable.</p>
<p>"Let the reader turn his face towards a window, and imagine that he
is standing on the bows of the Great Eastern, and then, of course, on
his right will be the starboard, on his left the port side of the
ship. In front, fixed in the bows, is a large V-wheel, as it is
technically termed, with a smaller wheel of the same kind on the same
axis at each side, on which the cable is drawn as it is pulled up from
the sea by the picking-up apparatus, and thence is wound under the
dynamometer and drum-wheels till it has passed the breaks and is
coiled down aft in safety. There are at the bows of the Great Eastern
two large hawsepipes, the iron rims of which project nearly a foot
beyond the line of the stem. After two miles of cable had been picked
up the Great Eastern was forced to forego the use of her engines
because the steam failed, while her vast broadside was exposed to the
wind, which was drifting her to the larboard or left-hand side, till
by degrees an oblique strain was brought to bear on the cable, which
came up from the sea to the bows on the right-side. Against one of the
hawsepipes the cable now caught on the left-hand side, while the ship
kept moving to the left, and thus chafed and strained the cable
greatly against the bow, for now it was held by this projection, and
did not drag from the V-wheel. The Great Eastern could not go astern
lest the cable should be snapped, and without motion some way there is
no power of steerage. At this critical moment, too, the wind shifted,
so as to render it more difficult to keep the head of the ship up to
the cable. As the cable then chafed so much that in two places damage
was done to it, a shackle chain and a wire rope belonging to one of
the buoys were passed down the bow over the cable and secured in a
bight below the hawsepipes. These were hauled so as to bring the
cable, which had been caught on the left-hand side by the hawsepipes,
round to the right-hand side of the bow, the ship still drifting to
the left, while the cable, now drawn directly up from the sea to the
V-wheel, was straining obliquely from the right with the shackle and
rope attached to it. It was necessary to do this instead of veering
away, as we were near the end of the cut of cable.</p>
<p>"The cable and the wire rope together were now coming in over the
bows in the groove in the larger wheel, the cable being wound upon a
drum behind by the machinery, which was once more in motion, and the
wire rope being taken in round the capstan. But the rope and cable, as
I have tried to explain, were not coming up in a right line, but were
being hauled in, with a great strain on them, at an angle from the
right-hand side, so that they did not work directly in the V in the
wheel. Still, up they came. The strain was shown on the dynamometer to
be very high, but not near breaking-point. At last, up came the cable
and wire rope shackling together on the V-wheel in the bow. They were
wound round on it, slowly, and were passing over the wheel together,
the first damaged part being inboard, when a jar was given to the
dynamometer, which flew up from 60 cwt.--the highest point
marked--with a sudden jerk, 3&#x00BD; in. In fact, the chain shackle
and wire rope clambered, as it were, up out of the groove on the
right-hand side of the V of the wheel, got on the top of the rim of
the V-wheel, and rushed down with a crash on the smaller wheel,
giving, no doubt, a severe shock to the cable to which it was
attached. The machinery was still in motion, the cable and the rope
travelled aft together, one towards the capstan, the other towards the
drum, when, just as the cable reached the dynamometer, it parted, 30
ft. from the bow, and with one bound leaped, as it were, into the
sea."</p>
<p>...Mr. Canning, the chief engineer of the work, was standing close
by. Mr. Russell goes on to say:--"It is not possible for any words to
portray the dismay with which the sight was witnessed and the news
heard. It was enough to move one to tears, and, when a man came aft
with the inner end still lashed to the chain, and we saw the tortured
strands, torn wires, and lacerated core, it is no exaggeration to say
that a strange feeling of pity, as though for some sentient creature
mutilated and dragged asunder by brutal force, passed through the
hearts of the spectators. But of what avail was sentimental
abstraction, when instant, strenuous action was demanded? Alas!
action? There, around, spread the placid Atlantic, smiling in the sun,
and not a dimple to show where lay so many hopes buried. But there was
no blank despair, and if any felt despondency they suppressed the
expression of it, while by far the greatest number of those on board
were actually animated, not by the loss itself, but by the accidental
nature of the occurrence, to indulge in sanguine expectations of
ultimate success. Captain Moriarty was just coming to the foot of the
companion to put up his daily statement of the ship's position, having
had excellent observations, when the news came. 'I fear,' he said, 'we
shall not feel much interest now in knowing how far we are from
Heart's Content.' However, it was something to know, though it was
little comfort, that we had at noon run precisely 116.4 miles since
yesterday, that 1186 miles of cable had been paid out, that we were
1062.4 miles from Valencia, 606.6 miles from Heart's Content, that we
were in lat. 51 deg. 25 min., long. 39 deg. 6 min., our course being
76 deg. S. and 25 deg. W. The Terrible was signalled 'The cable has
parted,' and was requested to bear down to us, which she did, and
came-to off our port-beam. After a brief consideration Mr. Canning,
whose presence of mind and self-possession never left him, came to the
resolution to seek for the cable in the bottom of the Atlantic, and to
get out his grapnels and drop down on it and pick it up again."</p>
<p>We must reserve till next week our...attempts made in the next few
days (unfortunately, without success) to recover the lost cable, which
was twice found and hooked, and raised a considerable way towards the
surface, but proved too heavy for the strength of the lifting
apparatus. The Great Eastern remained near the spot eight or nine
days, and then, on the 11th inst., leaving two buoys to mark the
position of the cable, turned her head back towards Europe. Her
consort, the Terrible, went on to Newfoundland. The Great Eastern, as
stated in our last, arrived at Crookhaven, on the Irish coast, on
Thursday week. She came up the Channel on Saturday last, and lay-to
off Brighton, where some of the gentlemen connected with the Atlantic
Telegraph expedition landed and hastened to London. On Sunday, about
one in the afternoon, the Great Eastern reached her old moorings at
Sheerness. Some thousands of spectators were assembled on the beach
and cheered her as she entered the port; she was greeted also with a
burst of music from the band of the Marines on board the Formidable,
the flagship, under the command of Sir Charles Talbot, the
Commander-in-Chief at Sheerness station.</p></div2>

<p>A discussion has taken place in the Cabinet, at Washington, on the
subject of union reconstruction, and the President has expressed his
determination to adhere to the line of policy he had originally laid
down for himself.</p>
<p>The Federal army is being shorn of its huge proportions with
marvellous rapidity. Since May last 700,000 men have been mustered out
of the service, leaving on the pay-rolls about 330,000.</p>
<p>At the late elections in Kentucky the Opposition voters are said
to have been driven from the polls by the military.</p>
<p>General Palmer, of Kentucky, had addressed to President Johnson an
explanatory letter with regard to the position of slavery in
Kentucky. He says that, in order to relieve the towns into which the
negroes were flocking, he was obliged to grant them passes to cross
the river into Ohio. He estimates that there are not more than 50,000
slaves left out of the 250,000 at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>The emancipated negroes in various localities are adopting
measures to bring their claims to the suffrage before the people. A
call for a national convention to settle the question is being
extensively circulated in South-Eastern Virginia.</p>
<p>In Maine a Republican convention has been held, at which
resolutions were passed favourable to negro suffrage, and making the
abolition of slavery a condition to the admission of the southern
States into the Union; also urging the prompt trial and punishment of
Mr. Davis.</p>
<p>Provisional Governor Hamilton, of Texas, in a proclamation,
admonishes the Texans to dispel the prevalent delusion that slavery

Confederate army, and accordingly arrangements were made for a public
dinner at Raleigh. The authorities were, however, on the alert, and
the proceeding was forbidden.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah is still exciting the apprehensions of the
Americans; but Mr. Mason has explained in a letter to the London
papers that, as soon as the news of the termination of the war reached
this country, instructions were dispatched to the Confederate
commander to take his ship into the nearest convenient port and have
her forthwith disarmed. Mr. Mason "presumes therefore, that her hostile

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, August</hi> 26, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"We</hi> don't expect no good grammar here,
but you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> shut the scenes to." Such was
stated by the late Mr. G. A. &#x00E0; Beckett to have been a criticism
which he heard publicly addressed by a gentleman of the
chimney-sweeping persuasion to the manager of one of the inferior
theatres. One feels singularly inclined to adapt the remonstrance to
present circumstances, and address it to such of our American friends
as are grumbling and murmuring against England, and looking jealously
because we are exchanging courtesies with France. With such a press as
that of the States, and with universal suffrage in the hands of
persons who are led by such a press, it would be unreasonable to
expect argument, or even patient attention to the arguments of
others. But considering that five years ago all the inhabitants of the
States were "Americans," and that to censure one of them, North or
South, was to offend all; and considering that since that time a very
large portion of these Americans declared their belief that it would
be a good thing to divide the country into two parts, we may almost be
allowed to suggest that American gentlemen should settle matters among
themselves, and somehow induce the minority to assent to the views of
the majority before flying at strangers and threatening to fight them
because a few thousands here thought that seven millions there had
something to say for themselves. The American manager should "shut the
scenes to."</p>
<p>Will our friends over the water forget the war and all its glories
and miseries, for a few minutes, and just reconstruct American society
and reproduce American feeling as they existed a year before the
Sumter gun was fired. May we ask them, in all good nature, whether at
that time an English writer who should have said of the smallest
Southern State what all the Northern organs are now saying of the
whole South, would not have been abused with all the force of the
press and of public oratory in all parts of the Union? Is it not
notorious that no American ever could bear to hear a single syllable
against any other American? There was never any clanship like it,
except, perhaps, in Scotland; but there are but three millions of
Scottish people, and they are supposed to be all more or less related,
so that to insult a Scot is to abuse a family. In America there were
thirty millions all bound to "crack one another up," and they did
it. In travelling, could anything be more unlike than the mode in
which an Englishman and a Yankee spoke when a countryman of either had
disgraced himself. "A smooth-faced rascal, Sir," John Bull would say,
loud enough to be heard three quarters up the table-d'h&#x00F4;te,
"and I'm glad he's come to grief. His father got his peerage by
jobbery, and the whole family is no better than it ought to be. It is
a good thing that a scandalous lot will be cleared out of the public
service." And he gave a kind of Rhadamanthine nod of approval of his
own stern justice. Not so the American in similar circumstances:--"The
kind of treatment necessary in such cases, Sir, is not rightly
apprehended except by those who live in the localities, and the
gentleman you name has made his way to affluence from very humble
beginnings, and we do not judge such a man harshly, and he has much
influence with the people." Such were the different ways in which
Englishmen and Americans were accustomed to deal with their
fellow-citizens. We do not offer an opinion as to which was the wiser
course, or whether it is better to be perfectly frank and honest and
ignore all accidental ties, or whether we should wash all our dirty
linen at home: we only wish to remind the Americans that it was only
the other day that no stranger could, without offence, hint to one of
them that another was in the wrong. And now they talk of quarrelling
with us because, at a couple of thousand miles distance, and with no
information on which we could absolutely rely, some of us were not
ready at the shortest notice to call six or seven millions of
Americans thieves, rebels, traitors, murderers, and miscreants. We
simply put the matter on the ground of fair play.</p>
<p>Then, again, let them charge us with cowardice if they will; but we
perceive another awful peril from which we have escaped. Only suppose
that things had taken a different turn, and matters had been arranged
without an appeal to the sword. Suppose that the gun from Sumter had
awakened not rage, but common-sense; and that men who spoke the
English language had unanimously exclaimed that they were not going to
kill one another for tariffs or niggers, and that a convention should
settle all disputes. We heartily wish that such a solution had been
tried. But suppose, also, that John Bull had at once given way to all
those feelings which he is now abused for lacking; and, while things
looked like war, had opened his mouth in denunciation of the wicked
slaveowners and traitors;--why, as soon as peace had been made, both
sides would have turned upon the insolent Bull, and demanded how he
dared to expect anything but a calm and rational line of conduct from
American citizens. Nations ruled and schooled by a savage aristocracy
might go to war for red and white roses, for lovelocks and roundheads,
for stars of Brunswick and Popish warming-pans; but enlightened
citizens were not so to be dragged into bloodshed. And it would have
required all the civility possessed by Earl Russell to frame
despatches to avoid a castigatory war, such as that with which we are
now menaced because some of our upper ten thousand believed what the
American press had been so long saying about the aristocratic
character of the slaveowner.</p>
<p>We certainly should be exceedingly sorry if the hatred which is
stated to be prevalent against us in the States should take the form
of actual hostility. Should it do so, we believe that it will be in
opposition to the wishes and feelings of the Government of the States
and of educated citizens. But if a nation will give universal suffrage
to the scum of all lands, that nation must be prepared to find the
intruders troublesome, and moreover, disposed to fraternise with the
lowest and most ignorant part of the home population. It is chiefly
among politicians from these classes that the anti-English feeling is
kept up, and we could hardly wish that such a population did not hate
English institutions. We are content, for the present, to believe that
the hostile sentiments, of which we hear so much, are mainly those of
the classes whom all cultivated persons hold in contempt, and whom
statesmen endeavour also to hold in subjection. And, believing this,
we have, in all good-humour, appealed to the real American citizen to
look back to what he now calls "old times," but which are not so very
old, and to remember our relations as they then were, He was so stern
in teaching us that we were not to suppose any American ever in the
wrong that he ought not to be angry with us for being slow to believe
that<pb n="187"/> seven millions of Americans are such atrocious
monsters that they ought to be exterminated, and their property (over
&#x00A3;4000) given to other American gentlemen of more correct
views. But if menace and accusation go on, we may be apter pupils than
he imagines in learning to express ourselves plainly.</p></div2>

<p>...Here, however, is a stray leaf of the "enormous gooseberry"
plant. The colour-box used by William Hogarth, I read in a daily
journal, is in the possession of a certain Colonel in Jersey city,
N.J., United States. It is so many inches square and so many inches
deep. This historical paintbox, we are told, was purchased by one of
the Colonel's English ancestors "at the sale of Hogarth's effects,
which took place in London shortly after his decease." Now, that
Hogarth's colour-box, or his palette, or his snuffbox (if he took
snuff), or his wig should be in the possession of any lady or
gentleman in America or elsewhere, is perfectly feasible. This
particular "box" story, however, loses its credibility from the fact
that no sale of William Hogarth's effects took place shortly after or
for a great many years following his death. His widow, faithful Jane
Thornhill, clave to the house in Leicester-fields, and till she
died--a very old lady indeed, almost within the memory of men still
living--sold nothing belonging to her husband, save impressions from
his engravings. John Thomas Smith, the engraver, remembered very well
going to Mrs. Hogarth to buy a copy of "The Modern Midnight
Conversation," and the widow receiving him in the front parlour, and
showing him a milkmaid's head in oil from the hand of William. "They
said he could not colour," cried the good old dame. "They lied. <hi

somebody else's paintbox of which the New Jersey Colonel has got

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 19th ult.</p>
<p>It is stated semi-officially that Jefferson Davis is to be tried
in a civil court for high treason, that the writ of habeas corpus is to
be restored, and that military courts are to be suspended.</p>
<p>The ordinance prohibiting the Legislature from passing laws
imposing any civil disability, punishment, or forfeiture of estate
upon citizens engaged in the late civil war, or for political opinions
occasioned thereby, has passed a first reading.</p>
<p>It is now denied that there are any Cabinet differences at
Washington on the subject of reconstructing the Union.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> states that General Lee
has been offered and has declined the presidency of Washington
College, Lexington.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Committee of the Mississippi State Convention
has reported in favour of the State Constitutional Amendment
abolishing slavery.</p>
<p>The Maine Democratic Convention has indorsed President Johnson's
reconstruction policy.</p>
<p>The military authorities of Charleston have ordered all editors to
submit their leading articles to the authorities before
publication.</p>
<p>A frightful picture is drawn of the condition of Texas, the
interior of which is said to be reduced to barrenness, owing to the
neglect of agriculture, whilst society is demoralised and robbery and
outlawry are supreme.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Washington despatch
says:--"Statistics show that during the rebellion the Federal armies
captured over 300,000 prisoners, besides patrolling about 160,000 more
of the final surrender."</p>
<p>In New Orleans an extensive system of negro schools is in
operation. There are 230 teachers, and 15,000 children are taught in
the daytime, and 5000 adults at night. A military tax of one cent in
ten dollars is levied on all real estate to defray the expenses of
these schools.</p>
<p>On Aug. 1, 3394 bales of cotton arrived in Mobile, the largest
amount that has reached there in one day for a number of years.</p>
<p>A magazine in Richmond, containing 2000 rounds of shell and other

<p>Great excitement was caused in New York, on the 10th ult., by the
suspension of the banking-house of Kitchum, Son, and Co., in
consequence of the discovery of extensive issues of forged gold

estimated at from two and a half to five millions, involving in losses
several bankers and brokers. Edward Kitchum had absconded with upwards
of 600,000 dols. of the abstracted funds in his possession. A reward

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...Another "<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> man" has made his mark in
the Thunderer this week. Mr. Frank Lawley, some time special
correspondent of that journal in the Southern States of America, has
written a long and eloquent letter on the alleged maltreatment and
starvation of Federal prisoners in Southern prisons, exculpating
Mr. Jefferson Davis and General Lee from having in any way sanctioned
the cruelties to which it was alleged the captives of the Confederate
bow and spear were subjected at Richmond and Andersonville. Touching
the whole question of the treatment of prisoners of war, North and
South, during the late conflict, I venture to hold the opinion that
there is a great deal to be said on both sides. Just this time last
year I happened to be at Saratoga, and there I was waited upon by a
deputation of Southern exiles, ladies and gentlemen, entreating me, as
an Englishman, to move public opinion in my own country with a view to
the melioration of the wretched condition of the Southern soldiers
confined in Federal prisons. Then I bought in New York a large
photographic portrait of a Northern "bhoy," recently released from
captivity in the Libby prison, and who, by insufficient food, had been
reduced literally to the condition of a skeleton; but photographs as
painful might have been taken, I am afraid, of desperate cases of
atrophy in the Lincoln Hospital at Washington.....</p>
<p>In which I am reminded of another "live Yankee," as droll in his
way, in reality, as Sam slick was in fiction.  I have the pleasure to
inform my readers that "Artemus Ward" is coming, and that very
speedily.  He wrote me the other day from Buffalo, N.Y., introducing
an American gentleman whom I should have been delighted to welcome,
but whom, owing to my being at the period of his visit in the interior
of Africa, I unfortunately missed. "I shall be with you soon," quoth
Artemus, "with my Mormons and things." The "Mormons and things," in
the shape of a lecture on Great Salt Lake City, were found
irresistibly comical in the States. I wonder whether they would be
appreciated here. We are <hi rend="italic">so</hi> hard to please; and yet, if the public
roar with laughter at "Mrs. Brown at the Play," they surely ought to
scream with hilarity at the sayings of the drollest lecturer I ever
listened to. On the whole, I should advise A. W. to put on "a clean
biled rag," which is Artemisian for a clean shirt, and cross the
Atlantic. If his Mormons and things don't take, he will be at least
enabled to study some English peculiarities of which he can make good
use when he returns to the U.S.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH EXPEDITION.</p>
<p>...We now...quote, from the authorised journal of the expedition, a
narrative of the subsequent attempts to find and raise the cable, at a
depth of 2000 fathoms; the locality being, as stated, in latitude 51
deg. 25 min., longitude 39 deg. 6 min., which is distant 1062 miles
from Valencia, Ireland, and 606 miles from Heart's Content Bay,
Newfoundland--the nearest parts respectively of the European and
American shores. Immediately after the breaking of the cable,
Mr. Canning, the chief engineer, resolved to try and pick it up again
from the bottom of the Atlantic. This might have seemed a hopeless
task:--</p>
<p>"But, then," says Mr. Russell, in his journal, "what would they say
in England if not even an attempt, however desperate, had been made?
There were men on board who had picked up broken cables from the
Mediterranean full 600 fathoms down. The weather was beautiful, and,
although there were no soundings, and the depth beneath us was matter
of conjecture, it was settled that the Great Eastern should steam ten
or twelve miles to windward and eastward of the position in which she
was when the cable went down, out with the grapnels and wire rope, and
drift down across the track in which the cable was supposed to be
lying. Although all utterance of hope was suppressed and no word of
confidence escaped the lips, both were treasured in the fancy. The
doctrine of chances could not touch such a contingency as we had to
speculate upon. And now came forth the grapnels--two five-armed
anchors, with flukes, sharply curved and tapering to an oblique,
toothlike end, the hooks with which the engineer was going to fish
from the Great Eastern for a take worth, with all its belongings, more
than a million. The ship stood away some thirteen or fourteen miles
from the spot where the accident occurred, and then lay-to in smooth
water, with the Terrible in company. The grapnels, weighing three
cwt., shackled and secured to a length of wire buoy-rope, of which
there were five miles on board (breaking strain calculated at ten
tons), was brought up to the bows, and at 3.20, ship's time, was
thrown over and 'whistled through' the sea a prey to fortune. At first
the iron sank but slowly, but soon the momentum of descent increased
so as to lay great stress on the picking-up machinery now rendered
available to lowering the novel messenger we were sending down armed
with warrant of search for the fugitive hidden in mysterious caverns
beneath. Length flew after length over cog-wheel and drum till the
iron wires, warming with work, heated at last so as to convert the
water thrown upon the machinery into clouds of steam. The time passed
heavily indeed. All life had died out in the vessel, and no noise was
heard except the dull grating of the wire cable over the wheels at the
bows. The most apathetic and indifferent would have sacrificed much to
have heard the rumble of the cable again, and esteemed it the most
grateful music in the world. The electricians' room was closed, all
their subtle apparatus stood functionless, and cell-zinc and copper
threw off superfluous currents in the silent chamber of science. Away
flew the wire strands length after length--ocean was indeed
insatiable--'More!' and 'More!' cried the daughter of horseleech from
the black night of waters, and still the rope descended. One thousand
fathoms--fifteen hundred fathoms--two thousand fathoms--hundreds again
mounting up, till at last, at 5.6 p.m., the strain was diminished, and
at 2500 fathoms, or 15,000 feet, the grapnel reached the bed of the
Atlantic and set to its task of finding and holding the cable. Where
that lay was, of course, beyond human knowledge; but, as the ship
drifted down across its course, there was just a sort of head-shaking
surmise that the grapnel might catch it--that the ship might feel
it--that the iron rope might be brought up again, and that the cable,
if across it, might--here was the most hazardous hitch of all--come up
without breaking."</p>
<p>...The cable was grappled three times--namely, on the 3rd, the
7th, and again the 11th of August; it was lifted each time a
considerable way from the bottom; but the grapnels, ropes, and lifting
machinery were not sufficient to bring it to the surface. The
different places at which the cable was thus taken hold of were
several miles apart. On the first occasion, Aug. 3, the grapnel having
been let down overnight as above described, they began to haul in the
rope early in the morning:--</p>
<p>"At eight o'clock 300 fathoms were in, and it became evident to all
on board that the grapnel was holding on and lifting 'something' from
the bottom. And what could that something be but the cable? The
scientific men calculated the strain and determined it could not be
from the wire rope and grapnel solely, and it could only be inferred
then that, as the bottom of the Atlantic is free from rocks here, and
as the depth at which the rope began to resist agreed with the
supposed soundings, it had really grappled the prize. Presently the
spur wheel of the picking-up apparatus broke, and the operation of
taking in the rope became dangerous as well as difficult, for it flew
up at times with such force as to knock down those near it, and one of
the most valuable of Mr. Canning's staff received a severe cut on the
cheek, and another had an ugly injury inflicted on his face from that
cause. The weather, which had been very thick and hazy, now settled
down into a dense fog, and we lost sight of the Terrible; but the
conviction that the cable was really once more attached to the Great
Eastern, no matter how precariously, and no matter how far off,
afforded too much cause for congratulation, conjecture, and suspense
to allow much room for other thoughts. There was a chance--just a
chance--that the cable might be dragged up from the deep; and every
hundred fathom of hawser handed in over the bows was joyously
recorded, and marked as an additional step in the march of this
forlorn hope. The hawser toiled and pulled as if it were a living
thing, and struck out at a considerable angle from the bows, as if it
were towed by some giant force underneath and away from the
steamer. When 500 fathoms were in-board, the most sceptical admitted
the cable must be on the iron hooks, and anxiety and suspense rose
higher just as the probability of recovering the cable became less
wild. But at 3.20, ship's time, all our fears and hopes were abruptly
ended. The drum flew round rapidly, the tail of the rope flourished in
the air as it flew in-board, and with a light splash the other end
dived into the Atlantic. One of the iron swivels had yielded to the
strain. The rope used was divided into lengths of 100 fathoms, each
having a shackle at the end with a heavy iron swivel. The head of the
bolt of one of these had been drawn right through the iron collar as
900 fathoms had been secured. Not a moment was lost in deciding what
measures to pursue. It was rather encouraging than the reverse to have
made the trial so abruptly concluded; for it was demonstrated that the
grapnel could pick up the cable in more than 2000 fathoms, and the
only question now was whether the wire rope, or the cable itself,
would bear the purchase and weight of hauling up from such vast
depths. There was wire rope enough left to make another attempt to
save the cable. It was resolved that the best course to pursue would
be to steam to a point two miles eastward of the extreme end of the
cable, so as to have only a mile or so of cable to lift up in the
bight when the ship drifted over it, as the broken part would, it was
hoped, in coming up on the grapnel twist round the other portion of
the cable. Captain Anderson prepared to run fourteen or fifteen miles
back, and drift down as nearly as possible across the line of the
cable. A fog came on that afternoon, and the Great Eastern lay for the
night in a smooth sea. Next day she drifted thirty-four miles, which,
with twelve miles steamed, made forty-six miles from the position
where the cable parted. It was resolved to make a raft on which to
place a buoy to slip over with 2&#x00BD; miles of the cable itself
attached to a mushroom anchor, as soon as we had reached the spot
where they had grappled the cable the day before. When the Great
Eastern arrived at the place estimated she dropped the buoy, which has
a red flag above a black ball fastened to the staff and anchors, and
steamed off again. The fog continued all next day and the day after,
so that nothing could be done; the ship still drifted about. On
Monday, the 7th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the weather having
cleared, the grapnel, with 2500 fathoms of cable, was hove over. We
again quote the journal:--"So much was the machinery improved that the
grapnel was only half the time in reaching the bottom, and very soon
the diminution of the strain on the dynamometer showed that it was
resting on the ooze. The day turned out most favourable, a steady
breeze from the north drifting the ship towards the cable at the rate
of a mile an hour, broadside on. At noon excellent observations were
taken, which put our position at lat. 51.27, long. 38.42. For several
hours the grapnel dragged the bottom without obstruction, the
dynamometer indicated a varying resistance to its progress. At 6.15
the strain increased from 45 cwt. to 48 cwt., and soon began to rise
steadily towards 55 cwt., and thence to 60 cwt. Presently the anxious
eyes which were fixed on the compass and on the head of the Great
Eastern observed a very slight tendency in her head to come round to
the wind. It was slow--very slow indeed. The ship seemed loth to
notice the influence to which she was becoming plainly subjected,
disdaining the feeble clue which solicited her attention to the
labyrinth of cable beneath; but in an hour and a half she came round
from E.by S. &#x00BD; S. to E. &#x00BE; N. The strain was greater every
moment. There could be no longer any doubt. The cable was caught
again. Here was a triumph of seamanship and perseverance. The ship's
head was brought round to the wind by the screw, and the capstan
engine was set to work to aid the new machinery of the picking-up gear
to haul up the cable. The strain ran up to 66 cwt., and at eight
p.m. the ill-fated machinery broke down at the bow, and a slight delay
occurred, but the main part of the waste being transferred to the
<sic>capstain</sic>, the rope was steadily hauled in at the rate of 150 fathoms
per hour." At half-past eleven 300 fathoms were hauled in. All seemed
going on hopefully till next morning. Between five and six a.m. the
dynamometer rose from 82 cwt. to 85 cwt., and thence to 87 cwt., and
it was calculated that the grapnel with the cable was then rising from
the bottom. The rope had come on steadily at an average of 150 fathoms
an hour during the night:--"At 7.30 a.m. there was a strong expression
of confidence in our success, and great gladness on board. The one
mile mark was hauled in, and we had demonstrated the fact that a ship
could pick up a cable in 2500 fathoms of water and pull it one mile
from the bottom. The cable was now suspended 1500 fathoms, or one mile
and a half below us in ocean. We had signalled the good news to the
Terrible. In an instant more, whilst our flags were still flying, all
was over. One of the shackles and swivels which join each length of
wire rope to the other had come over the bow, had passed over the
drum, and was in the third round of rope taken in by the capstan, when
the head of the swivel-pin gave way, and quick as lightning, the end
flourishing the iron shackle like a mailed fist in the air right and
left, as if menacing with death the hardy enemy who dared stand in its
desperate way, glanced aloft and leapt exultingly into the sea, to
join the cable and the 1500 fathoms of wire rope which still hung from
the grapnel. Now all these shackles and swivels had been examined
minutely before they were put over, and every care taken to prevent
the recurrence of accident which had already frustrated our
exertions. The work was of Brown, Lennox, and Co.--no better names;
the strain was not near that put down as the breaking point, and yet
there was the painful result. The news was signalled to the Terrible,
and her answer had not long been flown when her boat put off with
Lieutenant Prowse to learn what course we were about to pursue. At
9.50 a second buoy, secured on a raft and casks, was lowered with 2500
fathoms of telegraph cable moored to a broken spar wheel. It carries a
black ball at the end of a staff, and below the ball floats a flag,
red, white, and red, in three horizontal bars. The buoy floats low,
and has been let go as close as possible to the spot where the grapnel
rope sank. If these buoys do not break adrift, they will be of great
service when a renewed attempt is made to lift the cable."</p>
<p>...These two buoys...are about ten miles apart. The one...(that
most deeply sunk in the water) is moored with nearly two miles and one
third of the electric telegraph cable attached to the "mushroom
anchor," and marks, as nearly as could be calculated, the spot where
the Atlantic cable broke and sank on the 2nd of August. This buoy was
lowered in lat. 51 deg. 28 min., long. 38 deg. 42 min....on the 4th of
August; and it bears at the top, in white letters, the word "<hi
rend="smallcaps">Telegraph</hi>. No. 5." The other buoy...was moored
on the 8th of August, and marks the spot where the wire hawser used
for the grapnel broke on the second occasion of the attempt at
grappling the cable. As the buoy first put down had been found to sink
low in the water, though based upon three tiers of timber logs, on the
occasion of launching the second buoy, the raft was made larger; and
four barrels, securely bunged, were lashed to the angles of the raft,
giving thereby greatly-increased buoyancy and height out of the
water. The flag of the first buoy is scarlet and the ball is under the
flag. The flag of the second buoy has three bars--scarlet, white, and
scarlet--and the ball is over the flag.</p>
<p>The next day was employed in readjusting and fortifying the
picking-up machinery and the grapnel tackle. The anchor capstan was
enlarged and strengthened also, with huge beams of oak and an iron
casing all around it, forming a huge drum of twice the diameter of the
ordinary capstan, for winding in the wire rope and great hawsers more
rapidly than they could have been wound on a less diameter; while the
"slack" was to be taken from this drum as fast as it accumulated, and
passed along a line of men to the place where it was to be coiled on
deck....<pb n="223"/>A party of the men on deck, near the bow end of
the ship, arrang[ed] the coils of rope previous to lowering the
grapnel for the last time, on the 11th of August. It had been lowered
the day before, but had failed to catch the cable. The rope and
grapnel having been hauled back next morning, preparations were made
for the next and final attempt.</p>
<p>"All the damaged rope was rejected and repaired, as far as the means
at the disposal of Mr. Canning permitted. A line, consisting of 1600
fathoms of wire rope, 220 fathoms of hemp rope, and 510 fathoms of
Manila, was prepared and carefully examined, of which 1760 fathoms was
pronounced good, the rest being rather suspicious. At 7.25 a.m. the
Great Eastern was alongside No. 2 buoy, the Terrible in company. At
11.30 the Great Eastern signalled the Terrible, 'We are going to make
a final effort,' and then, 'We are sorry you have had such
uncomfortable waiting.' The ship's head being W. by S., and the buoy
No. 2 bearing E. by N. about two miles, the grapnel was let go at 1.56
p.m., Greenwich time. The wind would drift the Great Eastern to N.E.,
right across the cable, and fore and aft canvas was set to overcome
the current. The grapnel soon touched the bottom, as the new machinery
enabled the men to pay out the rope at the rate of fifty fathoms a
minute. For some time the ship drifted onwards, but at 3.50 p.m.,
ship's time, the strain on the rope rose to 60 cwt. as it came in over
the bows, though it was taken easily by the new capstan improvements
effected by Mr. Clifford. The ship's head varied from W.N.W. to W. by
S., and as the rope came in the screw was set quietly to work at times
to keep it to the wind, which had increased somewhat, accompanied by
showers of rain. The dynamometer index rose higher and higher, till it
reached 80 cwt., and once, as a shackle came through, the machinery
flew up to 105 cwt. It was a certainty that the Atlantic cable had
been caught for the third time, and was fast held in the grapnel
coming up from its oozy bed. Is there need to say that the
alternations of hope and fear which agitated all on board reached
their climax? There was an intensity of quiet excitement among us,
such as men feel when they await some supreme decree. Some remained
below; others refused to go forward, where the least jar of the
machinery put their hearts in their mouths; others walked in the
saloon or upon the after-deck abstractedly. In the bows, Captain
Anderson, Mr. Canning, Mr. Clifford, and their men toiled on; and
thence came constant signals, through an acoustic tube and whistle, to
the bridge to go ahead with the screw, or to stop, as the strain on
the dynamometer indicated. Suddenly we heard the whistle and a cry of
'Stop it!' from the bow; and exclamations of grief and regret told us
our last bolt had been sped. At 9.40 p.m., Greenwich time, as 765
fathoms had been got in, a shackle on the hemp hawser passed through
the machinery, and in a moment afterwards the rope parted near the
capstan and flew over the bow with a whistling rush which carried
death with it like the march of a round shot. In all the crowd of
labourers not one was touched, because the men held onto their
stoppers and kept the end straight; but the danger appeared so great,
that with the shout 'It is gone!' mingled the eager demand from
Mr. Canning and others who rushed to the bow, 'Is anyone hurt?'
'None.' But there lay the cable beneath us once more, buried under
coils of rope and wire, to which, in an instant, had just been added
1750 fathoms more. Signal was at once made to the Terrible. Orders
were given to get up steam in all haste to leave the disastrous
spot."</p>
<p>The return voyage of the Great Eastern has been described. She was
lying off Brighton on Saturday week....We earnestly hope that next
year, when this machinery will again be put in use, the laying of the
Atlantic telegraph will be accomplished with the utmost facility and
safety.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Submarine Cables</hi>.--In Europe, Asia,
Africa, and Australia there are fifty-two submarine cables, which are
of the aggregate length of 5625 miles, and the insulated wires of
which measure 9783 miles. The longest of these is 1550 fathoms, and
the shortest 1&#x00BD; fathom. There are ninety-five submarine cables
in the United States and British North America, which measure
sixty-eight miles, and their insulated wires 133 miles. The overland
telegraph line between New York and the west coast of Ireland, through
British Columbia, Northern Asia, and Russia will be 20,479 miles long,
12,740 miles of which are completed. It has at length been resolved
that this line shall cross from America to Asia at the southern point
of Norton Sound, on the American side to St. Lawrence Island, and
thence to Cape Thadeus on the Asiatic continent. Two submarine cables
will be required for this--one 135 miles long and the other 250 miles
long. Cape Thadeus is 1700 miles from the mouth of the Amoor
River. The following are some of the submarine cables in operation,
with their length in statute miles, viz.:--Dover and Calais, 27
miles; Denmark, across the Belt, 18 miles; Dover and Ostend,
80&#x00BD; miles; Firth of Forth, 6 miles; Portpatrick and Donaghadee,
25 miles; across River Tay, 2 miles; Portpatrick and Whitehead, 27
miles; Sweden and Denmark, 12 miles; Italy and Corsica, 110 miles;
Corsica and Sardinia, 10 miles; Egypt, 10 miles; Italy and Sicily, 5
miles; Newfoundland and Cape Breton, 85 miles; Prince Edward Island
and New Brunswick, 12 miles; Strait of Canso and Cape Breton, N.S.,
1&#x00BD; mile; Norway, across fiords, 49 miles; across months of
Danube, 3 miles; Ceylon and mainland of India, 30 miles; England and
Holland, 140 miles; England and Hanover, 280 miles; Norway, across
fiords, 16 miles; South Australia and King's Island, 140 miles;
Alexandria, 2 miles; England and Denmark, 368 miles; Sweden and
Gothland, 64 miles; Folkestone and Boulogne, 24 miles; across rivers
in India, 10 miles; Malta and Sicily, 60 miles; England and the Isle
of Man, 36 miles; Suez and Jubal Island, 220 miles; Jersey and Pireu,
in France, 21 miles; Tasmania and Bass Strait, 240 miles; Denmark and
Great Belt, 28 miles; Dacca and Pegu, 116 miles; Barcelona and Mahon,
180 miles; Minorca and Majorca, 35 miles; Iviza and Majorca, 74 miles;
St. Antonio and Iviza, 76 miles; Norway, across fiords, 16 miles;
Toulon and Corsica, 195 miles; Holyhead and Howth, 64 miles; Malta and
Alexandria, 1535 miles; Newhaven and Dieppe, 80 miles; Pembroke,
Wales, and Wexford, 63 miles; Sardinia and Sicily, 243 miles; Otranto
and Avalona, 62 miles; Faho and Kurrachee, 1450 miles; Sweden and
Prussia, 55 miles; and Algiers and Sicily, 259 miles. The oldest
submarine cable has been working fourteen years and the youngest about
six months. The largest number of conductors is nine and the smallest
one. The lowest depth of water is in the case of the Toulon and
Corsica, which is 1550 fathoms; and the next the Barcelona and Mahon,
1400 fathoms, until they reach about fourteen fathoms of
water.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 26th ult.</p>
<p>The commission for trying Captain Wirtz on charges of conspiring,
with other Southern leaders, to murder Federal prisoners, and with
having actually murdered several, was set aside during the trial, and
a new commission substituted, omitting the names of Generals Lee,
Seddon, and Northrop. Wirtz's counsel objected to fresh proceedings,
and asked for time to prepare the defence. Eventually, however, he
abandoned the case. The President of the Court then appointed the
Judge-Advocate to defend Wirtz. Charges of horrible cruelty are made
against him, among others, "that he kept bloodhounds to hunt down
prisoners of war escaped from his custody, and that he caused several
of the prisoners to be inoculated with poisonous matter."</p>
<p>The Mississippi Convention has repealed the Secession ordinance,
and all others, except the revenue one, passed during the war. It has
passed the State constitutional amendment for the abolition of
slavery, and has memorialised President Johnson to pardon
Mr. Davis. President Johnson telegraphed to the Governor of
Mississippi, congratulating him on the progress made by that State
towards readmission to the Union. He also said that the Habeas Corpus
Act would be restored and the troops withdrawn as soon as the State
had progressed sufficiently to have returned to her allegiance.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Democratic Convention has given Mr. Johnson its
qualified support. It demands that measures shall be passed to give
the South immediate congressional representation and to save them from
negro suffrage.</p>
<p>The American ironclad fleet has nearly all been ordered out of
commission, and is to be laid up at League Island, on the Delaware
River, a few miles below Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The steamer Brother Jonathan, from San Francisco for Portland, was
wrecked near Cape Lincoln. She had from 200 to 300 passengers on
board, who were all lost with the exception of fifteen.</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre, at Washington, is being converted into a fire-proof
building, in which all the captured archives of the Southern
Confederacy will be kept. They will be under the charge of Dr. Francis
Lieber, of New York.</p>
<p>Mr. William Cullen Bryant has purchased the homestead, in his
native town, of Cummington, Hampshire county, Mass., and is refitting
it for a summer residence. He has been spending part of the summer
there.</p>
<p>A Soldiers' Messenger Corps has been established in New York, after
the example of the London corps of Commissionnaires.</p>

<p>Advices from Quebec to Aug. 26 state that in the Canadian House of
Commons, on Mr. Galt moving that the House do go into Committee of
Supply, Mr. Holton made an important amendment relative to the
enlargement of the St. Lawrence Canals, in connection with the
Reciprocity Treaty with the United States. After a long debate, in
which the Reciprocity Treaty and the scheme of the Confederacy was
fully discussed, the amendment was negatived by a vote of 78 to

<p rend="center">THE MAGAZINES.</p>
<p>...The principal feature of this month's <hi
rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> is Mr. Deane's narrative of the Atlantic
Telegraph expedition, which  would have been intensely interesting if
it had not been anticipated by the daily newspapers. It is, however,
quite equal in interest to any that has appeared; and if unable to vie
with Dr. Russell's for the eagerness with which it is devoured by
contemporary readers, will, at all events, stand a better chance with
posterity. Being written from day to day, while the cable was being
laid, it is much more animated and full of matter than the clever
summary in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>. Both writers imply a
strong opinion that the injury was <hi
rend="italic">designed</hi>--the work of "some demon in human form,"
as Mr. Deane styles him.</p>
<p>As with the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>, one of the best papers
in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> is an abridgment of an old
autobiography. The story of the Chomley family is full of interest,
and very pleasant as evincing the permanence of the good old English
type of the country gentleman....Readers fond of violent contrasts
should pass from the chronicle of the Chomleys to Mr. Conway's sketch
of that "great eddy of the mixed human elements of the whole
world"--New York. Like all he writes, it is very entertaining reading,
and is remarkable for a savage attack on the leviathan political
"wire-puller," Mr. Thurlow Weed, and a quiet assumption that the day
of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> is gone by--because, we
suppose, its circulation is only double that of any other paper. There
is a singular mistake about Aaron Burr, who is said to have spent the
last months of his life watching for the foundered ship that should
have brought him his daughter. In fact, Burr survived his daughter and
his expectations twenty-three years, so surely, even in this material
age, does poetical embellishment transform the history of the
best-known men....</p>
<p>A new narrative of the American Civil War is commenced in <hi
rend="italic">Blackwood</hi>, and promises to be a long one. The
writer is a Prussian dragoon, for whose manly proportions and strength
of muscle we have the editor's assurance, while we may take his own
for his good opinion of himself. Too much time is lost in
preliminaries, and the narrative bids fair to be characterised by that
unreasoning animosity which distinguishes most of the literary
monuments of Secession. As, however, the writer was General Stewart's
Aide-de-Camp, his story can hardly fail to possess some
value....</p></div2>

<p>According to the New York papers, there is a probability that
President Davis will be tried at Norfolk, Virginia, before Chief
Justice<pb n="255"/> Chase. It is added that General Butler is about
to be appointed to assist the Attorney-General in conducting the
prosecution. It appears that Mr. Davis continues to be strictly
guarded, and that he is not allowed the privilege of correspondence,
except with the counsel engaged in his defence. Fortress Monroe
despatches of the 31st ult. report that Mr. Davis is ill with
erysipelas.</p>
<p>The trial of Captain Wirtz continues, though not without some
hitches.</p>
<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation removing the trade
restrictions with the southern States on all articles previously
declared contraband of war, subject only to such regulations as the
Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe.</p>
<p>A letter from Philadelphia states that the President is
contributing by his conduct to add to the great party that is
gradually closing around him in support of his measures. He has given
the associated press authority to announce that the restoration of the
writ of habeas corpus will be ordered at an early day; has telegraphed
to the Mississippi Reconstruction Convention that the military will be
removed from the State as soon as the new Government is in successful
operation; has closed up the Provost-Marshal's offices in Wisconsin
and North Missouri, and turned the marshals adrift; and is gradually
reducing the military force all over the country.</p>
<p>It is announced that the cotton crop is this year likely to be
less than half an average.</p>
<p>A Union mass meeting has been held at Richmond, when resolutions
were passed to express indignation at the suspicion of the Northern
press and people that the Southerners were insincere in taking the
oath of allegiance, and to express their loyalty to the Government,
and also their acquiescence in the result of the war, including the
abolition of slavery. It was also recommended that similar meetings
should be held throughout the south.</p>
<p>The Democratic State Convention of Ohio was held on the 24th ult.,
and General George W. Morgan was nominated for Governor. The platform
adopted opposed centralisation, maintained the doctrine of States
rights according to the Virginia and Kentucky resolutions of 1798, but
denied the right or power of secession, denounced negro suffrage, the
suspension of the habeas corpus, and continuance of martial law;
considered the national debt a national curse; and, while regretting
the non-ratification, in April last, of the Sherman-Johnson peace
agreement, resolved to support President Johnson in all constitutional
efforts to restore the seceded States to the Union.</p>
<p>Bands of guerrillas still keep up an organisation in
Mississippi. The steamer Keoto was recently captured by them, the
officers and crew robbed, and everything portable on board carried
off. Outrages and murders are frequent. To check this lawlessness
Governor Sharkey has called for an organisation in each county of at
least one company of volunteer cavalry and infantry. Cotton-stealing,
by the negroes, is also prevalent.</p>
<p>E. B. Ketchum has been committed to The Tombs prison. A meeting has
been held of his creditors, when it was voted to accept a dividend of
60 per cent--50 per cent to be paid by Nov. 1, and the remainder in
three months. The liabilities are said to be 4,000,000 dols., and the
assets 3,000,000 dols. The firm of Thomas Ketchum will resume
business; but no provision will be made out of the assets for the
payment of E. B. Ketchum's forged cheques.</p>
<p>An extensive bed of pure white marble, susceptible of a lustrous
polish, and said to be sufficient in quantity to supply the whole
Mississippi valley, has been discovered in Sauk county, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>When last heard from, the Shenandoah was continuing her
depredations among the American whalers, and two Federal ships of war
have been sent in pursuit of her.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, September</hi> 16, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Once</hi> more the Americans have taken a step
in advance of the old countries, and we record the fact with some
humiliation, while giving the fullest and frankest recognition of the
good sense which has been officially displayed by our cousins. A legal
tribunal in America has solemnly declared the Spiritualists to be mere
jugglers, and has decided, therefore, that they must pay the jugglers'
tax to the State before their exhibitions can be permitted for the
future.</p>
<p>After what has from time to time appeared in these columns upon the
subject of the mischievous and impudent quacks in question, our
readers will not be surprised to see that we hail this decision, tardy
though it be, with unqualified satisfaction. The sentence which places
the knaves in their true position, which strips them of the mock
dignity into which they had lifted themselves by dint of audacious
profanity, and which puts them among the knife-swallowers,
fortune-tellers, and card-manipulators, is, of course, a most sensible
and righteous sentence, but that is not all. It formally degrades them
and makes them ridiculous while they tamely pay the tax, and subjects
for the care of the police if they dare to refuse to pay. They are
pronounced to be more or less diverting vagabonds. Had they taken this
position when they first showed themselves in England we should never
have noticed them, except with the goodnatured praise we give to any
other entertainer. A mountebank may not be a very dignified member of
society, but he may be an honest man. Honesty, however, and
Spiritualism are, it would seem, bitter enemies. Even the better
educated idiots, who allow themselves to be mystified by jugglers'
jargon and jugglers' tricks, and who profess a spiritual belief, can
never tell the exact truth when making a statement on the subject, and
they wriggle angrily under cross-examination. Better morals were not
to be expected from the illiterate and greedy quacks who trade upon
the folly of the believers, and it was still less to be expected when
we remember upon what trash, in the shape of evidence, Spiritualists
framed their miserable faith. To have said, "The world calls us
jugglers; we accept the name, and hope to convince, in spite of that
name," would have been the course of a philosopher. But to have said
this would have been to drive away 90 per cent of boobyism, which is
ever ready to be deluded, but insists upon gravity and long words from
the operators. So we had pretensions disgusting and even blasphemous,
puffs as unscrupulous as those of the quack medicine-venders, and
testimony as large as was desired and as valuable as the pickpocket's
alibi. Much mischief was done, much plunder was gained, and now the
country in which the humbug was invented brands it on the brazen
forehead with the word jugglery.</p>
<p>The news comes at a fortunate moment; for we perceive that the most
notorious of these spiritualistic quacks, after throwing the English
press off the scent by causing it to be circulated that they had slunk
back to America, have appeared in Paris, and are said to be making a
success. Portions of the French press are as unprincipled as portions
of that in America, and are as open to pecuniary influences, and we
have no doubt that bribery has done its work in the procurement of
many of the articles which we read. A cynical love of mystification
also characterises some of the French journalists, who revenge
themselves for much enforced silence by talking very wildly upon
topics on which they are left free. It is, perhaps, hard to refrain
from occasionally hoaxing solemn and pompous, but credulous, folks,
who give themselves superior airs--and this is not an unfair
description of a good many well-to-do people in Paris and
elsewhere. The two agencies we have indicated are working in favour of
Spiritualism in France--the hirelings are earning their pay and the
cynics are affecting to be astonished. Could we hope that these lines
would be translated by the respectable part of the French press, for
the benefit of their readers, we would ask that the Parisians may be
told that Spiritualists' quackery, having been exposed a hundred
times in England, in spite of the efforts of the quacks to avoid all
real investigation, became the laughing-stock of the people, until the
jugglers ventured into rather rougher company than that of the
metropolis, and then they were simply kicked out, and fled. If the
spiritual Parisians will accept cast-off Spiritualism from England,
after this information, of course the laugh will not be against the
jugglers.</p>
<p>So, the American tribunals having formally done that which had from
the first been done non-officially by all rational folk in England, we
shall, we suppose, not have common-sense insulted any more by American
quacks of the spiritualist kind. Any future "mediums" who may come to
us with their Transatlantic nasalities, will come as do the ingenious
vagabonds whose advertisements in some of our weekly contemporaries
are far more amusing reading than most of the new novels. We shall
know that, if they really come from America, they are licensed
tumblers, who have their tax-receipts in their trunks. With these, of
course, we can have no quarrel. If they choose to announce that, by
means of spectral hands, they can carry old guitars across the room,
with scraps of phosphorus stuck on them, and fools like to pay for
such an exhibition, this is a free country, and every man has a right
to amuse himself his own way, provided he annoys nobody else. Those
who do not like to pay spiritual prices for such tomfoolery have but
to wait until Christmas, when they will see it much better done in the
pantomimes. But all this is the business of the not very wise people
themselves. America exports no more spirits, and that is enough. The
seal of the Republic is on the article pretending to be spirits, and
we know that it is harmless.</p>
<p>But, unluckily, we have no jugglers' tax in England. Shakspeare and
Mozart cannot be played without a license; but a fellow may take a
room and call up the spirits of Shakspeare and Mozart without let or
hindrance. The police have no power of interference. We are still,
therefore, exposed to the humiliation of hearing that spiritualistic
quackery is freely practised in England. Sometimes we hear, with
extreme regret, that it is countenanced by families in other respects
creditable. If there is a son whose intellects are too exalted for his
father's office or counting-house, and who lounges at home on the
sofa, smoking, and lets hair grow all over his face, we learn, without
surprise, that the idle blockhead has strong convictions as to spirit
influences. If there is a spoiled and silly girl who has disgusted
sensible young men, and who cannot get an offer, we are quite prepared
to be told that she visits a spiritualistic family, and has had
revelations. The regular practitioners in the business look out for
such creatures, and practise upon them with as much honesty as that of
an advertising, puffing dentist, who privately avows that he never
expects or wishes to see the same victim twice. For such fools as
these whom we have described, for hysterical dowagers, for the
half-educated, and for the wholly silly there is at present no
protection like that which the American tribunal has luckily
devised. The jugglers will still penetrate into certain English
circles, and for hire will continue to do very great mischief. The
only effectual weapon which can be used against them is the press, and
that can perseveringly, and at the risk of being accused of monotony
and bigotry, proclaim that a hireling Spiritualist is a vulgar
rascal. That truth we have proclaimed upon various occasions, and have
been thanked for doing so, and we shall go on with our not very
agreeable work until the Vagabond Act shall be amended so as to bring
these abominable quacks within the reach of the law. We shall then
leave the Spiritualist to the policeman and hemp-picking. In the mean
time we offer our congratulations to the Americans that they have done
so much to remedy an evil which they certainly fostered, as the
keepers of their gaols and madhouses can testify. Their Spiritualist
is henceforth a juggler in law, as well as in fact.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">For</hi> many years, so those entitled to
decide declare, London has not been so empty as it now is. There
cannot be above two millions and a half of people left within the five
miles' radius. I took lately, for the first time these many months, a
walk down Regent-street and Oxford-street, by Waterloo-place to
Charing-cross, and so through Whitehall and Parliament-street to
Victoria-street. I was bound to do it, for I had with me an American
friend who, although he had inhabited Paris for eleven years had never
been in London before, and who was to leave the next day for New York
vi&#x00E2; Liverpool. The depletion of the fashionable quarters was,
to the eye of an experienced Londoner, as evident as on the Derby Day,
otherwise the only day in the year on which Babylon seems positively
empty. I was bound to show my Transatlantic friend all the lions in
the space of about seven hours. So, with the assistance of another
Londoner, we took him from Westminster to the Crystal Palace. There
was nobody there. Then we hired a fly, and drove him across country
through the exquisitely beautiful green lanes by Lewisham to
Greenwich. There was nobody to speak of at the Ship, and we each had
two waiters, speaking every European language, to attend upon us. It
is something after all to be able to give a friend whitebait for the
first time in his life. Our Yankee was quite a stranger to that
delicious fish, if it be a fish, which I doubt. It was a
sensation. "Well," he said, "it's the first time I ever ate
twenty-four pair of eyes at a mouthful." When he heard our companion,
who is a gourmet, order the waiter to be very particular in giving us
"black devil," as well as "red devil," after the first instalment of
"bait," he opened his eyes. Sensation the second. He started, too, the
ingenious theory, which he at once put into practice, that whitebait
are best eaten with the fingers, like the fried potatoes at the lake
of Saratoga. I am sure Brillat Savarin, had he ever become acquainted
with "bait," would have agreed with him. They won't give you a
soup-ladle, and they are always slipping off the prongs of your
fork. They are crisp and cleanly; what more do you require but nimble
fingers and a table-napkin. I commend this hint to the notice of
"Thalestris," the epicurean correspondent of the <hi
rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette.</hi></p>
<p>Now, when you have a foreigner with you, especially an American,
you like to dine him at your club, do you not? There may be a spice of
pardonable vanity in exhibiting to him the sumptuous palace, of which,
in consideration of a payment of half a score guineas per annum, you
are the twelve-hundredth part proprietor. Alas! the clubs have been
given up to the scrubbers, and plasterers, and whitewashers. The
carpets have been sent away to be beaten; the window-curtains have
disappeared; the library-shelves are bookless; the gorgeous flunkeys
are in mufti, and display their shapely calves in shorts and silks no
more. A flunkey in mufti is as unseemly an object as a soldier on
furlough, with his jacket unbuttoned and his neat stock replaced by a
coloured neckerchief. The very hall porter has gone out of town for
his holiday, and the page-boy who officiates as temporary janitor is
not quite certain about your name and gives you somebody else's
letters. This is the time for an adventurous stranger to risk the rash
essay of exploring, uninvited, the penetralia of a London club.</p>
<p>The Athen&#x00E6;um is being completely restored, renovated, and
beautified, inside and out; and, with its new coat of stucco and
frieze cleared from the smoky accumulations of twenty years, makes a
noble appearance at the corner of Pall-mall. The few members who
remain in town are enjoying the courteous hospitality of the Senior
United Service; but I am told that some of the waiters, accustomed
even as they are to hot-spoken colonels and peppery major-generals,
complain of the short tempers of the Athen&#x00E6;um bishops. A right
reverend father over an ill-cooked chop must be fearful.</p>
<p>The mention of my Yankee friend reminds me that a very distinguished
American officer and man of letters is sojourning among us just
now. My readers may have seen a recent letter in the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi>, signed "H. A. Wise," on that dreary topic of
the treatment of Federal prisoners by the Confederates, and pointing
out that which Northerners and Southerners alike should acknowledge as
an undoubted fact--that the manuscript order to burn Richmond and slay
Jefferson Davis alleged to have been found on the corpse of Colonel
Ulric Dahlgren, who fell in a Quixotic raid on the Confederate
capital, was a wicked forgery. <hi rend="italic">Mais laissons
l&#x00E0; ces mis&#x00E8;res</hi>. "H. A. Wise" is Captain, commonly
called "Commodore" Wise, a very distinguished officer in the United
States navy, the head of the Bureau of Ordnance at Washington, and the
author of a most amusing book of travels in Mexico called "Los
Gringos," and of a wonderfully-sensational nautical romance called
"Captain Brand of the Centipede." To all English tourists who have
visited Washington, and in particular to all those gentlemen who have
been attached to her Majesty's Legations in that woful city, the name
of kindly and humorous "Commodore" Wise must be familiar, and will
awaken the pleasantest reminiscences.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FENIAN MOVEMENT.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland</hi> is a singularly unlucky
country. Her best opportunities scarcely ever have time to become
visible and awaken hope before they are knocked over by some
unexpected casualty. An evil sprite seems to dog her footsteps and
watch for occasions of tripping her up as soon as her course is
onward. She had already begun to prosper and take heart, after the
fearful calamity of the potato blight, when she was thrown back again
into trouble by three bad harvests in succession. She is just
beginning to recover from the despondent mood into which they plunged
her, and now she is infested with political boils and blains in the
shape of Fenianism. There can be no doubt that this disease has been
imported from the West, that it spreads by contagion, that it fastens
upon the lowest class of the community, and that at present it defies
all curative treatment. Unfortunate Ireland! She may have her
shortcomings, but really want of good luck seems to be among the worst
of them.</p>
<p>We should do Ireland and the Irish great injustice if we should
deal otherwise than compassionately with her and hers, under this new
infliction. The political malady, the ugly symptoms of which are now
attracting attention to the sister isle, is by no means national. As
it was not indigenous, so neither is susceptibility to it produced by
what may be called native causes. Difference of race, of religion, of
political party, of social standing, will sometimes explain the sudden
appearance and presence of political epidemics; but to none of them is
the phenomenon of Fenianism in Ireland fairly attributable. Celt and
Saxon, Catholic and Protestant, priest and clergyman, Conservative and
Liberal, residents in towns and farmers in the country, alike denounce
and dread the fever, and are alike anxious to see it effectually
stopped. It preys only upon ignorance, and a very moderate amount of
knowledge is an almost certain prophylactic against it. It is in
Ireland, but not of Ireland. It is not formidable; it is not even
likely to become so; but its very existence is mischievous, And
perhaps its chief power for mischief resides in its aptitude to divert
public attention from the real and the removable disadvantages of
which Irishmen may justly complain; and to lessen the sympathy between
the two countries. For Ireland's sake, therefore, far more than for
that of England, it behoves the Government to crush the evil in the
egg.</p>
<p>No one can wonder at the extreme reluctance of Lord Wodehouse to
grapple with sedition in so strangely ridiculous a form. Fenianism may
be vigorous enough on the other side of the Atlantic, and, perhaps,
has in view aims which if they are not recommended by good feeling are
at any rate feasible. The hatred of England which there organises
itself in a sort of open conspiracy might, possibly, if encouraged by
President Johnson and Mr. Seward, leave its mark upon Canada; but over
here, in Ireland, "the brotherhood" are simply pushing a number of
silly young people into a dangerous position. It is not to be
imagined, for a moment, that the rulers of the United Kingdom, any
more than the rulers of the United States, will tamely witness a
disintegration of the empire. It is not conceivable that the union
which the all but illimitable resources of Great Britain are pledged
to maintain is likely to be torn asunder by a mere transatlantic
faction; or, if Ireland could be temporarily occupied by them, that
they could permanently retain it. Nothing could be more farcical than
the supposition that what would require an immense and well-organised
force, acting in aid of strong national feeling, to effect, will be
accomplished by a few secret societies, in each of which there is a
traitor, and which can pretend to no better means of compassing their
end than that of drilling the silliest of the peasantry by
moonlight. Altogether, the swagger of Fenianism has been so loud, and
its means so contemptible, that the Irish Government is really to be
excused for having let it alone until now. Of course, it knew
everything accurately enough; for conspiracy evermore breeds plenty of
cowards who will vie with each other in selling information to the
police. It may be pardoned, therefore, if it hesitated to interpose in
so supremely ridiculous an affair. It was entitled to hope that<pb
n="278"/> the plot, if there was one, would be suffocated by its own
absurdity. That hope having proved vain, it became a merciful
Government to dissipate a delusion which could only injure its unhappy
dupes by drawing them into closer connection with crime; and we trust
that what it has done it has done so completely as to save the
guiltiest from worse perils than any to which they are now
exposed.</p>
<p>When Lord Wodehouse has made up his mind to move, he moved to some
purpose. Having quietly taken full precautions against an outbreak, he
committed the execution of his plans exclusively to the civil
force. They were quite competent for the occasion. Simultaneously, or
nearly so, they took complete possession of the centres of the
confederation. They began their work on Friday, and by Saturday
evening they had laid hands upon nearly everybody and everything
connected with Fenianism in Ireland which may be said to have
constituted its vitality. The <hi rend="italic">Irish People</hi>--the
representative journal of the brotherhood--together with the chief
portion of its staff and effects, was cleverly captured in Dublin; the
leading conspirators in Cork were at the same time noiselessly
arrested. Here and there, in other districts, active officers of the
confederacy were taken. After the braggart speeches addressed to
Fenians in America, which hinted at the complete organisation of some
half-million of enthusiastic brothers in Ireland, all waiting
impatiently the signal for rending the Union in twain by irresistible
force, the upshot of this sudden raid by the police is, as might have
been anticipated, contemptible enough. One might be almost entitled,
but for other evidence of the most decisive character, to imagine that
the authorities had been misled as to the proper places for casting
their nets, so utterly insignificant is the take which they have
landed. If, indeed, they have not got hold of the brain and heart of
Fenianism in Ireland, where are they? How is it that in this crisis
they do not appear? How happens it that no trace of them can be
discovered? What are the half million of sworn and organised
conspirators about, that they suffer a few hundred police men to haul
their brethren through the streets and securely lodge them in prison?
Perhaps they were taken by surprise; but four or five days have since
elapsed, and not a sign of their indignation is to be seen. On the
contrary, the almost universal feeling of Ireland, so far at least as
it has been displayed hitherto, is one of satisfaction. Now, this
could not have been if the Irish population were to any appreciable
extent mixed up with this burlesque of a national conspiracy. There
would have been a visible show of sullenness on a somewhat extended
scale, even if there were no movement; or, if not sullenness, then
fear, arising from a consciousness of being compromised. But there is
neither. Dublin and Cork go about their ordinary business as
heretofore, and only think and talk of what has happened as they would
of any other matter of public curiosity and gossip. We conclude,
therefore, that all that there was of Fenianism which required to be
put under restraint is already within the grasp of the Executive
authority; and that the little bubble which has just burst really
constituted the windy force which mystery and brag had exalted into a
power capable of defying and dethroning the Queen of the United
Kingdom.</p>
<p>Thus far, then, Ireland fairly claims congratulation that she has
proved herself so slightly susceptible of the political virus which it
was sought to infuse into her blood. There have been times in her
history when the base attempt might have been more successful, although
we are not aware that the Irish nature ever manifested any strong
affinity to Republicanism. These times, happily, have passed away, and
the number of Irishmen having anything to lose are few who can discern
any promise of national prosperity and progress in separating the
destiny of their country from that of England. We are convinced that
their loyalty will, if possible, increase the desire of the Imperial
Parliament to deal considerately, justly, and generously with Irish
interests. We trust, moreover, that even in regard to this travesty of
treason Government will unite lenity with firmness. The emissaries
from America, who have so gratuitously striven to get up a rebellion,
will not, we hope, be elevated into comparative dignity by having, on
conviction, to suffer the penalty of death. A sufficient term of penal
servitude will better become them, while their dupes may be even more
indulgently treated. It is not always politic to render to crime when
allied with excessive folly the full measure of its legal deserts, and
we venture to believe it will not be thought so in this
case. Hitherto, the affair has assumed all the features of a farce--it
would be a great pity to convert it, by unnecessary rigour, into a
tragedy.</p></div2>

<p>..."More Last Words" from Mr. John Ruskin have appeared on the
vexed question of domestic servitude; but all the brilliant rhetoric,
subtle argument, and overflowing illustrations, from classical authors
and others, of an accomplished scholar and earnest thinker will not, I
am afraid, enable Materfamilias to cut the "gordian knot." A lady,
writing to a contemporary, and taking a purely Church-catechism view
of the question, places it, I must confess, in a very practical light;
and her reasoning, fifty years since, would have been held
irrefragable. The poor, she points out (quoting Scripture), are never
to cease out of the land; the poor must not expect the luxuries which
riches only obtain; servants belong to the poor--<hi
rend="italic">ergo</hi>, they should know their stations, refrain from
pining after "luxuries," and think a holiday once a month quite
sufficient. In a word, they should be content to do their duty "in
that state of life into which it has pleased God to call them." But
what is the state of life into which anybody is called? Who, by the
help of industry, education, and good conduct, does not hope to rise
above his origin? Is the ambition to rise a sin? The grandfather of
the first Sir Robert Peel was a day-labourer. Should his descendants
be contented to remain in the "state of life" into which their
grandsire was "called"? An American girl will very rarely condescend
to be a servant at all; but when she does enter a household as a
"help" it is merely with the desire to save up enough money to
purchase a wedding trousseau. One Transatlantic "help" I knew went
away and married a shoddy millionaire; and I saw her afterwards, all
ablaze with diamonds, at the New York Academy of Music. The Catechism
view was very tersely formulated by Mr. Dickens in "The Chimes:"--
<q>Oh! let us love our occupations,<lb/>
Live upon our daily rations,<lb/>
Bless the Squire and his relations,<lb/>
And always know our proper stations.<lb/></q>
The good lady on whose letter I have enlarged states that she has had
twenty years' experience in teaching and training girls for servants,
providing them with situations, keeping up a correspondence with them,
and inviting them annually to a tea-party; but it does not appear to
hare struck her that, as the facilities for education increase and as
servants become better educated, exactly in a proportionate ratio do
they become ambitious to do something better than wait at table, clean
the knives, and make the beds, with "a day out" once a month, and "no
followers allowed."...</p></div2>

<p>...In America the same rumours of an intended Fenian invasion
prevail as in Ireland. The New York correspondent of the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi> states that the Fenians are remarkably active
in the northern States, and that large funds are being collected and
sent to Ireland, or expended in the purchase of arms. The Roman
Catholic Archbishop of St. Louis, much to his own honour, has gone so
for as to exclude members of the association from the rites of the
Church. The Fenians at Springfield, in Illinois, have issued an appeal
to the Americans for funds to aid an "uprising people." They assert
that no "oppressed people" has ever been blessed with a more complete
organisation than the Fenian Brotherhood. The day has been fixed for
the establishment of a provisional government: 200,000 men are sworn
to sustain it; the American and Irish officers who have joined the
movement are silently making their way into Ireland; and operations
are to be inaugurated sooner, much sooner, than any of you can
believe. Each steamer on her arrival at Queenstown from New York or
Boston is boarded by the police, who, as a telegram states, search the
passengers' luggage for arms or treasonable documents.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">The Story of the Great March</hi>. By Brevet
Major George Ward Nichols. (Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.) Hamlet
calculates, upon certain data connected with his father's death and
his mother's second marriage, the probable duration of a great man's
fame. According to a similar calculation, therefore, it is just
possible that the world still cherishes some faint memory of the
assassination of an honest man and the termination of a great war; for
it is less than six months since Lincoln was sent before his time to
sleep with Washington, and the heroic Lee and cautious Johnston, with
inferior numbers and inferior resources, were forced to succumb to the
tenacity of Grant and the daring of Sherman. Our newspapers have had
the Atlantic telegraph, sensational murders, the cattle plague,
international f&#x00EA;tes at Portsmouth and Cherbourg, the romantic
tale of the bridegroom groom, and the like interesting topics to take
the place of "the latest news from America;" but, perhaps, there yet
lingers amongst us sufficient interest in the late War of Secession to
make men anxious to read the true story of that wonderful march which
is unequalled in the annals of military matters, which has made the
name of Sherman illustrious to all time, and which contributed as much
as, if not more than, any achievement to crush the Southern
Confederacy. The writer of this "Story of the Great March" served upon
General Sherman's Staff from the commencement of the "retreat" (as it
was the fashion, in certain quarters, to term it) from Atlanta to the
conclusion of the war; and his account should be, and there is no
reason to doubt is, trustworthy. It is written in a "popular" style,
and is illustrated in a "popular," not to say sensational, manner. It
is founded upon a diary kept by the writer, and is interspersed with
all sorts of anecdotes, amusing and saddening. It will very likely
disappoint the scientific reader, who would look for a masterly
criticism of Sherman's motives for his daring project; of the grounds
for hopes of success; of the rules of war violated or conformed to in
the conception and execution of the design; and of the precedents for
such or similar (if there be any such or similar) undertakings; and
there will be some who will find fault with the writer's style--saying
that it is not sufficiently elevated for the subject and remarking how
very differently the late Sir William Napier would have treated the
history of a gigantic campaign, but the average reader will no doubt
like it better as it is. The author, in his preface, writes by what
seems to be a curious inversion, "I have told their story simply, and,
I hope, honestly;" for it certainly does appear that a writer might be
more doubtful about his simplicity of expression than his honesty of
purpose. That the humorous element is not wanting to the narrative one
can show (premising that a "bummer" is an unauthorised forager, or, in
plainer language, a self-elected plunderer, which is much the same as
a robber or thief) from the following extract (p. 166):--"During the
skirmish in front of Fayetteville, one of our Captains, who was in
advance of his men, crept, in a citizen's coat, up to a fence, in
order to get a better look at the enemy....Suddenly he was confronted
by a ragged and barefooted fellow, whom he instantly recognised as one
of the 'bummers.' The recognition, however, was not reciprocal; for
the 'bummer' exulted in the thought that he had caught a Rebel, and
proceeded to salute him thus--'Halloa! just stop right thar,'
surveying his extremities; 'I say, come up out o' them boots.' 'I
couldn't think of it,' was the reply; 'they're a fine pair of boots,
and they are mine.'...'Come out o' them boots. P'raps you've got a watch
about your breeches-pocket; just pull her out. No nonsense, now; I'm
in a hurry to get arter them Rebs.' 'Perhaps you would like a horse?'
'A horse?' (the bummer's eyes sparkled). 'A horse? Wall, now, you jis
come up out o' them boots, and we'll discuss that ar' hoss question
sudden. Where is the hoss?' 'Oh! he is right near by, in charge of my
orderly.' 'Thunder! are you an officer of our army? I thought you was
a Reb.' And then the 'bummer' went to the rear under arrest, disgusted
beyond measure." If there were many 'bummers' in Sherman's army, it is
not surprising that the robbed and infuriated Southerners executed
lynch law upon some.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">The Life of President Andrew Johnson</hi>. By
G. W. Bacon. (Bacon and Co.) A compilation from cyclop&#x00E6;dia,
annual, newspaper, and all that kind of literature, combined with
information (not of a voluminous character) from "private American
sources." The whole amounts to not much more than was already known,
which, in a few words, is that Andrew Johnson was born of very humble
parentage at Raleigh, North Carolina, on the 29th of December, 1808;
that he was at a very early age apprenticed to tailoring; that, as he
sat on his shop-board and listened to a benevolent gentleman who read
to the journeymen, he was fired with the ambition of learning his
letters; that he learned them self-taught, or assisted only by his
fellow-workmen; that soon after (1825-6), setting up in trade for
himself (or as a journeyman) in Greenville, East Tennessee, he married
a wife who was also his schoolmistress and taught him the mysteries of
the three <hi rend="italic">r</hi>s; that in 1828, and twice
subsequently, he was elected alderman, and, in 1830, mayor of
Granville; that after three years of mayoralty he was, in 1835,
"elected member of the State Legislature for the county of his
residence;" that, in 1843, he became a member of Congress, and was
returned to Congress for nine successive years from that time; that,
in 1853, he was raised to the dignity of Governor of Tennessee, to
which office he was re-elected in 1855, and which he "filled until
1857, when he was chosen to a seat in the United States Senate;" that,
on the 19th of December, 1860, he spoke and was virulently assailed
for speaking strongly against "the right of secession;" that he was
burnt in effigy at Memphis, and received many other proofs of the
estimation in which he was held by Secessionists; that after the
capture of Fort Donelson, and consequent evacuation of Nashville, in
1862, he was appointed Military Governor of Tennessee, where, on his
own responsibility, he proclaimed freedom to the slave; that, in 1864,
in appreciation of his sufferings for and devotion to the Union, he
was elected, and, on the 4th of March, 1865, inaugurated,
Vice-President of the United States; that on the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln he became, according to the provisions of the
Constitution, President; and that, in fact, he has risen from the
lowest position through every disadvantage to the height of mighty
kings; that, in a comparatively short space of time, he has shot up
from the soil and reached the dimensions of a notable
mushroom. Mr. Bacon gives several extracts from the President's
speeches; but, either from partisanship, or, it is preferable to
think, delicacy, makes no allusion to an occasion upon which the late
Vice-President behaved with an eccentricity and spoke with an
incoherence not clearly traceable to his well-known temperance
principles. Anecdotes are related illustrative of Mr. Johnson's
sagacity, determination, and fine feeling, especially with respect to
his antecedents; and the little volume is decidedly
readable....</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the morning of the 16th inst.</p>
<p>A delegation of prominent citizens representing the nine Southern
States have had an interview with President Johnson, to affirm their
allegiance to the Constitution and the Union, and to express
confidence in the President's policy towards the South. Mr. Johnson,
in replying to the sentiments expressed by the delegation, said he was
glad to see the Southern people, after submitting the question of
secession to the arbitrament of the sword, and having lost the cause,
now frankly admitted their defeat, and were willing to become good
citizens. The Government would do all in their power to restore civil
authority in the South, and he hoped to see them again fully enjoying
their old position in the Union. The Government had no disposition to
deal harshly with the South, notwithstanding the speeches published in
various quarters breathing a different spirit. Though dreading
disintegration, he strongly opposed consolidation. The delegation
thanked the President for the generous and magnanimous expression of
his kindly feeling towards the South.</p>
<p>It is reported that all troops, except for garrison duty, are to be
withdrawn from the South. The conflict between the military and civil
authorities in South Carolina had been amicably arranged.</p>
<p>Conventions for revisions of the constitution of Alabama and South
Carolina assembled at Montgomery and Columbia, the respective capitals
of those States, on the 12th and 13th inst. No important proceedings
have yet been reported. At a meeting of the citizens of Austin,
Grimes, and Washington Counties, Texas, recently held at Hempstead,
it was resolved to co-operate with President Johnson in his system of
restoration, and Provisional Governor Hamilton was solicited to
appoint an early day for a revision of the State Constitution.</p>
<p>The <sic>Massachusett's</sic> Republic Convention was held at Worcester, on the
14th inst. Colonel Alexander Bullock was nominated for Governor, and
the Hon. William Chaplin for Lieutenant-Governor. Resolutions
expressing confidence in President Johnson and pledging the State to
support his reconstruction policy were adopted. The Convention
considered the Southern leaders should suffer condign punishment, but
recommended pardoning the Southern people. Senator Sumner made a
speech in which he stated that neither the rebellion nor slavery was
ended, nor would be, until the negroes were placed upon a full
equality with the whites before the law.</p>
<p>A banquet was given, on the 9th ult., in Meadville, Pennsylvania,
on the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, to the English
capitalists, Sir Morton Peto, Mr. James M'Henry, Mr. Brassey, and
suite, who are on a tour of inspection of the public works and other
enterprises of Canada and America.</p>
<p>Three whaling-vessels--one of them having on board 150 sailors from
vessels destroyed by the Shenandoah--arrived at Honolulu, Sandwich
Islands, on Aug. 16. They report the total number of captures by the
Shenandoah at thirty vessels, twenty-six of which were burnt and
bonded.</p></div2>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> gives the following
account of the narrow escape at Niagara of Professor Ruggles, of
Dartmouth College:--"While walking on Goat Island with a party of
ladies, one of them dropped her parasol, which slid some 15 ft. or 20
ft. down the bank of the river. Mr. Ruggles went down and picked it
up, but on attempting to return, the bank being steep and the ground
hard, lost his footing and fell down to the very brink of the
precipice, which at this point is 80 ft. or 90 ft. high; here he
caught hold of the roots of an upturned tree, the trunk of which hangs
over the abyss. The shock caused the tree to shake violently, and it
appeared on the point of falling over the precipice. The ladies
shrieked and called for help, but no assistance was at hand. A
movement on the part of Mr. Ruggles or a gust of wind seemed
sufficient to cause the tree to fall. At this critical moment one of
the ladies took off her basquine and skirt, cut them into strips, got
shawls and other articles of clothing from the rest of the party, tied
them together, fastened a stone to the rope thus formed, and let it
down to Mr. Ruggles, who, taking hold of it, walked slowly up the
bank. It was a moment of fearful suspense. The rope was held firmly by
the ladies above, but it might untie or break, and a fall of 100
ft. on the rocks below must be the inevitable result. When Mr. Ruggles
reached terra firma his fair rescuer, who had shown such remarkable
presence of mind, fainted, and was taken home in an unconscious
state.</p></div2>

Saturday, September</hi> 30, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Perrault</hi> speaks of certain unhappy
illustrations as "comparisons with long tails." Probably a comparison
more caudally gifted than one which has just been published, with the
honoured name of the late Mr. Cobden annexed to it, has scarcely been
penned since Perrault wrote. In alluding to the affairs of Mexico and
French intervention in that region, Mr. Cobden says that we ought to
consider how France would feel if the United States were suddenly, and
without consulting her, to erect a republic in Belgium. Even our
respect for the memory of an able and good man, too soon lost to us,
can hardly induce us to treat such an argument gravely, or to admit
that it has the slightest value in enabling us to estimate the
facts. The most that can be said in justification of so feeble a
suggestion is, that Mr. Cobden was endeavouring to touch a Frenchman
on his weak point--national pride; but the recipient of the letter
must have smiled at the rather helpless effort.</p>
<p>It might have been better had one whose words deservedly commanded
respectful attention in America called the attention of the
Republicans to one circumstance which might be thought to merit
consideration from any people possessed of ordinary good feeling, not
to say of a sense of decency. The Americans might, indeed, without
Mr. Cobden's reminder, have recollected that annexation, to adopt the
polite word, was practised by them upon Mexico, on a very large scale,
and not twenty years ago. Some of us here, who are troubled with
memories, can easily recall the revolt of Texas, which had previously
and by system been filled with adventurers from the United States, and
the absorption, a few years later, of that province by the Northern
Republic. But everyone remembers how the long-sought war with Mexico
broke out, and how it terminated in 1848, when this Mexico, over whose
interests the Union now desires to watch so tenderly, was compelled to
give up nearly 600,000 square miles of territory to the Stripes and
Stars, whereby New Mexico, Upper California, and a large tract of
country east of the Rio Grand del Norte, became American. We are not
inclined to say that it was not a good thing for these districts that
they came into the possession of a civilised Power, and law and order
took the place of robbery and jobbery. We believe that no change could
have occurred in the condition of any part of Mexico, for the last
half century, that would not have been an improvement. Our American
cousins have greatly benefited the territories which they acquired in
this highhanded manner. But, considering that the plots to obtain them
were just as deliberately planned as the conspiracy of European rulers
against Poland, that the Mexican plunder was gained just as the Polish
plunder was gained, and with quite as little real title on the part of
the spoliators, we must be allowed to think that in any new effort for
the civilisation of Mexico the Republic might discover what a
Frenchman calls a splendid opportunity of holding its tongue. The
Americans, however, have many virtues and merits, but nobody is in the
habit of including among them the tame quality called good taste.</p>
<p>Mr. Cobden says, rather dogmatically, that no human power can
restore Mexico to order, or bestow on it the blessings of civilised
progress. This double proposition is strong, and we may be forgiven
for thinking that it is rather too strong. We have no reason to
believe that a military Government, for instance, or a Government,
like that of France, which wraps up its bayonet in the stamped paper
of legality, could not at all events enforce order in Mexico by the
same stringent process which has been employed by France
elsewhere. Mexico is a large country; but its population is not very
great, and in all probability does not exceed the amount of that of
Ireland some years ago. The Census of 1850 gave the number at about
seven millions and a half, over an area of about 800,000 English
square miles. Making all allowance for the extraordinary difficulties
offered by the character of portions of the country to military
operations, it is idle to say that France, in earnest at the work,
could not enforce order for all material purposes in a region like
this, leaving moral agencies to exert themselves afterwards. It might
be safely affirmed, in speculation, even if the brief history of the
Maximilian dynasty had not proved the fact, that in the large towns,
and in the better portion of the country districts, there must exist a
hearty desire, not for the success of this or that army, but for a
system under which men's lives, freedom, and purses should be safe. A
government of order has already obtained the support of the best
classes, weary of the constant struggles of adventurers and of the
unhappy condition into which those were thrown who had aught to
lose. The country has always been in a transition state, and this is
only another word for a demoralisation, at which the patriotic Mexican
must sicken. We do not think that it is too much to say that the class
in which the true element of strength resides is at heart in favour of
the Empire, and with the support of that class we do not see the
impossibility of what Mr. Cobden declares to be impossible--namely,
the establishment of order, at the very least.</p>
<p>For nearly forty years the condition of Mexico has been more
unfavourable than that of any country on the globe. The attempt at a
Constitution was a failure from several causes, the chief, perhaps,
being the effort to combine Old and New World institutions and the
difficulty of making these work harmoniously. But the want of
character and conscience in the statesmen and leaders of the country
would have prevented any system from working for the benefit of the
people. Intrigue followed upon intrigue, and the victor of the day
sought only the advantage of himself and his partisans, while the
defeated faction, instead of accepting the new state of things,
instantly set to organising plots for fresh attempts at dominion. It
was no wonder that the United States, eager for accession of
territory, soon spied the nakedness of the land, and marked out a prey
on which they pounced with more celerity than dignity. The
dictatorship of three years was disastrous, and the clergy, who are
among the most troublesome specimens of the priesthood, were never
fairly taken in hand and taught their true place by any Government
that has yet essayed to administer Mexican affairs. Central and
Federal Republicanism have been alike tried, but in vain, and the
condition of Mexico at length became a scandal and<pb n="307"/>
an outrage to the world. Whether the United States might not have
interfered more advantageously than a European Power could do may have
been a question; but it is one no longer; the Northern Republic had
its own affairs to attend to, and France, having cleverly sought but
signally failed to enlist England and Spain in the business, has
undertaken the settlement of Mexico. The wishes of all lovers of order
went with the experiment, not because they admired the exertion of
force, but because the settlement was a necessity, and Mexico had been
showing for years that she was unable to effect it. We cannot see that
the right course has not been taken; and, at all events, the course is
up to the present moment successful. The rebels have been defeated,
their leader has fled, and the last news is that the Republic of
Mexico has ceased to exist. In spite of Mr. Cobden's conviction,
therefore, order is in a fair way to be established in Mexico, and we
desire to believe that moral progress also is at no distant date to
commence.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...You have all heard of the St. Albans raid--of the impudent
exploit of the Southern filibusters under Bennett Young, who passed
over from Canada, plundered all the banks, stole all the horses in
St. Albans, and shot a livery-stable keeper. Not far from St. Albans,
in the State of Vermont, is a place called Burlington. Here there has
just taken place a "raid" rivalling in turpitude and impudence the
famous deed of Bennett Young. A citizen of Burlington has just eloped
with no less than three married ladies, and "made tracks" to
Canada. One of the injured husbands has started in hot pursuit of this
"gallant, gay Lothario" in triplicate. The other two, wiser, remain at
home. I am sorry to hear this about Burlington; for the affair
reflects grievously on the State of Vermont, which is a very moral
State, and has adopted the Maine liquor law. It is only in the western
and "wild cat" part of the Union that you expect to hear of
matrimonial eccentricities. If you will only reside, for instance, six
months in the State of Indiana you may obtain, at the expense of a few
dollars, a divorce on almost any kind of plea. "Incompatibility of
temper" is a serious ground for divorce there. There are "divorce
lawyers" in the Atlantic cities who make up periodical
excursion-trains of clients to the capital of the "untying State." You
may often see an advertisement couched in this fashion:--"I start for
Indianopolis on the 1st proximo. Couples wishing to join (i.e., to be
disjoined) will please communicate at once to 'Alpha,' 302, West Old
Hundredth-street, N. Y."</p>
<p>Mention of the naughty man of Vermont leads me naturally to the
recently-published volume of "Artemus Ward Among the Mormons," to
which is prefixed a very graphic and sensible introduction by
Mr. E. P. Hingston, who was Artemus's companion during his journey
from California to Great Salt Lake City and thence north
again. Skimming over those pleasant pages, I have discovered that the
choral nuisance, the intolerably coarse and stupid "comic" song of
"Jolly Dogs," with its meaningless refrain of "Slap, bang! here we are
again!" which has been yelled at music-halls and ground on street
organs innumerable, has, after all, a Yankee origin. Mr. Hingston
heard it sung, nearly three years since, in a stage-coach in Utah by
three "saints"--a Mormon bishop, Brigham Young's son-in-law, and the
manager of the Great Salt Lake City theatre. The chorus to the
American edition is "Rip, slap! set him up again!" There is nothing
new under the sun....</p></div2>

Katskill mountains, and drinks their magic liquor, causing him a sleep

<p>The work of reconstruction in the South is proceeding
satisfactorily, and President Johnson's policy is meeting with
approval. The New York Republican State Convention has passed
resolutions expressing confidence in him, approving his reconstruction
policy, and pledging him its hearty support. The Wisconsin Democratic
Convention have also indorsed the President's policy and tendered him
their support.</p>
<p>The Alabama State Convention has requested the Governor to call out
the militia for the purpose of repressing the disorder and lawlessness
prevailing in several counties. Resolutions have been introduced into
the Reconstruction Convention repudiating the Rebel State Debt, and
declaring it the duty of the Convention to restore the State to her
proper relations with the Federal Government, and that it was not
expedient to change the State Constitution until next session of the
Convention except to repeal the secession ordinance, and other
ordinances consequent upon the same. They also acknowledge the
abolition of slavery, and prohibit its restoration, declaring the
slaves shall be protected and cared for. The resolutions also ratified
the State enactments subsequent to secession not inconsistent with the
Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>The message of Governor Perry, of South Carolina, is a remarkable
document. Although he opposes negro suffrage, he urges kindness
towards the freedmen, and the ratification by the Convention of the
Constitutional clause abolishing slavery.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson has appointed Mr. James Wells Provisional Governor of
Louisiana, in order to reconstruct the State after the manner of other
Southern States.</p>
<p>The official correspondence between Messrs. Seward and Adams, in
March and August of the present year, in reference to the Confederate
loan, and Vice-<sic>Chancellor's</sic> Stuart's decision in the Priolean case,
has been published. Mr. Seward instructs Mr. Adams that he may, if
necessary, inform the British Government, in a friendly and courteous
manner, that the United States never admitted the combination of
rebels to be a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government, and will not
be responsible for the rebel debt, and will insist on their claim for
the restoration of cotton in the present case. While they are content
to receive it through a decree of the British tribunals, they insist
on their absolute right to it through the action of the British
Government. The United States will hold themselves under no obligation
whatever to accept or to conform their proceedings to conditions which
the Court of Chancery or other municipal court may prescribe in the
present or other litigation.</p>
<p>Sir Morton Peto, the Hon. Arthur Kinnaird, and the other Englishmen
(spoken of generally as the English capitalists), who have been
travelling through the western States, have created a sensation. Their
movements are chronicled by the telegraph, and they are followed by a
number of correspondents, who dispatch long letters to the journals
describing the dinners, balls, and f&#x00EA;tes got up in honour of
these tourists. As on all occasions they make speeches illustrative of
good feeling and kindness between the two countries, their trip has
assumed great political importance, and leading articles are written
praising the remarks of the English speakers and applauding their
repeated assertions that between England and the United States there
should exist a true and sincere alliance.</p></div2>

<p>...What a mean and ungentlemanly act, to say the very least, is
that of Mr. Seward in raking up a more or less apocryphal list of
Confederate bondholders in England, and seeking to invest it with the
dignity of a State paper. It is the act not of a statesman but of a
"cad." What has Mr. Seward, or anyone else, to do with the manner in
which gentlemen choose to invest their money? Surely one has a right
to back his opinion if he likes, even if, as sometimes happens, he
backs the wrong horse. Just imagine Earl Russell publishing a list of
the American Cabinet Ministers and Congress men who have made
libellous speeches against England! Moreover, this wretched little bit
of spite has not even the merit of novelty. It was first published in

success, so far as the sinking of the Terpsichore was concerned. The
Terpsichore is an old 18-gun ship. She was selected to put the
torpedoes to the test. She was moored in Gillingham Reach, and a
torpedo was placed beneath her. After a good deal of preparation, the
torpedo was exploded, as usual, by means of the electric current. The
shock to the ship was very violent; she seemed to be lifted out of the
water somewhat, and her upper deck to be forced upward, where the
explosion took full effect; she also reeled under the shock. A large
hole must have been made in her bottom, for she began rapidly to
fill, going down by the head; and in two minutes and a half she had
settled down as far as she could sink.</p></div2>

<p>A number of the Fenian conspirators were taken, on Saturday last,
before Mr. Stronge, one of the Dublin police magistrates. Mr. Barry
prosecuted for the Crown, and stated the case. According to his
opening, the designs of the Fenians were bloody-minded enough. They
intended a general massacre of the aristocracy, the clergy, both
Romish and Protestant, and generally of all above their own class; the
land to be divided amongst themselves. Considerable sums of money had
been received by the leaders of the movement from America; and the
secret manufacture of arms would also, he said, be proved. Stephens,
who had escaped, was at the head of the movement. The informer is a
man named Nagle. The examination of the prisoners was resumed on
Monday, and, after the production of some more witnesses and the reading of documents, Luby,
O'Leary, O'Connor, O'Donovan, and O'Keeffe were committed to take
their trial on a charge of high treason. Hopper, who was regarded as
the financial agent of the brotherhood, was remanded till Monday
next. All the prisoners were anxious to repudiate the charge of
intended wholesale assassination. Two more arrests have been made in
Cork and several in Ulster. At Kingstown, on Monday, a man named
Patrick Gaffney was charged with having torn down part of a
proclamation offering a reward for the apprehension of Stephens, the
Fenian leader. Several districts in the counties of Tipperary,
Waterford, and Limerick have been "proclaimed" under the Peace
Preservation Act of 1856.</p></div2>

against foreign Governments, including claims for compensation for the
depredations of the Alabama and other Confederate cruisers and of
Confederate "raiders" from Canada, are to be sent to the State
Department, in order that they may be preferred for settlement.</p>
<p>The Alabama Convention has repudiated the whole Confederate

<p>The South Carolina Convention had passed resolutions embodying the

Saturday, October</hi> 14, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Diplomacy</hi> is now "on its trial." It has a
difficult and delicate task to perform, but the call is peremptory,
and the object noble. If diplomacy should now fail, it will be
discredited for ever, and we shall not be disinclined to listen to
those who declare it an effete conventionalism which should be
discarded by enlightened nations. We, however, hope better things from
the accomplished masters of the art who have been for some months
exchanging despatches in secret, and whose efforts have this week been
laid before the world. Diplomacy has to preserve the peace between the
two great nations, England and the United States.</p>
<p>Five despatches have just been published. They form a
correspondence between the representative of America, Mr. Adams, and
our Foreign Secretary. The first is dated the 7th of April, the last
is not a month old. We therefore have before us the dispute as it
stands. It may be convenient to add here that Earl Russell, refusing
the demands of Mr. Adams, has made a proposition which the latter has
undertaken to refer to his Government, but which it is, apparently,
unlikely that he will be instructed to accept. The reply to this will
be the next diplomatic news from America.</p>
<p>The requisition of the United States, of course, takes no one by
surprise, as we have been for a long time informed, by more
trustworthy organs than the generally-demoralised press of the States,
that Mr. Seward would insist upon compensation to such American
citizens as have suffered by the ravages committed on Federal property
by vessels of British origin. The demand is now solemnly made, and as
seriously met. Mr. Adams, in April, called the attention of Earl
Russell to the official reports which the American Government had
received upon the subject, and, while giving our own Government credit
for a desire to prevent the ravages complained of and to act in a
friendly manner towards America, Mr. Adams endeavoured to fix upon us
as a nation responsibility for the acts of the vessels in question. He
pointed out that the sea was swept of United States commerce, to the
advantage of this country, and he thus by implication assigned a
selfish character to the conduct of our Administration. He further
asserted that the system took its rise in the precipitate action of
England in hastening to invest with the character of belligerents
those who had not when so proclaimed a single vessel of their own to
show floating. British harbours had been open to the Confederate
vessels, which had been sheltered and assisted there, and had been
received with an unmistakable sympathy. We are charged in express
terms with having not only given birth to the Confederate naval
belligerent but with having nursed and maintained it to the present
hour. Mr. Adams having, as was his duty, made out the strongest case
in his power, protested against the conduct of England and demanded
the immediate withdrawal of belligerent rights from the rebels.</p>
<p>After due consideration, Earl Russell replies nearly a month
afterwards. He asserts that England has done its duty, and has
faithfully obeyed both international and municipal law. In reference
to the alleged advantage gained to us by the acts of the Confederates,
the Foreign Secretary points out the fearful losses entailed upon us
by the war, which shut up from us the provinces which supplied the
material of an enormous trade. The constituting the rebels
belligerents was the act of the President of the States, not ours. He
proclaimed a blockade, which he could do only on the ground that the
South was waging war with him. We could do but one of two
things--acknowledge the blockade, and, by consequence, the
belligerency, or refuse to acknowledge it, and go on trading. The
latter would have been an act of hostility towards the States. We had,
of course, a right to be neutral; but had we done as the Americans
desired, and treated the South as pirates, we should have ceased in
the most signal manner to be neutral; for we should have become active
agents in the war. Having argued out this question--and it will be
perceived that no argument had been introduced into the discussion
which had not been exhausted in the English journals--Earl Russell
proceeds to show that in regard to her dealings with the Confederate
vessels we did all that the law enjoins or permits. The Alabama was
stolen from us under a false pretence. Mr. Adams declares that the
harbour officers were all actuated by secret sympathy with the South,
and that they would do nothing to assist his efforts; but, whether
this be true or not, it is impossible to rest a case against an
honourable Government on the belief that its inferior agents were
unfaithful. Earl Russell, however, makes a fair point of a strong
expression of Mr. Seward's satisfaction at the just and friendly
proceedings of the English Government in regard to the vessels. He
then cites history, and brings a valuable precedent forward. The
United States had refused compensation to Spain and Portugal for
losses which their merchants sustained from vessels fitted out in
American harbours when the States were at peace with those nations;
and Mr. Adams himself, then Secretary of State, declared that, when a
Government had done all in its power to prevent the fitting out of
hostile cruisers against a friendly country, it was not bound to make
individual indemnification. In the case of the rams at Birkenhead,
Government acted so decidedly as to be accused in Parliament of having
gone beyond its powers.</p>
<p>In rather more than a fortnight the representative of America
returns to the charge, and re-states his case in a wider manner. It is
not necessary to analyse his replies to Earl Russell, or his attempts
to show that we did not, as asserted, faithfully perform our duties
with regard to the vessels which escaped. Suffice it to say that
Mr. Adams, after three months more, is very fully met by Earl Russell,
who seeks to show that we had not only acted with perfect
faithfulness, but had precisely copied the conduct of the Americans
under similar circumstances, He then refers to Mr. Adams's
proposition, made in October, 1863, that arbitration between the
countries should be resorted to. Earl Russell absolutely declines
this. "The Government of England are sole guardians of their own
honour." They will not admit that they have acted wrongly. Their law
officers mast understand our laws better than a foreign Government can
do. They will make neither reparation nor compensation for anything
done by the Alabama, nor will they refer the question. But they will
assent to the appointment of a commission to which shall be referred
all claims arising out of the war which claims the two Powers shall
agree so to refer.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams writes again on the 18th of last month, reiterates his
charges in stronger language, says that he will await further
instructions, and begs that he may not be thought to imply that the
English Government has made a proposal in the knowledge that it could
not be accepted, He adds, in reply to Earl Russell's assurance that
the efforts by which America has shaken off slavery have the warm
sympathies of this country, that he is glad to receive such
assurance, but is painfully convinced that a large and influential class here
have shown great coldness and apathy towards America. And here the
correspondence terminates. It is of a grave character; but diplomacy,
as we have said, is on its trial, and is bound to see the two great
nations, to whom quarrel would be as loathsome as mischievous, through
the difficulty. We hear that an English war ship is chasing the
Shenandoah, which has been mercilessly destroying the poor
whalers. The capture and hanging of her pirate crew would much smooth
the diplomatists' work.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">EXPERIMENTS <hi rend="smallcaps">With The
American<lb/>Torpedo-Shells At Chatham.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> first use of submarine explosive
shells for the destruction of hostile ships of war is attributed by
the Americans to Mr. David Bushnell, of Connecticut, who, about 1777,
contrived a machine in which the operator, with air enough to breathe
for half an hour, could dive under the bottom of an enemy's vessel,
and fasten to it a box of powder, which was afterwards to be fired by
means of a gunlock and a long cord. This machine, which took its name
from its shape resembling the American turtle or torpedo, was tried
without success against the British squadron in New York harbour and
in the Delaware. Twenty years later Robert Fulton, the author of steam
navigation in America, devised a method of applying submarine
bomb-shells, which he laid before the British Government. It was
discountenanced by our naval authorities, but found some favour with
Mr. Pitt, who on one occasion witnessed near Walmer Castle the blowing
up of the brig Dorothea by means of a 180-pounder torpedo--that is, an
explosive shell, the name being now transferred from the original
diving-machine to the immediate instrument of destruction. Fulton's
shell was provided with clock-work to set the gunlock in action and
fire the powder, after the lapse of a given time.  The whole subject,
however, seems to have lain in abeyance till the Russian war of 1854,
when the channels leading to Cronstadt were defended by sunken
magazines of powder, held by buoys at a certain depth beneath the
surface; the intended method of ignition, when the enemy's ships
passed over, was by the breaking of a small glass tube, containing
sulphuric acid, which would then flow down a long flexible tube,
containing at its bottom a preparation of chlorate of potash, so as to
produce a flame communicating with the magazine. These Russian
torpedos, however, did not prove very efficient, and were harmlessly
fished up by our exploring boats.</p>
<p>The late civil war in America has occasioned the practical
application and modification of these engines of warfare in a great
variety of forms. They were extensively used by the military and naval
engineers of the Southern Confederacy, the most successful example
being shown by the destruction of the Tecumseh, at Mobile, in August,
1863. A torpedo diving-boat, with steam-engine and screw-propeller,
and with two vanes, like the fins of a fish, to regulate its upward or
downward motion, was constructed by them at Charleston, and another at
New Orleans; but in these instances the torpedo-shells, as employed by
the Southerners, were to be thrust forward at the end of a long arm or
spar, so as to be placed in direct contact with the bottom or side of
the ship to destroyed.</p>
<p>This principle, which seemed fatal to the usefulness and convenient
applicability of the invention, has been entirely superseded by the
new kind of torpedos exhibited last week at Chatham. The merit of the
novel combination, in its present shape, is shared by Mr. W. W. Wood,
Chief Engineer of the United States Navy, and Mr. G. W. Beardslee, of
New York, inventor of the magneto-electric telegraph, which had
already been employed with remarkable success for military and
engineering purposes on land. Without going into a description of
Mr. Beardslee's invention, which supersedes the galvanic battery as
well for the transmission of messages as for the explosion of mines or
magazines, at any distance, either on land or under water, and sunk at
any depth, it may be stated that the magneto-electric apparatus,
requiring no acids or plates, is carried in a small box, as portable
as a writing-desk; it may be worked very easily upon an open telegraph
wire on land, or a wire, in the water, insulated by a coating of
vulcanised india-rubber. In August, 1864, when Mr. Beardslee's
apparatus was experimentally applied to the ordinary line of telegraph
wire between New York and Washington, a charge of gunpowder at
Washington was fired in an instant by the operators at New York,
and<pb n="357"/> <hi rend="italic">vice vers&#x00E1;</hi>, at a
distance, of 240 miles; whereas in former experiments of this sort
with Grove's galvanic batteries, the combined power of no less than
150 pairs was required to ignite powder by means of burning a platinum
wire, at Baltimore, forty miles from Washington. Mr. Beardslee employs
a patent fusee or cartridge, for mines and torpedoes, which is so
ingenious that we must give it particular notice. It consists of a
small wooden cylinder, about three quarters of an inch in diameter,
and 3 in. long; at one end of the cylinder is a cavity which holds the
combustible, which is confined only by pasteboard or membrane, so
that, when ignited, it will blow straight into the heart of the
principal charge; the two wires of the electric circuit, entering at
the other end of the cylinder, terminate upon the little wooden disc
which forms the bottom of this cavity, so that the end of one wire is
about a quarter of an inch from the other; the electric circuit is
completed by drawing a dash with a blacklead-pencil across the tiny
space of the wooden surface connecting the two ends of wire; and the
fusee is then charged. It is a property of blacklead or plumbago to
burst into flame when reached by the electric current; hence, by
sending a current through the circuit thus composed, which may have
wires of any length, the pencil-mark lying in the track of this
current, and consisting of a few disintegrated particles of plumbago,
is infallibly set on fire, and must infallibly set fire to the whole
charge of the fuses, and of the torpedo or mine. The use of such a
fusee is in every way superior to the method of producing ignition by
platinum wire, which involves a great waste of electric
power. Torpedos have been exploded by this fuse at a depth of 500
ft. or 600 ft. under water, in the oil-wells of Pennsylvania. At the
Military Academy, West Point., in January last, an 11-inch shell, at
the depth of 170 ft. beneath the ice of the Hudson, was exploded
through five miles of wire. By other explosions, at a depth of 20 ft.,
the ice was torn up in an extraordinary manner. At the same place,
when further experiments were made last April, sixty shells of that
size, arranged in three groups or circuits, were exploded at the
same instant of time. The utility of this process for submarine
engineering was shown, in February, 1864, by the speedy removal of the
massive piles which the Southerners had placed to obstruct the
entrance of Elizabeth River, near Norfolk, Virginia; three discharges,
at intervals of half an hour, clearing away ten clusters of piles,
chained together, and driven 15 ft. deep into the bed of the river,
the depth of water being 30 ft.</p>
<p>The exhibition which took place in the Medway, on Wednesday week, in
the presence of the Duke of Somerset, First Lord of the Admiralty;
Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Talbot, commanding the squadron at the Nore;
Captain Stewart, the superintendent of Chatham dockyard; Sir Robert
Walpole, commandant of the garrison; Colonel Boxer, and other
professional or scientific gentlemen, fully maintained the reputation
of the American torpedos. The official party was accompanied on board
the Admiralty yacht Wildfire by Mr. Donald M'Kay, the extensive
shipowner, of Boston, who has undertaken to help in introducing the
contrivance of Messrs. Wood and Beardslee to the Governments and
public of Europe. Mr. Beardslee himself had been busied for a week
before in making his preparations at Chatham; and on the Saturday
previous to this exhibition he had sunk a torpedo charged with 440
lb. of powder in the mud and sand off Gillingham Point, at the
entrance to Chatham Harbour. The depth of water at high tide was 26
ft., and the place was marked by a pole bearing a red flag, the wire
attached to the torpedo being kept by a float on the surface. The
Admiralty yacht having taken up her station a few hundred yards from
the barge on which Mr. Beardslee and his assistants were stationed
with their electrical apparatus for igniting the shells, the signal
was given for commencing. A boat's crew was dispatched from the
operator's barge to establish electrical communication with the sunken
shell, which was to be fired through a length of two miles of
wire. This preliminary completed and the train all ready for firing,
in an instant there rose from the placid bosom of the river high into
the air a huge column of water, in shape and action much resembling
those great waterspouts occasionally witnessed by sailors in
mid-ocean, and to which, though very beautiful to look upon, they do
their best to give a wide berth. The splendid volumes of snow-white
feathery spray soared quickly to a height of little less than 200 ft.,
and then fell gently again in exquisitely graceful curves into the
vortex whence they had risen, leaving no trace of themselves behind,
save a slowly-expanding circle of bubbling, foaming water, the muddy,
yeasty aspect of which showed that the river had been stirred to its
lowest depths....The explosion of the next torpedo--also a
440-pounder, but suspended 2 ft. below the surface--produced effects
but slightly differing from those just described, except that it was
accompanied by a more deafening report, while fragments of the
cylinder were sent spinning high above the topmost wreaths of
delicate, feathery spray, and the rare beauty of the too-transient
display was more strongly contrasted with the after turbidness of the
seething waters. Several other experiments of a similar nature
followed, the third torpedo, a 440-pounder, being suspended 15
ft. below the surface; and the fourth, of the same size and charge,
suspended in 30 ft. of water, instead of resting on the bottom. They
were fired through wires one third of a mile in length. The last of
the 440-pounders lifted an enormous mass of water, which seemed as if
scooped out of a hollow 100 ft. in diameter and hurled into the air to
a height of little less than 200ft., with an effect which was awfully
grand.</p>
<p>Preparations were now made for destroying the Terpsichore, 18-gun
sailing-frigate, which had been placed at the disposal of
Mr. Beardslee by the Admiralty in order to put the destructive powers
of the torpedo to the most practical test. Although a torpedo charged
with only 50 lb. of powder would, according to Mr. Beardslee's
statement, be more than sufficient to destroy a vessel of the size of
the Terpsichore, he had proposed, with a view of obtaining the fullest
possible effects, to use a full charge of 440 lb. in the
torpedo--sufficient, it may be remarked, to destroy the largest vessel
in the British Navy. It was, however, considered that so tremendous a
force brought to bear on so comparatively small an object would be
attended with results not contemplated; and accordingly a couple of 75
lb. torpedoes were taken, in the small boat, close alongside the
Terpsichore and there sunk, being just let down from the side of the
boat. As the tide was running very strong, but one of the two
torpedoes lodged at its proper place, so as to have the ship within
reach of the explosion; the other, being carried aside as much as 10
ft. or 12 ft., could have no material effect. The boat with
Mr. Beardslee and his men drew off a short distance; then, after a
momentary pause, came the stifled report of both the torpedos at once,
and the Terpsichore suddenly rose at her bows 10 ft. or 12 ft. into
the air and heeled over on her starboard side, while great masses of
water burst up through her decks, her whole frame being convulsed and
heaving as with agony, till she began to settle down [f]orwards. In
another moment her stern stood up at an acute angle, and her bow sank
deeper and deeper. Not a fragment, however, of her timbers was seen to
be detached from the rest of her bulk, not a splinter had been shot up
into the air or had fallen off into the water, and she appeared to be
going down bodily. The mischief she had received would seem to be a
broken back; for she still continued to go down by the head, until, in
about five minutes from her first movement, she lay fast aground in
the Medway mud on an even keel, with the tide, now at three-quarters
ebb, up to within a few inches of her portholes. There was not then
enough water entirely to cover her. She was left there till last
Monday, when the wreck was lifted and hauled into dock at Chatham. On
Tuesday morning the water was pumped out of the dock, and the frigate
having in the mean time been shored up, the whole of her hull was
exposed to view, allowing a careful examination to be made of her
bottom by the dockyard officials. The injuries effected by the torpedo
are all on the starboard side of the hull, slightly abaft the fore
chains, the port side of the bottom showing no injury whatever, with
the exception of the loosening of a few of the sheets of copper. The
full explosive force of the torpedo appears to have caught the frigate
about 8 ft. upward from her keel, blowing in her timbers and planking,
the opening thus effected being about 10 ft. square. A close
examination shows that few of the timbers are broken off, the
separation being at their points of junction. Proceeding on board the
frigate, the effects of the explosion are still more apparent, the
planking of the main deck for a length of above 20 ft. being ripped
up, while the deck beams are broken in various directions and forced
upwards to the upper deck. Even had the explosion not sunk her, the
tremendous shock she sustained would have rendered her useless, while
some idea of the effects of the shock may be formed from the
circumstance of the whole of the iron knees on the port side, which
carry the upper-deck beams, being wrenched and broken off. The frigate
has been inspected this week by a large number of persons, including
several of the officers of the Royal Engineers.</p></div2>

<p>The Government officials at Liverpool have completed the return of
the emigration from that port for the past quarter. During the month
of September last thirty-eight ships sailed under the provisions of
the Passenger Act, carrying out in all 13,853 passengers. Of this
number 11,455 went to the United States. The nationalities of these
were as follow:--2408 English, 223 Scotch, 4534 Irish, and 2878
foreigners. To Canada there were five ships and 1474 passengers. In
the steerage there were 663 English, 38 Scotch, 330 Irish, and 214
foreigners. There was one ship to New South Wales, with 441
passengers, of which 55 were English, 80 Scotch, and 357 Irish. To
Queensland there were two ships, with 551 passengers, of whom 145 were
English, 51 Scotch, and 355 Irish. To Victoria there were two ships,
with 37 cabin and 696 steerage passengers; of the latter 300 were
English, 51 were Scotch, 336 Irish, and 9 foreigners. This shows a
total of 907 cabin and 12,946 steerage passengers. The "short ships,"
which sailed, for the month, number nineteen in all, and they carried
646 passengers: making a grand total of 14,499. The returns for the
quarter show a considerable increase as compared with the previous
quarters of this year. In the quarter ending September last the total
number of passengers who sailed under the Act was 39,249, while for
the corresponding quarter of last year there were only 27,496
passengers, showing an increase for the quarter just ended of
11,753.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">FRANCE AND MEXICO.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whatever</hi> character the messages from
Washington to Paris upon the subject of Mexico may have assumed, and
whether they are of recent date or were dispatched at the time when
the conclusion of the internecine war gave the United States
Government an opportunity of looking round them, there is no doubt
that the President, in signifying his displeasure with French
interference on the new continent, expresses the feelings of a very
large, if not a very intellectual, portion of the American people. It
is not, therefore, of the first consequence to be assured as to the
exact accuracy of the statement which has just caused considerable
sensation in London and Paris--namely, that the President of the
States has decided on forbidding the Emperor of the French to dispatch
a fresh supply of troops to the aid of the Emperor Maxmilian. The
probability seems to be that the peremptory message of which we have
heard was rather inferred than known, and that we shall learn that, if
a very late despatch on the subject has been sent to Paris, the
document is not one of a character so offensive as that which has been
described. But this is of little consequence, for the reason we have
assigned. The Americans have managed to inoculate themselves with an
extraordinary conviction that the New World belongs to them, and that
Mr. Canning, of England, and Mr. Monroe, of Washington, have told them
so, and therefore they view with unconcealed jealousy any attempt at
intrusion on the part of Europeans. Whether, therefore, they may be
inclined to quarrel with France now on the subject of Mexico, or
whether they may be able to nurse their wrath to keep it warm until
the empire of Maximilian is able to stand by itself, and France may
withdraw, and not be quarrelled with at all, matters not very much. It
would, perhaps, be more to the advantage of the Maximilian dynasty
that hostilities should be provoked at once, while the honour of
France is involved, and her whole mighty force must be brought to the
aid of the new Emperor, than that his empire should be left to settle
itself, and that it should get into difficulties with the States at a
later date. Very good terms and a very good treaty could be obtained
from the latter Power at the present time; but later, <hi
rend="italic">v&#x00E6; victis!</hi> and who can say that ten years
hence France will be inclined to lend aid to the Mexican empire?</p>
<p>But, inasmuch as the hostility of the Americans to this Mexican
empire is a fact over which there is no getting, we may venture to
believe that, whether the President has sent the menacing despatch or
not, the belief represents the feelings of his constituents, and we
may be tolerably sure that at some convenient opportunity the States
will quarrel with Mexico. They did so before, as we recently pointed
out, and<pb n="374"/> the result was a war and an annexation. We will
not say what might be the end of a war in which the disciplined and
scientific armies of France would encounter the American forces. It is
possible that volunteers, even of the high class of which much of the
United States Army, now disbanded, was composed, might find a
different enemy in the splendid machine called a French army from the
gallant volunteers of the South. At the utmost, the Americans have had
but four years of military experience, while the French armies have an
unbroken succession of such knowledge. It might be that the Imperial
Marshals would be an overmatch for the Republican Generals. But,
withdraw France from the game, and it is not too much to say that
Grant, Sherman, or Sheridan would finish the business of the Emperor
Maximilian in a month. Unless France means to have a permanent
protectorate in Mexico, or unless good offices can bring the United
States Government to a recognition of the new monarchy, we may,
without any inclination to be prophets of ill, prognosticate that bad
fortune is in store for the Mexican empire. We shall have telegrams
for the second edition of the papers some fine afternoon, which
despatches will begin with the ominous words, "Rupture between the
States and Mexico." What the next will contain will depend very much
upon which of the dates is selected for the rupture in question.</p>
<p>Now, if the United States desire a new annexation, if they have
resolved that the stripes and stars shall float over the entire of the
southern part of North America, from Canada to Quibo, we can
understand the resolution, though we may not admire it. But there are
statesmen in the States. The vulgar longing for mere acquisition of
territory and addition of population, no doubt, actuates myriads among
them, and bids them regard Mexico as a territory to be taken when
circumstances may permit, or when any decent pretext can be afforded
for the annexation. The same objections which they affect to feel in
regard to a monarchical neighbour can easily be made to apply to a
democratic neighbour, if his democracy is not exactly like that of the
great Republic. There need never be wanting an excuse for seizing
Mexico while the Americans retain their present ideas as to their own
destiny, and as to the very frivolous and antiquated character of Old
World notions about right and wrong. These persons need be in no
hurry. But, as we have said, there are statesmen among them who must
be superior to the low feeling of avidity for mere annexation. They
want something more than so many additional millions of acres and
fellow-citizens. They would like to increase the Union, no doubt; but
they would like to feel that any increase was an advantage. Men of
this class must perceive that at the present time the absorption of
Mexico would be a premature step, a foolish blunder. In the anecdotage
of New York is a clever story illustrating the acuteness of a
hunter. He was tracking a deer, had marked it down, and had his finger
on the trigger of his rifle, when he noted a movement in the bush. The
next moment he perceived a hostile Indian who was intent on the same
game as himself. The savage did not see him, but took fatal aim at the
deer. The American transferred his aim from the animal's heart to that
of the Indian, waited calmly until the latter had fired the
death-shot, and then he drew his own trigger, thus securing his deer
and slaying his foe. The wiser men among the Northerners will perhaps
do well to take a hint from the wary hunter, at least to the extent of
letting their game be brought down by other hands than their own.</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Si sua bona n&#x00F4;rint</hi>, the Americans
would regard their Majesties the Emperors Napoleon and Maximilian as
pioneers, who are doing the best possible service to the States. If
the Austrian dynasty be allowed to survive, the States will obtain,
instead of the worst neighbours they could possibly have, reasonably
good and improving ones. Order and law mean commerce and artificial
wants, and these can only grow where a strong hand represses the
barbarous and disorderly in the sternest and most resolute manner. No
American can need to be told what sort of a chaos of wretchedness
Mexico has been for years. Each successive attempt to educe order from
it by means of the people has only shown more and more the
demoralisation of that people, and its entire unfitness for
self-government. When it has chosen or endured a leader, he has been
about as bad a man as could be found, even in Mexico, and any better
ruler has speedily lost the reins. Mexico has at length got the only
form of Government which can have any hope of success--the rule of the
bayonet. Force may achieve good, but it is certain that nothing else
can. If the Americans are wise, they will quietly permit
Canning-Monroe doctrines, as they have now chosen to call them (though
Canning would have been singularly sarcastic in his retort on anyone
who accused him of wishing to make Uncle Sam the king of the western
world), go to sleep in the pigeon-hole at the White House. They will
watch the exertions of the new Emperor, aided by his powerful friend,
to bring Mexico into order. Whether the latter uses Egyptians or not
for the purpose does not greatly signify. He used them some time ago,
and we ourselves made protest, not on Monroe grounds, but on the more
rational basis of international law, which does not permit subjects to
be taken away without leave from their suzerain. If the Emperor wants
more Egyptians he will doubtless, obtain them in a regular manner; and
we really suggest in sincerity to the Americans that they had better
let him do his work in his own way. Let him create for them an orderly
and commercial neighbour in Mexico. They cannot be afraid of the
influence of example, or that the kings of shoddy and of oil may be
inspired to desire a king and an aristocracy of their own. A German
Count is not likely to assume a very tempting aspect in the eyes of
Anglo-Saxons. We do not think that even Texas will be demoralised, and
so far abnegate the rights of man as to ask to be allowed to secede and
set up a Sovereign. But what will happen if the Maximilian dynasty
receives support from its great neighbour is that the finances of the
country will be taken out of the hands of thieves; the laws will be
enforced, and not left to be carried out by corrupt functionaries as
bad as the culprits who buy them; the Church will be prevented from
being, as heretofore, a lever for overthrowing Government; and the
honest people of Mexico will at length be delivered from the cruelty
and rapacity of the dishonest. Then, material prosperity will set in,
and the richly-favoured land will cease to be a scandal among
nations. When this shall have been effected, an American who really
believes in the principles he avows will see that a truly enlightened
Mexico must of her own accord seek for admission into the all-perfect
Republic. Surely such a future is better than a recurrence of anarchy
and bloodshed, which would be the result of the overthrow of the
Maximilian dynasty. The States which had caused its fall would be
bound to take Mexico in hand themselves, and we need hardly point out
to a Yankee that it is scarcely in accordance with his traditions to
do anything for himself at a great price which he can get another to
do for him for nothing. We think that this business-like view of the
whole case ought to commend itself to the American mind, and we are
not without hope that it has already done so, and than there is no
truth in the statement that Mr. Seward has sent an insulting message
to the benefactor of Mexico.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The most important news from the United States has reference to
France and Mexico. It was telegraphed that a Cabinet Council had been
held at Washington to take into consideration a report that France was
raising troops in Egypt for service in Mexico, and that the result had
been announced in a despatch of Mr. Seward to the French Government
declaring that the United States Government would not permit
additional troops to be sent to Mexico by France, and that any further
intervention might lead to a serious misunderstanding between the two
countries. The Moravian, however, which left New York on the 7th
inst., brings the official information that the United States
Government has taken no recent action, nor contemplates any,
inconsistent with absolute neutrality between the belligerents in
Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward and his son Frederick have left Washington for Auburn,
New York, on a visit, for ten days.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis has been removed from the casemates to other (we hope
better) quarters in Fort Monroe.</p>
<p>General Lee was formally inaugurated President of Washington
College, Lexington, Virginia, on the 2nd inst. The friendliest
feeling was shown.</p>
<p>Most of the State Conventions, which were engaged in the work of
framing new Constitutions, have resolved, while admitting the black
population to all other civil rights, that they shall not be admitted
to the franchise.</p>
<p>The North Carolina Convention, on the 6th inst., passed a
resolution declaring the secession ordinance null and void and calling
into life the original Constitution of the State.</p>
<p>The Mississippi State elections had passed off quietly, and
General Humphrey had been elected Governor, who had, it was said, been
pardoned by the President.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Democratic Convention have nominated J. M. Welis as
Governor. They have approved Mr. Johnson's reorganisation policy, and
have determined to exclude religious and sectional controversies, on
the ground that the Federal Government was made to be perpetuated for
the exclusive political benefit of the white race. The convention
urged that a constitutional convocation should be summoned, and
resolved to request Congress to grant compensation for the losses
caused by emancipation. Finally, the convention prayed the Government
for a general amnesty and a prompt restoration of property.</p>
<p>The following is the text of the abolition ordinance passed in the
Alabama Convention on the 22nd ult.:--"Be it ordained by the people of
the State of Alabama in convention assembled, that, as the institution
of slavery has been destroyed in the State of Alabama, hereafter there
shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in this State
otherwise than for the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall be
duly convicted. And be it further ordained that the Constitution be
amended by striking out all provisions in relation to slaves and
slavery. And be it further ordained, that it shall be the duty of the
Legislature, at its next Session, to pass such laws as will protect
the freed men of this State in the full enjoyment of all their rights
of person and property and guard them and the State against all the
evil that may arise from their sudden emancipation."</p>
<p>Cairo despatches report the destruction of 3500 bales of cotton by
an incendiary fire at Memphis, on the 1st. Five thousand eight hundred
bales of cotton in Mobile were also destroyed by incendiary flies on
the night of the 5th and morning of the 6th.</p>
<p>The public debt amounts in English money to 549 millions
sterling. The Secretary of the Treasury has announced his intention to
issue bonds to the amount of fifty millions of dollars in exchange for
the notes which fall due before January next.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson lost his entire
property by the late Concord Bank robbery, with the exception of his
homestead.</p>
<p>An enthusiastic meeting of the Fenian Brotherhood was held at the
Courthouse, Nashville, Tennessee, on the 4th inst. Speeches were made
and sundry resolutions adopted. A large meeting of the brotherhood in
Tennessee was held at Memphis, on the evening of the 3rd. A special
general congress of the entire order of Fenians had been summoned to
meet at Philadelphia, to consider the course affairs are taking in
Ireland.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">There</hi> is an old gentleman who keeps a
bookstall under an archway close by the Biblioth&#x00E8;que
Imp&#x00E9;riale, in the Rue de Richelieu, Paris; and who, in addition
to rare old books and pamphlets, vends literary "curios."... At how
much discount, I wonder, will Fenian bonds be quoted five years hence?
The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent in New York has sent
home a most graphically <hi rend="italic">written</hi> picture of one
of these fantastic securities. In the left-hand top corner is a harp,
in the right a shamrock; then "&#x00A3;1," and the figure of Hibernia
in the centre. The bond is to be convertible into cash "ninety days
after the establishment of the Irish Republic," and are redeemable by
--- Blank. This is judicious. In the left-hand bottom corner there is
a "burst of sunbeams." Poor Fenians! Are they, indeed, the "hereditary
<hi rend="italic">bonds</hi>men whom Daniel O'Connell was so fond of
apostrophising?</p>
<p>It is worth noting that these shadowy shin-plasters are said to be
engraved by the American Continental Bank-Note Company, a very wealthy
corporation, doing an immense business. They have in their employ some
of the very finest line engravers living, and their album of proofs,
which I have seen, contains some really magnificent specimens of
chalcography. But the subjects on which the burin has been employed
form a most wonderful salmagundi. The banks in the United States way
be counted by thousands; every bank is ambitious to have a distinctive
and original form of note for its issue, and the result is a perfect
chaos of ships in full sail, steam-engines, beehives, "bursts of
sunbeams," star-spangled banners, cornucopias, caryatides, masks and
faces, and allegories of commerce, confidence, and Columbia. Sometimes
the president of the bank causes his own portrait to be engraved on
the face of the note (as Messrs. Lincoln and Chase had theirs on the
greenbacks); sometimes he has a pretty daughter, and has <hi rend="italic">her</hi> effigy
inscribed on the document. For the rest, the Continental Bank-note
Company seem quite indifferent to politics, and will engrave notes for
Canada, New Brunswick, Mexico, or the empire of Brazil, as blithely as
for their own republic....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PANORAMA OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AFTER THE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Conflagration.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Several</hi> Illustrations have been published
from time to time in this Journal showing the ruined condition of some
of the public buildings in Richmond, Virginia, lately the capital of
the Confederate States, as they appeared soon after the evacuation of
that city by the fallen Government and its remnant of an army, whose
retreat was accompanied by an act of wholesale incendiarism, causing
the destruction of a great many offices, factories, shops, and
dwelling-houses. It may still be worth while, as a permanent memorial
of one of the most terrible instances of the destructive fury of a
civil war, to present our readers with the panorama or general view
now engraved, which displays the whole extent of Richmond as it was in
the first week of April last, when it was entered by the Federal
troops, whom President Lincoln followed next day--but a week before
his death by the assassin's hand.</p>
<p>The city of Richmond, which was, until the war of secession, one of
the pleasantest and most beautiful in the United States, had a
population in ordinary times of 40,000 persons, with a fair trade in
tobacco, wheat, and flour, sent to New York, Baltimore, or
Philadelphia, for exportation abroad. It is situated on several hills,
occupying the north bank of the James River, where the Lower Falls
mark the limit of inland navigation. The streets of Richmond, built at
right angles and named after the letters of the alphabet, were rather
neat than picturesque; but, on Shockoe Hill, the West-End or
fashionable quarter of the city, were several fine buildings, of which
the Capitol, shown in our Illustration, is the most conspicuous, and
has fortunately escaped destruction. This edifice, which stands on a
square of eight acres, is adorned with a portico of Ionic columns; it
contains a fine marble statue of Washington, and other works of
art. The official residence of the Government is a large mansion at
the corner of the Capitol Square. The Penitentiary, facing the river,
in the same part of the city, is seen not far beyond. The gaol, the
courthouse, two market-houses, a theatre, an orphan asylum, and the
armoury (shown in one of our former Illustrations), with several
colleges, and about thirty churches, were the other public buildings
of Richmond, not to reckon three or four banks, insurance offices,
flour-mills, iron-foundries, and other establishments of industry or
commerce. The revival of its trade may be expected, from its great
advantages of water-power above the city for manufacturing purposes
and the navigable river below. On the opposite side, connected with
Richmond by three bridges, are the suburban villages of Manchester and
Spring Hill. The town of Petersburg, so stoutly defended by General
Lee, is twenty-two miles to the south. It is to be hoped that the
peace and prosperity of Richmond will never again be disturbed, for
this unfortunate place has surely suffered enough.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FENIAN PROSECUTIONS.</p>
<p>Seven more Fenians were brought before the magistrate at Dublin
yesterday week, and were committed for trial. The prisoners were
mostly from Clonmel and its neighbourhood, and a new informer appeared
on the scene--a man named Power, who had been among the number of the
arrested, and afterwards offered to give evidence.</p>
<p>Some prisoners brought up for examination at Cork and Queenstown
were also committed for trial.</p>
<p>On Saturday last six additional prisoners were brought up before
Mr. Stronge, at Dublin, charged with being implicated in the Fenian
conspiracy--viz., Maurice J. Magrath, described as being a captain in
the 52nd Illinois Volunteers; Mortimer Moynahan, clerk in the <hi
rend="italic">Irish People</hi> office; Joseph Deniffe, tailor; James
O'Connor, James Ryan, and Daniel F. Gleeson, bricklayers. Deniffe was
identified as having received &#x00A3;500 cash for a bill of exchange
at the European Bank in College-green, drawn in his favour on
Messrs. Rothschild, of London, by their New York agent. In his
lodgings were found a drill-book, two revolvers, a bowie knife, and a
photograph of General Corcoran. At the lodgings of Maurice J. Magrath
were found his commission as Captain in the American army and other
documents. A search having been instituted in the house occupied by
James Ryan, James O'Connor, and Daniel F. Gleeson, there wore
discovered concealed in a chimney two bayonets, and in another part of
the dwelling was found a drill-book. Mr. Stronge committed Magrath,
Moynahan, and Deniffe for trial; and, as to the other three prisoners,
on whose part an application to admit them to bail was made, he said
there was a <hi rend="italic">prim&#x00E2; facie</hi> case against
them, though not a strong one, and he remanded them for the present,
pending an application to the Attorney-General to have them allowed to
stand out on bail.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the prisoners charged with Fenianism in Queenstown,
Mr. O'Driscoll, the Town Councillor, whose "tall talking," it was
said, alone got him into trouble; Mr. J. Morony, of Limerick; John
Murray, and Thomas Shannon, were brought up before the magistrates on
remand. The three latter were allowed at liberty on entering into
their own recognisances; and Mr. O'Driscoll on giving bail, himself in
&#x00A3;100 and two sureties in &#x00A3;50 each, all to come up when
called upon.</p>
<p>Four young men were arrested in Carrick-on-Suir yesterday week,
charged with illegal marching, and others with inciting the crowd to
attempt a rescue. They were remanded.</p>
<p>Further arrests have been made in Clare, Limerick, and other
counties.</p>
<p>On Friday evening the gun-boat Nightingale stopped the United
Kingdom, a large vessel trading between Glasgow and New York, in Lough
Swilly, and examined the passengers and their luggage. Fenian papers
were found with one person only, a lady, who was therefore accompanied
by the police to Glasgow.</p>
<p>A poster appeared on Sunday in a prominent place on one of the
Dublin bridges, headed "The Cholera!" and attracted some attention. It
ran:--"As the cholera--that godsend to those amiable gentlemen the
rulers and crowned heads who wish to get rid in a quiet way of the
surplus, or uneasy, or dangerous portions of their subjects--is now
close upon us, it behoves Irish Nationalists to be extremely
watchful. The English Government, no doubt, chuckles at the idea of
its effect in this country, presuming that it will confine itself
almost exclusively to the lower orders, or, in other words, to those
presumptuous shopmen, tailors, and blacksmiths, who would set up a
Government on the model of the grand American Republic." "Fenians," it
adds, "will be hunted up in the field and the workshop, the barracks
and the poorhouse, and made away with on the shortest notice, unless
this Government-assisted plague be counteracted by burning plenty of
gunpowder and a few towns or cities to clear the atmosphere, and
banishing those idle, aristocratic rascals, and those respectable
scoundrels who stink in the nostrils of the honest, industrious, and
patriotic, or national class of the Irish people."</p>
<p>A statement is current in Dublin, and generally believed, that two
sums of &#x00A3;1000 in gold have arrived from America, brought by
hand for the purposes of the defence of the Fenian
conspirators. Messrs. Butt, Dowse, and Sidney, who are among the
leading counsel at the Irish bar, have already been retained by the
prisoners against whom the major charge is preferred.</p>
<p>Two men were brought before the Dublin magistrates on Monday for
using seditious language in the streets. One swore at the police,
declaring "he was an honest Fenian, had seven revolvers, and would
blow their brains out;" another addressed a crowd, and said "We will
have a fine rebellion, and we are the boys will make them jump."
Neither was under the influence of liquor. They were remanded.</p>
<p>The last of the Dublin Fenian cases were disposed of on
Wednesday. George Hopper was sent for trial on evidence connecting him
with the <hi rend="italic">Irish People</hi>, and also with the
<sic>reciept</sic> of money from America. He denied being a Fenian, and alleged
that his connection with the <hi rend="italic">Irish People</hi> arose
out of friendship for those conducting it, and from their trade
dealings with him. Wrinn, a fire-brigade man, accused of drilling, and
James O'Connell O'Callagan, said to have enlisted many members, were
also sent for trial.</p>
<p>A meeting of the National Association took place on Wednesday
night. The Bishops of Dublin and Cashel spoke hopefully concerning the
intention of the Government in respect of education, and of the
Protestant Church. The Bishops both denounced the Fenian
conspiracy.</p></div2>

<p>A new political element has appeared in America in the efforts made
by the working men to establish eight hours as a lawful day's
work. They are holding mass conventions in all parts of the country,
and in many places have announced that they will vote for no
candidates for office who do not faithfully labour for the eight-hour
system.</p></div2>

proposal that a commission should be appointed to consider all claims
which the English and American Governments should agree to refer to
it, a semi-official announcement has been made explaining that claims
for losses by the Alabama and other vessels of the same character
would be excluded from the jurisdiction of such a

<p>A delegation from South Carolina has had an interview with
President Johnson. Governor M'Grath presented a memorial on behalf of
Mr. Davis. Mr. Johnson replied that pardons must be proceeded with
gradually, and an effort made to execute the law. If treason had been
committed it ought to be determined by the highest tribunal, even if
clemency should come afterwards. There was neither malice nor
prejudice in carrying out that duty, and no disposition existed for
persecution or thirst for blood. Expressions of mutual confidence
passed between the President and the delegation.</p>
<p>The President has pardoned the Confederate Vice-President Stephens
and other leading Secessionists.</p>
<p>Mr. M'Culloch, the Secretary of the Treasury, had made a speech
advocating a convertible paper currency and declaring that if Congress
would fund the legal tender notes the return to a gold standard could
probably be effected without causing any serious embarrassment.</p>
<p>Martial law has been withdrawn in Kentucky by order of the
President.</p>
<p>General Grant has issued an order for the reorganisation of the

and the whole of the coloured troops.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Except</hi> that President Johnson is an
honest and earnest man, the readers of old English fiction might be
reminded by him of the Justice before whom Roderick Random and his
friends were taken, and who opened upon them with a tremendous volley
of indignation, recognising them as old and hardened offenders, and
menacing them with the most dreadful punishment. But, after being
"spoken to" in the next room, the magistrate returned with a smiling
and benevolent face, announced that they were free, and explained that
he had not been really angry, but that it was always his way to terrify
young people when brought before him, in order to produce an enduring
fear of offending the law. When Mr. Johnson became President, he was
described to us as a stern and gloomy dictator, who had arisen to
execute vengeance upon the murderers of his predecessor and upon the
rebels who approved the deed; besides that, he was about to make his
iron hand felt to the remotest corner of the territory that had been
subdued by the North. We can know only what we are told, and we waited
in anxiety and with sorrow to hear that the hangmen were stalking over
the land, and that the after-harvest of death was being reaped. Mail
after mail brought us no such intelligence. A small group of
notoriously guilty persons perished; but since that time we have heard
of nothing but conciliation and pardon. Not a political execution has
taken place; and, the very chiefs of the insurrection having been
forgiven, the President is last seen receiving a deputation that begs
the life of the ex-President, and Mr. Johnson, in a tone of grave
good-nature, intimates that there is no desire to be revengeful, but
that really Mrs. Varina Davis does not write the sort of letter that
might be expected from a lady who wished to deliver her husband from
danger. It is the case of Smollett's magistrate again, with the slight
difference that the London justice was a corrupt old fellow, and the
American President is an upright and right-hearted gentleman.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson's difficulties, which are greater now than they have
ever been, seem likely to be aggravated by his clemency. Neither
friends nor foes appear to be behaving with fitting consideration for
his situation. Of the foes we need say nothing. The rankling sensation
of defeat, and, more excusably, the painful change of social position,
have made the name of the President odious to thousands of
Confederates. Large numbers have been wise, and are making the best of
things, but many are indulging in the smallest revenges; negroes are
persecuted, Northern officials snubbed, and, in certain cases, driven
away, and the suffrages which have been restored to the insurgents are
avowedly used in making demonstrations of detestation of the
Union. All this is unfortunate, but could not be unexpected. If the
President tightens the reins, and even uses the whip, it is not he who
has made such measures necessary. But his friends, or rather those who
represent feelings which he was  erroneously supposed to represent,
are causing much anxiety to him and his Government. They are still for
extremes. They are not satisfied that slavery no longer exists in the
Union, but they insist on elevating the negro to the dignity of the
law-maker, and they declare that his freedom has not been accomplished
while Sambo cannot come dancing up to the hustings, to record with
facetious pomposity his vote for Massa Negrophile.</p>
<p>The absurdity of such a demand cannot escape the American mind. An
American seldom laughs, but he has a keen sense of humour; and the
idea of delegating sovereignty to Quashee and Gumbo is too good to be
thrown aside. But it would be too strong a measure for the wildest
Abolitionist to recommend the extension of the franchise to the black
individual on the ground of his intelligence and fitness for it. That
would be fatally ludicrous. But the advocates of the black franchise,
after premising, and with truth, that most of the negroes are as fit
to vote as most of the Irish who have obtained the privileges of
citizenship, base the claim on another and more plausible
plea. Mr. Mill has helped them to this, and we much regret that he has
done so, because he has supplied arguments to those who cannot see the
whole case, but are rejoiced to use his distinguished name as that of
a supporter of their fanaticism. It is contended that it is necessary
to give the negro his vote, in order to counterbalance the assured
enmity of the South towards the Union, freedom, and Northern
principles.</p>
<p>This seems to us to be a very clumsy method of meeting a
difficulty. If there were no other objection to it, there would be the
great one that it diminishes the chance, or the hope, that one day the
condition of the suffrage in America may be modified. We do not speak
from an English platform. There is not an educated American who, when
at liberty to speak his mind, does not declare universal suffrage to
be the cause why the best class of men eschew politics. Those who
should lead and advise their fellows abstain from that duty, because
with political power equally bestowed upon all, it is the noisy
demagogue who gets to the front instead of the thoughtful
statesman. Could the verdict of the educated class in America be taken
at this moment, it would be for abolishing suffrage, while admitting
to the poll a larger class than is enfranchised in England. Without
denying the abstract right of equality, the American points to the
fact that, with few exceptions, the politicians of his country are
unworthy of her; and the press, which must be a gauge of general
intellect and principle, is utterly unworthy, not only of a noble
Republic, but of the lowest form of civilisation. With such conviction
in the minds of thoughtful Americans, it is sought to increase the
mass of ignorant and irresponsible power by adding to the loafer, the
rowdy, the exiled German, and the emigrant Irishman, the irrepressible
negro as a constituent of the Government.</p>
<p>But an appeal on these considerations would be hopeless. It could
be made only though the American press, and, as it would be in the
highest degree unpopular, it is not to be supposed that the lowest
press in the world would dare to run counter to the feeling of a
public, which, if ignorant, is large, and has money. The only thing
which the Americans ought to bear in mind is, that whereas they have
have been unkindly and unjustly laughed at for many things, some of
which were natural in a new country, and some of which were not
ludicrous<pb n="403"/> at all, they will be the legitimate
laughing-stock of the world the moment that Quashee becomes a
political power. If the banjo is to be introduced into the
Constitution of the United States, there is an end of gravity. If we
are to have State papers dictated by gentlemen who talk the language
of Aunt Dinah, diplomacy will lose its owl-like character, whatever it
may gain in exchange. The subject is full of tempting suggestions; but
we treat it in no spirit of ill-nature, but because there is really
danger lest fanaticism and party hate should impel a Congress, elected
amid excitement, to do that which will bring the "Anglo-Saxon" name
into contempt for all time. We hope for better things. "No, M'm, we
won't marry into Bartholomew Fair," says Major Pendennis, when his
nephew is in love with the actress. Surely Columbia will have sense to
say that she will not marry Gumbo at the altar of the
Constitution.</p></div2>

vast fortune by the manufacture and sale of liqueurs, has erected this
theatre to mark his gratitude towards the town to which he owes his

<p>...Mr. Jacob Ennis has transmitted to the Academy of Sciences at
Philadelphia the continuation of his observations on the colours of
stars and their changes of colour at different times. For instance,
within the last few years the colour of Sirius has changed from red
to white, violet, full green, yellowish green, and bluish green; and
that of Arcturus has varied from red to yellow and orange. Mr. Ennis
is not inclined to attribute these changes of colour to the influence
of the earth's atmosphere, to the optical instruments employed, or to
peculiarities of vision in the observer. He selected as test-stars
Vega and Capella, stars of the first magnitude, the former green and
the latter blue, but failed to observe in them the action of the
atmospheric medium upon their colour, as mentioned by
Humboldt. Mr. Ennis suggests the recording of the colours of all the
stars as frequently as possible, as they appear to the aided and
unaided vision, due attention being paid to the state of the
atmosphere and the influence of the sun and moon.</p></div2>

a Republican Rectification Assembly, had been held, at both of which
the President's policy was approved. By the former negro suffrage was
denounced. Mr. Wendell Phillips, however, has made a speech, in which
he said that President Johnson, in his address to the South Carolina
delegation, ranged himself among the repentant rebels, making himself
three quarters rebel in order that the South might be one quarter
Union. Mr. Phillips denounced the indorsement of the President's
policy by the Republican Conventions.</p>
<p>Mr. Secretary Seward made a speech, on the 20th ult., at Auburn,
in which he said the settlement of national claims would be conducted
without compromising the national dignity and honour. He also made
allusion to the influence of America on the international conduct of
other States, and said that the country would renew the influence it
possessed previous to the civil war. He expected to see republican
institutions, wherever heretofore established throughout the American
continent, speedily vindicated, renewed, and
reinvigorated. Afterwards, he should look for signs of its working on
other continents.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> reopening of the American cotton
trade this summer has been hailed with grateful joy by many thousands
of the working population of Lancashire, and cannot be regarded
otherwise than as a great and happy deliverance for the
cotton-manufacturing districts of England, irrespective of the results
of the Northern victory in the United States, whether as putting an
end to the miseries of civil war or as procuring the abolition of
negro slavery. It may be presumed that it was by way of expressing
congratulation and sympathy with these feelings that the owners of
some of the vessels which have lately arrived with cargoes of cotton
in the port of Liverpool have thought proper to give them such names
as "The Glad Tidings," a ship of that name having entered the Mersey
from one of the American ports not many days ago. We present an
Illustration of this vessel, with another called "The Freedom," also
bringing American cotton, which arrived an hour or two before. We may
receive their arrival as an auspicious token of future peace and
liberty for America, as well as of prosperous commercial intercourse
between America and Britain.</p></div2>

<p>Mdme. Parepa has begun a career of almost unexampled success in
America. The principal New York and Boston journals are enthusiastic
in their descriptions of her vocal triumphs. "It is little more than a
month since," says the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated Newspaper</hi>,
"almost unheralded, save by such encomiums as came to us over the
water, Mdme. Parepa made her first d&#x00E9;but in America. No attempt was
made to forestall public opinion by indiscriminate puffery. She was
left to make her way into public favour, if deserving; the manager
trusting to the good taste of an American musical public for a
satisfactory indorsement. The result has shown the good judgment as
well as the talent of Mdme. Parepa; and we have a success that, since
the days of Jenny Lind, has not been surpassed, and not even equalled,
by that famed artist."--"To-night," says the <hi rend="italic">Evening
Gazette</hi>, "we are to have, through the liberal arrangement of the
Handel and Haydn Society, an opportunity of hearing Mdme. Parepa in a
complete oratorio. Haydn's beautiful "Creation" is selected, and a
better choice could not have been made. Her superb rendering of "With
verdure clad," last Sabbath evening, for which she received
unqualified praise from all who heard her, will increase the desire to
hear her in this and the many other beautiful songs that abound in the
work." "We confess," says another Boston paper, "that, although we
anticipated and predicted a brilliant success for Mdme. Parepa, we
were scarcely prepared for that degree of enthusiasm which has
manifested itself and increased on every occasion, till now her name
is upon every lip, coupled with the <hi rend="italic">few really
great</hi> vocalists who have preceded her.  Rarely has an artist
visited us who has been so readily and generally accepted by our
people as this lady, and it is but justice to add that her uniformly
unaffected lady-like deportment has lent an additional charm to her
brilliant and graceful efforts in securing this happy
result...."</p></div2>

<p>Speaker Colfax's party of tourists have been visiting Washington
Territory, the upper half of old Oregon. One of them writes that its
population is small--less than 20,000; but it holds sure wealth in its
illimitable forests, and probably has large coal deposits. The trees
are so thick and so tall that the ground in the forest could not hold
them, cut and corded as wood. Nearly 100,000,000 ft. of prepared
lumber, masts, and spars, are exported in a year. Trees 6 ft. or 7
ft. in diameter and 200 ft. to 250 ft. high are stated to be very
common, and perhaps rarely out of sight in the forest; 8 ft. in
diameter and 300 ft. high are not at all uncommon. The builder of the
telegraph line has hitched his wire, in one instance, to a cedar which
is 14 ft. in diameter. Colfax's party saw one fallen tree 325
ft. long; and another tree, at 90 ft. from its root, measured 7 ft. in
diameter. Masts are readily procurable straight as an arrow and
without a knot for 100 ft., 40 in. in diameter at 30 ft. from the
base. Washington Territory is said to have more timber, ferns,
blackberries, and snakes than any other Territory or State in the
Union.</p></div2>

<p>The Washington Government, having received official notice of the
removal of all restrictions upon American vessels in British ports,
had given instructions that the most liberal hospitality and courtesy
should be shown by Federal naval officers to officers of the British
Navy.</p>
<p>The abolition of slavery and the repudiation of the Confederate
debt are essential conditions for readmittance of southern States into
the Union.</p>
<p>President Johnson has released John Mitchell, as he intimates, not
from any feeling of consideration to that individual personally, but
out of respect "and as a compliment to a large section of our
countrymen with whom Mitchell was previously identified." This, it is
stated, he made plain to a deputation from the Fenian congress which
waited upon him.</p>
<p>The public debt of the United States has been reduced by 4,000,000
dols. since September.</p>
<p>The steamer Atlanta, on reaching New York, was found to have sixty
cases of cholera on board, among which were fifteen deaths, and was
immediately put into quarantine.</p>
<p>Another correspondence between the Foreign Office and the American
Minister has been published. The English letters are signed by Earl
Russell, and are, as he intimates, the last he would have the honour
to write on the subject. The further correspondence will be conducted
by Lord Clarendon. Mr. Adams intimates that his Government will not
insist on the arbitration which they at first suggested, and with
regard to the mixed commission, he inquires what are the questions
which Earl Russell would refer to it, and what the principles by which
its proceedings would be regulated. Earl Russell promises a reply to
those queries as soon as they can be got ready, and in the mean time
he passes in review all the complaints made by Mr. Adams of breaches
of neutrality during the war, showing how the British Government dealt
with them, to vindicate this country from a violation of international
law in each case.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah, with all her stores, was yesterday week handed over
to the United States Consul at Liverpool. Captain Waddell and the crew
of the Shenandoah were liberated. The Government ordered the release
of all who were not British subjects, and, of course, when this order
was read, no one claimed to be a British subject.</p>
<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>Great alarm prevails in Canada as to the Fenian projects. The
Fenians had threatened a rising there, and, it was said, had a
steamer ready for offensive purposes. Military preparations were being
taken, and Toronto was picketed.</p></div2>

<p>Some later intelligence has been received from Captain Hall's
Arctic expedition. From Repulse Bay, on Aug. 30, in latitude 66
deg. 31 min. N., and longitude 86 deg. 3 min. W., he wrote to
Mr. Grinnell, of New York, that his winter quarters were on the west
coast of Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome, latitude 64 deg. 47 min. N., and
longitude 83 deg. 18 min. W., among a community of Esquimaux. Thence
he had come to Repulse Bay, and was preparing for his search for the
remains of Sir John Franklin's crew; but he made no allusion to his
plans.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stephens</hi>, the Fenian Head Centre in
Ireland, has been arrested. He was captured, with Rickham, Duffy, and
Brophy, on Saturday morning, in a house which he had taken, under the
name of Herbert, in the suburbs of Dublin. When pounced upon by the
police they were found to be well supplied with all the necessaries of
life. The prisoners were brought up at the police court in the course
of the day and remanded, Stephens ostentatiously declaring that he
would not employ any attorney in the matter. Stephens and his
companions were re-examined on Tuesday and Wednesday. Evidence was
given of their connection with the Fenian organisation, and it was
shown by documents found in Stephens's house that he had been in
communication with the prisoners already committed for trial, through
the medium of an attorney named Nolan; and, in fact, was taking a part
in the management of their defence. A German, named Scholfield, who
had been sent to Dublin by the British Consul in New York, proved that
certain documents produced, but not read, were in the handwriting of
John O'Mahony, the head of the movement in America. At the conclusion
of the evidence the magistrate asked the prisoners if they wished to
say anything. Stephens said he did not intend to obtain legal
assistance, because in making a plea or defence of any kind he should
be recognising British law, and he deliberately and conscientiously
repudiated the right or even the existence of British law in
Ireland. He defied and despised any punishment that could be inflicted
upon him. Brophy said he merely wished to deny a report in the
newspapers that he had absconded. The other prisoners intimated that
they would say nothing. They were all fully committed for trial at the
special commission on the 27th inst.</p>
<p>Geary, the Cork leader, is still at large; and, although some time
ago it was reported that he had gone to France, there is a strong
suspicion that he has not left Ireland.</p>
<p>Yesterday week the Dublin Court of Common Pleas heard arguments for
and against the motion by the Attorney-General that the proceedings
against the Lord Lieutenant should be stayed. The argument for the
Government was that the action of the Lord Lieutenant was the action
of the State, and therefore not to be impeached in the law
courts. Judgment was reserved. An episode in the hearing is worth
notice. One of the counsel for Luby, the plaintiff, in the course of
his speech mentioned with praise the name of Thomas Addis Emmett. The
reference was loudly cheered by a part of the audience, whereupon the
Chief Justice ordered the gallery in which the noisy ones were to be
cleared. On Monday the Judges gave judgment in the case. They decided
that no action could be maintained against the Lord Lieutenant in his
official capacity, and the writ was ordered to be taken off the
file.</p>
<p>Judgment was given in the Dublin Court of Queen's Bench last
Saturday, on the application on behalf of the Fenian prisoners, for a
rule for a criminal information against Sir J. Gray, M.P, the
proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Freeman</hi>. The plaintiffs
charged that they had been libelled in the <hi
rend="italic">Freeman</hi> by the insertion of the reports of their
cases at the police court, by leading articles, and by the publication
of certain passages in a pastoral letter of Dr. Cullen. The court
unanimously granted the conditional order as to the leading articles
and the pastoral letter; but refused it in reference to the
police-court reports. The Lord Chief Justice, Justice Fitzgerald, and
Justice O'Brien held that newspapers were privileged to publish police
reports; while Mr. Justice Hayes held they were not, and would have
granted a conditional order in reference to the police reports
also.</p>
<p>The detectives Hughes and Doyle, who aided in the capture of
Stephens and in other Fenian arrests, were shot at, on Sunday evening,
while they were entering the police office in Exchange-court, off
Dame-street. Hughes was struck by a ball in the shoulder and Doyle was
wounded near the spine. The shots were supposed to have been fired
from a window of the house formerly occupied by Hopper, the tailor,
who is in custody on the charge of Fenianism. It has been decided to
arm the division to which Hughes and Doyle belong, the men, it
appears, having applied to the Government for revolvers, "for the
purpose of protecting themselves against assassination."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SHENANDOAH IN THE MERSEY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> arrival of the late Confederate
cruiser Shenandoah in the port of Liverpool, and her surrender by
Captain Waddell to the commander of H.M.S. Donegal, Captain Paynter,
by whom, in obedience to the orders of our Government, she has since
been given up to the consular agents of the United States Government,
have been already made known to our readers. We give an Illustration
of this famous vessel, formerly named the Sea King, built at Glasgow,
in 1863, by Messrs. Alexander Stephens and Sons, on the composite
principle introduced by them, which consists of an iron frame planked
with rock elm below the water-line and with teak above. Her dimensions
are 220 ft. in length, 32 ft. 5 in. in breadth, and 20 ft. 5 in. in
depth; her tonnage is 1018 tons register, or 1180 tons builders'
measurement. She was rigged as a full clipper-ship, and fitted with
engines of 200-horse power by Messrs. A. and J. Inglis, of
Glasgow. She was first chartered by the British Government to take out
troops and a battery to New Zealand; thence she proceeded to Hankow
and Shanghai, loaded a full cargo of teas, and made the passage home
to London in seventy-nine days, inclusive of five days' coaling on the
voyage. On her arrival at London the was chosen by Confederate agents,
bought by a Liverpool man, and cleared ostensibly for Bombay. She was
met off Madeira by the Clyde-built screw-steamer Laurel, which had
also been purchased by a Liverpool man, and had been sent from that
port with the armament of the future Shenandoah. After taking on board
her stores and guns, the Shenandoah hoisted the Confederate flag; the
master, Corbett, who took her out to Madeira, having a bill of sale
made out in his favour, returned and said he had sold his ship. The
Shenandoah, having started on her destructive mission, did vast damage
to the commerce of the Northern states, as long as the war
lasted. About the beginning of this year, she suddenly turned up at
Melbourne, and, after receiving a fresh stock of supplies, sailed for
the North Pacific, where, notwithstanding that the commander was
repeatedly told by the masters of neutral vessels whom he met on the
high seas that the war between the North and South had terminated, he
refused to believe them. Long after Lee's surrender and Davis's
capture, Captain Waddell sunk, burned, and otherwise destroyed whole
fleets of whalers in the Ochotak Sea and Behring's Strait. Nothing
more was heard of the Shenandoah until her arrival a fortnight since
in the Mersey. She had no guns on deck, all her armament being stowed
away below in boxes. The crew of of the Shenandoah numbered 133 men;
and as soon as she was surrendered, Captain Waddell and some of the
officers separated. Since setting out on her work of destruction, the
Shenandoah had destroyed thirty-seven vessels, the majority of which
were whalers, and these were destroyed after the cessation of
hostilities. To show how the operations of the Shenandoah affected the
sperm oil market, we may state that her depredations amongst the
whaling fleets has caused sperm oil to run up from &#x00A3;70 to
&#x00A3;120 per ton, and it is likely to advance still further, as,
until the news of the surrender of the Shenandoah reaches the port
whence whalers depart, the Arctic seas will certainly be bare of the
customary amount of whaling vessels. Captain Waddell, who has written
a letter to Lord Russell to explain his conduct, states that the last
vessel he spoke was the Barracouta, from Liverpool for San Francisco,
from which he learnt that the South was really and truly defeated. On
this he at once stowed away his guns and ammunition in the hold, and
steered for Liverpool, stopping at no other port.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Three Years among the Working Classes in the
United States during the War</hi>. By the Author of "The Autobiography
of a Beggar-boy." (Smith, Elder, and Co.) The title of this book
raises expectations doomed to disappointment. One looks for a round,
unvarnished tale of the author's own experience; of his reasons for
leaving his native country; of the hopes he had formed, and how they
were fulfilled or unfulfilled; of the feelings of his class on the
breaking out of the great Civil War; of the manner in which industry
and wages were affected by the war; of the alacrity or unwillingness
with which native Americans in his position joined the army; of
everything, in fact, social, moral, and political, about which a
three-years' sojourn in the United States would enable him to speak
with authority and as an eye-witness. But, with some pretentiousness
of style, he wields the pen of a censor and critic of the United
States in general; he by no means confines himself to matters in which
he himself took part and on which he might consequently claim a right
to be heard; he "learns from a reliable source," and he "knows by
repute," and he quotes long paragraphs from newspapers and published
reports, and altogether makes up a book after the fashion of
travellers who choose to employ their time in such business, and who,
by education, habit, and discipline, are likely to perform such labour
better than one who calls himself "a working man," and who appears to
be engaged in the hat trade. There is a proverb about the cobbler and
his last, and the same proverb, with the requisite changes, may be
applied to the hatter. If the hatter had written a book touching what
came under his personal observation in the exercise of his trade and
its concomitants he would probably have turned out something original,
interesting, and useful; but the world did not require a warmed-up
hash of stale stories about the degeneracy of the American race, the
flatness across the chest of American women, the deficient supply of
natural nourishment for little Americans yet to be born, the impetus
given to immorality by the institution of boarding-houses, the
looseness of the matrimonial tie, the absurdities and wickedness of
certain advertisements in American newspapers, and all that kind of
thing. It has frequently been commented upon before in better
fashion. Let all encouragement be given to the "working man" who takes
advantage of the fact that the schoolmaster is abroad, but do not
encourage the "working man" in bookmaking. If he have anything to say
which a prophetic soul inspires or an imaginative spirit suggests--or
if he be bursting with enthusiasm--or if his brain, overladen with
ideas, be too much for him--or if his peculiar line of life have
taught him anything which he thinks it may be of advantage to the
world to know--by all means let him publish it; but, in any other
case, he would do well to abstain. Howbeit, the author has some
remarks upon the subject of emigration which may be found useful. Let
hatters attend to the following advice (p. 189):--"If a journeyman
hatter, in any part of the United Kingdom, can earn from twenty-five
to thirty shillings a week, I would certainly advise him to remain
where he is; nor do I know any class of tradesmen, under the altered
circumstances of the country, who are likely to better their
condition." Economical persons, however, may perhaps find themselves
tempted by the statement (p. 190) that "men can be drunk in America
without the use of intoxicating liquors." But the process by which the
desirable result is attained is not mentioned. It may be that personal
disappointment has blinded us to the merits of this book; but it seems
to us that, except in the ninth, fourteenth, and, fifteenth chapters,
the author has performed a work of supererogation....</p></div2>

<p>An American paper states that Colonel Bulkeley's telegraph
expedition has reached Behring's Strait, where the telegraph will
cross from America to Asia, and that the Colonel had sounded across
Behring's Strait to St. Lawrence Bay. The soundings were favourable
all the way across, the bottom being mud. Ground ice was first
discovered off St. Lawrence Bay, which was not favourable for the
laying of the cable, it being shallow and exposed to the south-east
gales. Michigan Bay was found to be full of ice. Package Bay presented
a good bottom and seemed suitable for laying the cable, the Asiatic
side being more mountainous than that of the American. The country was
entirely destitute of timber. The ground was thawed about 30 in. The
Indians on both sides were friendly and promised to be useful. The
Russians had done everything possible to further the
enterprise.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SENSATION OF BEING MURDERED.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Seward</hi> and his son, says the New York
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, have each told,
at the request of friends, the story of their own sensations at the
time of the attempted assassination.</p>
<p>Mr. Frederick Seward said that, on stepping from his bed-room into
the passage, and seeing the assassin, he merely wondered what he was
doing there, and called him to account. On his resisting the fellow's
endeavour to press into Mr. Seward's room, he (the assassin) drew a
revolver, which he presented at Mr. Frederick Seward's head. What
followed, it must be remembered, took place in a few
seconds. Mr. Frederick Seward's first thought was, "that's a navy
revolver." The man pulled the trigger, but it only snapped, and his
intended victim thought, "that cap missed fire." His next sensation
was that of confusion, and, being upon the floor, resting upon his
right arm, which, like his father's jaw, was barely recovered from a
bad fracture--the assassin had felled him to the floor with the butt
of the pistol--he put his hand to his head, and, finding a hole there,
he thought, "that cap did not miss fire, after all." Then be became
insensible, and remained so for two days and more. His first
indication of returning consciousness was the question, "Have you got
the ball out?" after which he fell off again into a comatose
condition, which was of long continuance. On the very afternoon of the
day when Mr. Lincoln was assassinated Mr. Frederick Seward, who was
Assistant Secretary of State, had asked his father what preparation
should be made for the presentation of Sir Frederick Bruce, which was
to take place the next day. Mr. Seward gave him the points of a reply
to be made to Sir Frederick, and he laid the outline of the speech
upon the President's table, and Mr. Lincoln that afternoon wrote out
the reply, adopting Mr. Seward's suggestions, and thus preparing that
reception of the British Minister by President Johnson which was
regarded at the time by the people to whose representative it was
addressed as so friendly, and fair, and dignified. Mr. Frederick
Seward's first inquiry after he came fully to his senses, which was a
long time after the assassination, was, "Has Sir Frederick Bruce been
presented?" He thought that only one night had passed, since he knew
not what had happened to him, and his mind took up matters just where
it had left them.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward's mental experience during his supposed assassination
was in its nature so like that of his son that it raises the question
whether this absence of consternation and observation of minute
particulars is not common in circumstances of unexpected and not fully
apprehended peril. Mr. Seward wa[s] lying upon his side, close to the
edge of his bed, with his head resting in a frame, which had been made
to give him ease and to protect his broken jaw from pressure. He was
trying to keep awake, having been seized upon by a sick man's fancy:
it was that if he slept he would wake up with lockjaw. He was brought
to full consciousness by the scuffle in the passage-way, followed by
the entrance of the assassin and the cry of Miss Seward, "Oh! he will
kill my father!" But he saw nothing of his assailant until a hand
appeared above his face, and than his thought was, "What handsome
cloth that overcoat is made of!" The assassin's face then appeared,
and the helpless statesman only thought, "What a handsome man!" (Payne
was a fine-looking fellow.) Than came a sensation as of rain striking
him smartly upon one side of his face and neck, then quickly the same
upon the other side, but he felt no severe pain. This was the
assassin's knife. The blood spouted. He thought, "My time has come,"
and, falling from the bed to the floor, fainted. His first sensation
of returning consciousness was that he was drinking tea, and that "it
tasted good." Mrs. Seward was giving him tea with a spoon. He heard
low voices around him, asking and replying as to whether it would be
possible for him to recover. He could not speak, but his eyes showed
his consciousness, and that he desired to speak. They brought him a
porcelain tablet, on which he managed to write, "Give me some more
tea; I shall get well." And from that moment he has slowly but
steadily recovered health and strength.</p></div2>

<p>Perhaps the news of most interest from New York is that relating to
the attitude of the Government towards Mexico, in connection with
which General Grant is receiving much popular attention. He has
visited the Union League Club in New York, when, in reply to a speech
of Mr. Beckman expressing sympathy for Mexico and a firm belief in her
coming deliverance, the General said that the speaker's remarks
concerning the future of Mexico expressed his own sentiments. The
President, on the 14th ult., appointed General John A. Logan Minister,
and William A. Browning, Esq., Secretary of Legation, to the "Republic
of Mexico." Colonel Browning has been the private secretary of
President Johnson, and is now succeeded by Colonel Robert Johnson, a
son of the President, in that office. It is authoritatively announced
that the Federal Government, in order to preserve neutrality in the
Mexican war, will allow no armed parties to pass the Federal frontier,
nor permit munitions of war to be sent to either belligerent.</p>
<p>The South Carolina Legislature has adopted the Constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery, thus securing the adhesion of the
necessary number of States to make the amendment form part of the
Federal Constitution.</p>
<p>Mr. Worth, the popular candidate, has been elected Governor of

<p>The Fenians have rented a large house in Union-square, New York,

<p><hi rend="italic">History of the American War</hi>. By
Lieutenant-Colonel Fletcher. Vols. I, II. (Richard Bentley.) The scale
(not only as regards cubic inches, avoirdupois weight, and kindred
characteristics, but also in respect of the labour freely bestowed by
the author and the deep interest he evidently felt in the subject he
has undertaken to write about) on which these two volumes have been
produced lead to the conclusion that the author intended his history
when completed to be--so far as Englishmen at least are concerned--<hi
rend="italic">the</hi> history of the American War. But it is almost
certain that when the author began his work the time had not come, and
it is doubtful whether the time has yet come, for a satisfactory
history of that great and eventful struggle which all but rendered for
ever ridiculous the idea, cherished by many worshipful politicians, of
a single gigantic nation stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
and governed by the voice of the people as by the voice of God, and
which threatened to rivet the fetters of the slave, to open once more
the hideous traffic in human flesh, to stop the propagation of the
Monroe doctrine, and to forthwith demolish the castles built perchance
in air by wise men from the West who saw some astrological meaning in
the conjunction of the stars and stripes. Passions are not yet cooled;
Prejudice has not yet removed the beam from her own eye; Justice
cannot properly hold the scales till the bandage which in the tumult
of parties was torn from her eyes has once more been replaced; and
Peace is not yet sufficiently composed to give her evidence
unregardful of the menacing attitude of War. Truth was drowned in the
mystic well ages ago, and therefore she cannot be expected to appear
in person; and her satellites, who still reverence her memory and
attempt to discharge her functions, have scarcely yet had time to
investigate all matters connected with the memorable War of
Secession. Colonel Fletcher is impartial with the impartiality of one
who has a bias in one direction counterbalanced by a bias in another;
he was apparently led by personal friendships to sympathise with the
Federals, and by general considerations with the Confederates; and he
can possibly enter into the feelings of the self-examining advocate
who satisfied his conscience with the reflection that he had saved
from well-merited hanging as many as he had got sentenced to unmerited
hanging, and that so, on the whole, justice had been done. It will be
strange if Unionists do not fancy they detect in Colonel Fletcher's
tone a decided leaning towards the Confederates, whether he be
discussing the grounds of secession, or narrating the gallant deeds
of Confederate men and Confederate ships, or exalting Mr. Davis and
disparaging Mr. Lincoln. The latter is frequently spoken of or alluded
to in just such contemptuous terms as one might expect the guardsman
to apply to the rail-splitter. But the bullet of an assassin, if no
personal merit in the victim, has rendered detraction nugatory; and
Abraham Lincoln will live in grateful memories as beloved and perhaps
as honoured as George Washington, <hi rend="italic">pater
patri&#x00E6;</hi>. Colonel Fletcher says little or nothing of English
opinion at the commencement of the struggle; he tells the story of the
"Star of the West" and Fort Sumter, the firing upon the flag of the
United States, which kindled in all Unionists a feeling similar to
that described in the words,
<q><p rend="center">a fury seized on them,</p>
A fiery family passion for the name<lb/>
Of Launcelot, and a glory one with theirs,</q>
the bloodless defence, and the ultimate evacuation but he does not,
perhaps wisely, mention the derision with which the leading English
journal and its following received the news; how men made merry over
the want of sport when only two men were killed, and that not in fight
but in saluting their own flag; and how guesses were made about the
probable amount in the end of the "butcher's bill." A wholesome lesson
might have been read, and a touching contrast might have been drawn
between prophecy and reality, At the commencement of the strife
leading article-writers and thoughtless readers laughed merrily; now
the angel of death alone has a right to smile, for he has reaped a
goodly harvest. But perhaps we are better without such reminders. It
may, however, be interesting to remark by the way that, according to a
certain account, "two bullet-gatherers on Gettysburg field sent to
Baltimore fifty tons of lead." Colonel Fletcher is not responsible
for, nor does he mention, this statement: it is to be found in the <hi
rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi>, and may be a piece of American
exaggeration. It may also excite the sneers of those who like large
"butcher's bills," and think that the slaughter at Gettysburg was
unworthy of the leaden shower. Nevertheless, "General Meade
acknowledges to the total loss during the campaign of 28,186 killed,
wounded, and missing." The first of Colonel Fletcher's volumes is
devoted to the first year, and the second to the second year of the
war. The first ends at the period when victory was beginning to smile
on the Federal arms, when Island No. 10 had, by an unparalleled
mixture of science and daring, been captured; when New Orleans had
fallen, dragging down with it the prestige of the Confederates; when
the formidable Merrimac had been destroyed, and when all hope of
Confederate successes by sea was abandoned. The second ends with the
campaign of Gettysburg, during which there were fought on three
successive days three great battles, followed by the retreat of the
Confederates, which, Unionists are fond of remembering (though Colonel
Fletcher, so far as our memory can be trusted, does not mention the
fact), took place on the same day on which Vicksburg surrendered, on
the sacred Fourth of July. Colonel Fletcher had many advantages in his
endeavours to obtain an insight into the affairs of both parties, and
he was an eye-witness of many events; but the accounts of many
eye-witnesses and superintendents of the same event are required ere
its features can be accurately portrayed. It is said that General Lee
is himself about to write the history of his own campaigns, and when
he has written it there will be one contribution towards an accurate
history of the whole war. Should Generals Grant and Sherman and
subordinate officers, both Federal and Confederate, follow General
Lee's plan, and should there be published, a plain and truthful
account of the international questions which have arisen, been
settled, and remain to be settled, posterity may have a more
trustworthy and more instructive narrative than has ever yet followed
the completion of a war. Meanwhile Colonel Fletcher's history may take
no mean place amongst its like; it contains interesting details, fair
critcisms, useful maps, and descriptions easily and yet graphically
written. It does not display the noble style of a Napier, but it is
free from pretentiousness and other disagreeables. The author does not
scorn to notice trivial things which have, nevertheless, some spice of
romance or similar ingredient, and therefore one looked with some
curiosity to see whether he would confirm or contradict the report
which identifies the Confederate General Marmaduke with a
Mr. Marmaduke Constable, of Scotch family and publishing renown; but
we could find no information upon the point.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FENIAN TRIALS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> conviction of Thomas Clarke Luby of
the offence of conspiring to overthrow the sovereignty of the Queen in
Ireland by force of arms and of replacing it by a Republican
Government, and the heavy sentence passed upon him by the Court, will
probably give a mournful satisfaction to a large majority of even his
own countrymen. It is sad, inexpressibly sad, to witness a doom of
civil degradation carried into effect upon a man who has been so
reared as to make it worse than death to him, and to know that one of
gentle blood, of conspicuous gifts, of high intellectual culture, and
of all the social sensibilities and ties which such advantages imply,
will henceforth be ranked with felons, and day by day endure the
ignominy of sharing their lot. The utter desolation and wretchedness
of such a fate in such a case can only be contemplated with bleeding
hearts by those whose springs of pity are not dried up. Nevertheless,
it is a satisfaction to find that the law is strong enough to protect
society from the much more abundant misery which must inevitably have
resulted from the practical development of the designs to which Luby
and his fellow-conspirators had deliberately committed
themselves. Without holding them guilty of the sanguinary intentions
suggested in O'Keefe's letter, it is hardly too much to take for
granted that the desperate counsels it brought under their notice must
have opened their eyes to the possible extremities to which
insurrection, once excited, might be carried by the lowermost of its
forces, and the hearty laugh with which it was received by Luby and
his wife only shows how singularly unreflective must have been their
habit of mind in laying the train which they meant to have exploded in
civil war.</p>
<p>In truth, the entire conspiracy, as disclosed by the evidence,
brings before us a somewhat novel phase of human nature, and one the
philosophy of which has yet to be explained. What has been the
impelling motive of Fenianism? What was the glitter in its promises
which could have dazzled<pb n="550"/> such a mind as Luby's? We see in
it an association of what appears on the surface to be
self-sacrificing patriotism, of generous instincts, of capacities far
from contemptible, and of indomitable energy, with a project as
worthless in itself as to every rational mind it must have seemed wild
and impracticable. How are we to explain the combination consistently
with the known laws by which human conduct is ordinarily regulated? It
is said that there are three hundred thousand Fenians in America and
Ireland: to what is their peculiar susceptibility to the <hi
rend="italic">virus</hi> of rebellion to be ascribed? Not to race; for
Fenianism disclaims all differences arising from blood. Not to
nationality; for the Irish people, as a whole, repudiate the
"brotherhood." Not to misgovernment and oppression; for, whatever may
have been the case in days gone by, Ireland has, for many years past,
enjoyed all the Constitutional rights which belong to England, and she
can point to no wrong inflicted on her by law which she might not, if
she pleased, get redressed by legal methods. Not even to religion; for
Fenianism is no outbreak of religious animosity. What, then, is the
explanation of this phenomenon? It is difficult to give any
satisfactory account of it. May it not be a vague echo of the past,
deriving its own meaning and emphasis from the past alone? An outbreak
of traditional irritation? The reappearance of dim recollections in
the form of revenge? The revival, by the American Civil War, of hopes
and aspirations, of enmities and passions, of restless impulses and
shadowy dreams, which had all but passed away, and which, as invisible
ink by the agency of heat, have been brought out once more by the
tremendous excitement which has recently convulsed the United States?
If so, as we suspect, it will soon disappear; but not less incumbent
was it on the Government of Ireland to grapple firmly with the nascent
mischief as soon as it became fairly tangible.</p>
<p>We rejoice that the danger--so far as there was an element of
danger in the conspiracy--was faced with calmness as well as
determination. The Irish Government, we think, is to be congratulated
on the manner in which it has dealt with the incipient
revolution. When it first began to act, it was laughed at for
attaching too much importance to a ridiculous plot. It is now blamed
for having allowed it time to develop its features. Its best
justification is that it has saved Ireland from confusion, and has
convicted the ringleaders of rebellion, without having had recourse to
any exceptional means. Without exciting more than a momentary alarm,
without using any of its powers to excess, without resort to military
force, without betraying for an instant the slightest tendency to
vindictiveness, it has crushed in the bud what might have grown to be
a troublesome insurrection. No blood has been shed, but crime has been
brought home to the guilty, and justice has been administered in a
considerate and merciful spirit. From the first apprehension of the
culprits to their conviction the law officers of the Crown have given
every facility to the accused for conducting their defence; and in
presiding over their trials the Judges have borne themselves
dispassionately. Seldom, indeed, have State prosecutions been so
entirely free from even a shadow of indecorum. Possibly, the severity
of the sentence passed upon Luby may have excited surprise in some
quarters; but even in this respect, we think, the bounds of moderation
have not been overstepped.</p>
<p>That we may be fully impressed with this conviction we must turn
our thoughts for a moment from the punishment to be endured to the
crime which it was intended to repress. It has been said that history
contains no record of a successful rebellion, for rebellion, when
successful, is changed into patriotism. There is a grain of solid
truth underneath this surface of glittering wit. The lesson that it
teaches, however, is a weighty one; and, if duly pondered, will be
found to condemn armed insurrection, except as a last effort to
relieve one's country from an intolerable pressure of tyranny and
degradation. Circumstances may be conceived in which it would be a
man's duty to bear a flaming brand through the chambers of a
powder-magazine, but to do so in bravado, or for the attainment of any
object short of paramount necessity, would be an offence calling for
the severest penalty. An attempt to overturn the settled order of
Government by recourse to violence involves issues which none can
control, but which are sure of being attended by fearful
calamities. Take the case of Fenianism. If the plans of the
conspirators had ripened into action, Ireland would have become, for
however short a time, the theatre of civil war. What does that imply,
or rather, what in the form of human suffering does it not imply? It
needs but a short memory to revert to what has recently passed on the
other side of the Atlantic. What imagination can calculate the sum
total of agony, bodily and mental, occasioned by that tremendous
conflict? Now, it was to the possibility of such a catastrophe that
the Fenian conspirators deliberately took steps to expose their
country. And for what? To substitute for the free institutions of this
realm a republic on the model of America and to separate Ireland from
her connection with England. Could it have been accomplished--what
then? Would the success have repaid the terrible cost at which it must
have been purchased? But, comparing the means within reach of the
conspirators with the means at the command of Great Britain, was there
even a remote chance of success? Why, their very country repudiated
them and their designs. An insurrection without adequate motive,
without the narrowest ground of hope, denied even the good wishes of
the people it was professedly planned to serve, sure to be prolific of
evil both to the innocent and the guilty, and without promise of even
a semblance of good, ought not to be confounded with patriotism. It is
a measureless crime, and calls aloud for signal punishment.</p>
<p>We would fain hope that the dignified bearing of the Irish
Government in the face of this provocation will somewhat abate the
pretensions of the Fenians across the water, if it do not put a stop
to their designs. At any rate, it may teach Irishmen in Ireland to
contrast the conduct of those who, from a safe distance, would thrust
them into the flames of civil discord with that of the authorities who
seek to protect them from so dire an evil. And when this puerile but
malignant conspiracy is forgotten, as we trust it soon will be, and
its ringleaders are expiating their crime in penal servitude, we are
confident that England will be forward to show her sister nation, who
refused to be wiled away into disloyalty, or to enter into even a
momentary communion with treason, that she has no reason to regret her
steadfastness. Her affairs will be taken in hand with a resolute
determination to sift out from them everything which assumes even an
appearance of injustice or neglect. Her sensitive spirit will be as
far as possible soothed; and Fenianism, though it meant it not, will
have the effect of weaving new ties between the two islands, and in
uniting their respective populations in a real and permanent
"brotherhood."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HEAD-QUARTERS OF THE FENIANS<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">AT NEW YORK.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> New York Correspondent writes as
follows, under date of the 20th of November:--</p>
<p>I send you a sketch of the new Club House, or, as it is termed,
"Head-quarters," lately established here by the Fenian
Brotherhood. The locality chosen by them is a central and very
fashionable one, their large and commodious mansion being situated on
the north side of Union-square, next door to the Everett House
Hotel. Formerly it belonged to a celebrated "elixirist" known as "Dr."
Moffat, who made a large fortune by the manufacture of "Phoenix
Bitters"--a potion with which, under the present tenure of the
building in question, a suggestive coincidence seems to be
connected. The leading spirit of the Fenians is no longer termed the
"Head Centre," but is now President, and the constitution of the
brotherhood is based upon that of the United States. Within a week or
two there has been some little excitement on the Canada border arising
out of an expected Fenian "raid," and proper precautions have been
taken by the Canadian authorities to repulse any attempts that might
be made upon the banks by bands of stragglers such as the termination
of the civil war here has thrown "upon the loose." It is quite
probable that the real object of the Fenian organisation is to
centralise Irish influence in this country. Already a common subject
of complaint among Americans is that America is "too much governed by
the Irish;" and, should the efforts now in motion to make Fenianism
take root here prove successful, the revival of the Native American, or
"Know-nothing," party will probably be the consequent
result.</p></div2>

<p>The following extract from a letter recently written by
Mrs. Lincoln, the widow of the late President of the United States, is
published by the <hi rend="italic">New York
Independent</hi>.--"Truly," writes Mrs. Lincoln, "no sorrow has been
like unto mine. I am as broken-hearted over this overwhelming
affliction as when the terrible tragedy first occurred, and of course
realise it far more. I have lost the most loving and devoted of
husbands, and my dear boys the best father that sons were ever blest
with. 'Until God's love shall place me by his side again,' I shall
know no peace or alleviation of my grief. Knowing him as you did, I am
sure you can pardon and appreciate a wife's great sorrow over so
untimely a loss! How I wish you could have been with my dear husband
the last few weeks of his life! Having a realising sense that the
unnatural rebellion was near its close, and being most of the time
away from Washington, where he had passed through such conflicts of
mind during the last four years--feeling so encouraged, he freely gave
vent to his cheerfulness. Down the Potomac he was almost boyish in his
mirth, and reminded me of his original nature as I remembered him in
our own home, free from care, surrounded by those he loved. That
terrible Friday I never saw him so supremely cheerful. His manner was
even playful. At three o'clock he drove out with me in the open
carriage. In starting, I asked him if anyone should accompany us. He
immediately replied, 'No; I prefer to ride by ourselves to-day.'
During the drive he was so gay that I said to him, laughingly, 'Dear
husband, you almost startle me by your great cheerfulness.' He
replied, 'And well I may feel so, Mary; for I consider this day the
war has come to a close; and then added, 'We must both be more
cheerful in the future. Between the war and the loss of our darling
Willie we have been very miserable.' Every word he then uttered is
deeply engraved on my poor broken heart."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The first session of the thirty-ninth Congress opened on the 4th
inst. We gave in a great part of our Impression last week an outline
of President Johnson's Message to Congress. The President says that
the reconstruction of the Union must be effected by the North's
allowing past disorders to sink into oblivion, and by the South's
adopting the Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery for
ever. Persons charged with treason should be fairly tried by a civil
court, and it should be judicially settled that no State can secede
from the Union. It is proposed to reduce the army to a peace
establishment of 50,000 men, so organised that their numbers may, in
case of need, be raised to 82,000 men. The army estimates have been
reduced from 516,000,000 dollars to 33,000,000 dollars. The currency
should be reduced, and a plan should be devised to pay off the
national debt within thirty years. The President's aim will be to
promote peace and amity with foreign nations; and he believes them to
be actuated by the same disposition. A sincere desire for peace
induced the President to propose that the questions between the United
States and England respecting the outfit and depredations of
Confederate cruisers should be submitted to arbitration; but England
rejected that offer, and proposed a commission to settle claims,
excluding those arising from those depredations. That proposal had
been declined as very unsatisfactory. The claims had not been brought
forward by the United States with the primary object of obtaining
compensation, but with the purpose of establishing important
principles of international law. The President does not advise any
present attempt at redress by legislation; and the future amity of the
two countries must rest on the basis of mutual justice. The United
States Government has abstained from interfering with forms of
Government in Europe, and will regard it as a great calamity "should
any European Power challenge the American people as it were to defend
Republicanism against foreign interference." The correspondence with
France will at the proper time be laid before Congress.</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury's report recommends contraction of
the currency, and provision for the reduction of the debt. There will
be a deficiency of 112,000,000 dols. for the financial year ending in
June next; and that sum must be provided by loans; but in the
financial year ending in June, 1867, there will be an estimated
surplus of 11,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>None of the Southern members had been admitted to take their seats
in Congress; and a joint committee of the Senate and House of
Representatives was expected to be appointed to report whether any of
the rebellious States were entitled to representation in either
house.</p>
<p>The Georgia and Alabama Legislatures had adopted the Constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery, and the Louisiana Legislature had
declared slavery for ever abolished.</p>
<p>Mr. Schuyler Colfax, of Indiana, has been elected Speaker of the
House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Fenian President at New York has got to loggerheads with his
sham senate.</p></div2>

<p>The inquest on the bodies of the five persons who perished through
the collision between the American barque Fanny Buck and the Dover
mail-packet Samphire, on Wednesday se'nnight, was brought to a close
on Saturday. The Samphire left Dover on Wednesday night for Calais,
the weather being thick and foggy. About twenty minutes after leaving
Dover the men on the look-out on board the steamer saw a dim light on
the port bow, and the captain had hardly given the order "Hard a-port"
when the Fanny Buck struck the steamer. The jury returned the
following verdict:--"The jury find that the deaths of the persons in
question was accidental; but that the accident in question might have
been avoided if the barque had shown a better light. In recording this
verdict the jury cannot separate without expressing their admiration
of the conduct of Captain Bennett and the crew of the Samphire for the
coolness and intrepidity displayed by them in their trying position,
which, under God's providence, was the means of rescuing so many
lives; also that great praise was due to Captain Hoet, of the Belgian
steamer, for his ready assistance...</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, December</hi> 23, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is satisfactory, at the season when
peace and good-will are most strongly inculcated, to be able to record
that in the only quarter from which it was possible for England to
expect unfriendliness a demonstration has been made which may fairly
be assumed to indicate that no rupture with this country will be
sought. President Johnson's Message has been delivered. We naturally
look, in the first instance, to see what the President has to say
about England, and we find, as was expected, a paragraph specially
directed to the question of the relations between the United States
and ourselves. We had no right to suppose that the arguments which
have been urged by American diplomacy should not be condensed and
affirmed in the Message. The President reiterates that we were hasty
in acknowledging the belligerency of the South, and refuses to accept
Earl Russell's interpretation of the law of nations in reference to
the damages done by the vessels which escaped from our ports. Were we
disposed to complain, it would be that no credit is accorded to our
Government for the seizures it did effect, in defiance of certain
strongly-expressed feelings here, and that implication of
self-interest on the part of England is attached to what the people of
this country assuredly regret as an accident, for the nation had no
sympathy with blockade-runners, and had something less than sympathy
with the pirates that destroyed defenceless vessels. But it would be
unfair to lay stress upon points which were obviously necessary to the
completeness of the Presidential argument. It is more to the purpose
to observe the general tone and bearing of the paragraph which relates
to England, and to notice that there is not the least attempt to
inflame the mind of America against us, or to do more than place upon
record the view which the Cabinet of Washington takes in opposition to
that of St. James's. The modified arbitration offered by Lord Russell
is declined, as Mr. Adams had all but stated that it would be; but, so
far as words and the absence of words mean anything, we may believe
that the American Government is too well aware of the mighty interests
committed to its charge to be disposed to disturb the minds of men and
the relations of commerce by raising a<pb n="603"/> quarrel on a
question which, compared with the gigantic interests it might imperil,
may indeed be called miserable. Diplomatists may continue to argue it
out, or the issues may be left for future treatment; but it is clear
that the head of the great Republic has too Christian and statesmanly
a sense of his duties to mock the thanksgivings for deliverance from a
terrible war, in which a great and real stake was involved, by
hazarding another disruption of society for the sake of a very
doubtful right, and a very contemptible cause. England, therefore,
while supporting the view of her own Government, cannot but admit that
America is fortunate in the magistrate who had greatness so strangely
and so sadly thrust upon him.</p>
<p>The rest of the Message, with the exception of a congratulation to
the people upon friendly relations with Russia and with China, and
with the exception also of a guarded reference to Mexico--the
President being unwilling to consider what opportunities might present
themselves should it be necessary to provide against foreign
interference--is devoted to topics exclusively American. An exposition
of the indissoluble character of the Union and of the policy of
reconstruction is followed by a reference to the four millions whom
the war has called into freedom. The negro suffrage question is
declared to be one with which the general Government is not competent
to deal, and it is pronounced to be one for the several States. The
freed men are counselled to show patience and the manly virtues. The
President predicts a happy future for the Southern States if they
accept the changes with wisdom and use due energy in recovering what
has been lost by the cessation of unpaid labour. The finance question
occupies a large space in the Message, but it may suffice to state
that America finds herself with a debt of &#x00A3;600,000,000, but
with resources which an improved system of taxation will render equal,
it is believed, to the work of rapidly reducing this burden. In the
eloquent adjuration to the citizens of the States to remember the vast
amount of solid happiness which they possess, and in the prayer for
the long-continued prosperity of the great Republic, every Englishman
will join, and not the less cordially that he is invited to do so at a
time when all Christians are called upon to remember and humbly to
imitate Him whose name they bear.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Not</hi> yet actually committed to the tomb of
its predecessors, but within a span of its appointed term of
existence, the year 1865 deserves a farewell notice. There have been
many more memorable years in the present century--many that stand out
more conspicuously as historical landmarks; and yet, perhaps, very few
within whose limits the future philosophical exponents of the progress
of our race will discover in greater abundance the germs of mighty
changes....</p><pb n="638"/>
<p>The political character of 1865 has been formed mainly by
Transatlantic events. To our cousins across the water its history has
been fuller of sensational passages than the best-written romance,
carrying within it, moreover, an important moral. The last tidings
which have reached us announce the adoption by three fourths of the
States of the "constitutional amendment" abolishing slavery throughout
the Union, thereby stamping the "peculiar domestic institution" as
illegal whereever United States law is administered to the
inhabitants. How powerfully and permanently this change will affect
the destiny of the American Republic it would be rash to foretell; but
its happy consequences will probably be felt long after the events
which led to it have ceased to retain their hold upon national
recollection. And yet what a series of startling facts is that which
culminated in this result, and how large a proportion of it belongs to
the present year! When, in December last, Abraham Lincoln's pathetic
and prophetic Message was being read to Congress, General Sherman's
march through Georgia was within a few days of being completed--a feat
to the accomplishment of which may be traced the sudden and
irremediable collapse of the Confederacy. We need not recapitulate the
incidents which followed--the evacuation of Richmond, the surrender of
General Lee, the assassination of Mr. Lincoln, the conciliatory policy
of President Johnson--memory has not yet lost sight of the summits of
that mountain-range of events, towering, as they do, high above the
average level of the year's affairs. As they catch the eye of
retrospection, awe overspreads the soul; and, as it turns from the
past to the future, it breathes out a fervent prayer that the coming
good may overtop the bygone evil....</p></div2>

<p>We have intelligence from America to the 16th inst., brought by
the City of New York steamer.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has adopted the resolution concerning
the admission of Southern members as amended by the Senate, but
subsequently <sic corr="passed">passeed</sic> a resolution on its own account as stringent
against the South as the original one. A resolution indorsing the
President's reconstruction policy was not allowed to be
introduced.</p>
<p>The Senate has considered the question of the admission of
Southern members, and had permitted to those for Tennessee the
privilege of the floor. Mr. Wilson's bill, declaring null all laws of
the Southern States recognising any inequality in civil rights on
account of colour, has been called up and discussed.</p>
<p>Three fourths of the States having ratified the Constitutional
amendment abolishing slavery, it is now the supreme law.</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury has announced that Spain and Chili
will not be permitted to bring prizes into Federal ports.</p>
<p>The split in the Fenian camp is complete. The senate has impeached
and deposed the president, O'Mahony, for malfeasance and
misappropriation of funds, and had elected W. R. Roberts in his
room. O'Mahony has refused to recognise the validity of this
deposition, and both senate and president are supported by large bodies
of the Fenian brotherhood. Roberts has issued an address calling upon
the Fenians to act promptly and smash up England. It is said that the
Fenians have about &#x00A3;400,000 in hand; a sum sufficient to
maintain the members of the Fenian cabinet in splendour for some time,
but scarcely large enough, one would think, to enable the Fenians to
"smash up England."</p>
<p>Resolutions had been introduced into Congress, and referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, declaring the establishment of the
Mexican empire by France to be opposed to the declared policy of the
Federal Government, offensive to the people, and contrary to the
spirit of their institutions. The resolutions further require the
President "to take such steps concerning this grave matter as will
vindicate the recognised policy, and protect the honour and interest
of the American Government." Both Houses had requested the President
to furnish papers respecting Mexico.</p>
<p>These resolutions have, it seems, stimulated the French Minister to
action. He has opened a correspondence with Mr. Seward, and dispatched
his secretary to France for new instructions. It is rumoured that if
the Federal Government accredit a Minister to Juarez, the French
Embassy will at once leave Washington.</p></div2>

rich hues in the glare of the candles, as if this subterranean vault

vein is 3 ft. wide--three fourths of the entire substance therein
being pure gold; the remainder mainly bismuth. On each side of this
