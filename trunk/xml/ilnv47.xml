INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">UNITED STATES.</p>
<p>The blockade of all United States ports, including Galveston, has
been raised, and they are now open to foreign commerce.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has announced that, in consequence of England not
absolutely withdrawing the twenty-four hours' rule, the Federal
vessels will not pay the customary courtesies to vessels of the
British Navy. The Federal Government also refuses to recognise any
transfer of rebel cruisers, and claims the right to capture them under
whatever flag they may be placed.</p>
<p>President Johnson has appointed Andrew Hamilton of Texas, James
Johnson of Georgia, and Louis B. Parsons of Alabama, provisional
Governors of those States, in accordance with the programme adopted in
North Carolina and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Immense numbers of negroes, past work, have been expelled from the
cities of Georgia. Great mortality prevails among the negroes in
Charleston.</p>
<p>Provisional Governor Holden, of North Carolina, has issued a
proclamation calling for a Convention to amend the State Constitution,
to elect a Governor and Legislature, and to restore the complete rule
of civil law in that State. The Governor exhorts the people to become
loyal, good, and useful citizens. He officially announces to the
coloured people their freedom, and hopes they will become industrious,
as otherwise their race cannot escape extinction. He promises to be
their friend if they do right, but declares that he will aid in
inflicting prompt punishment upon the idle and vicious.</p>
<p>The message of the Governor to the Virginia Legislature urges the
avoidance of all legislation calculated unnecessarily to irritate she
people. He recommends fewer restrictions in the regulation of the
white elective franchise. As neither himself nor the Legislature has
the control of the negro suffrage, they will not deliberate on that
question. An extra Session of the Virginia Legislature was convened on
the 19th ult., at Richmond.</p>
<p>The Governor of Tennessee has ordered the election of a full
Congressional delegation.</p>
<p>Orders have been issued to dismantle the defensive works around
Washington, except twenty-two forts and three batteries, which will be
strengthened and permanently garrisoned.</p>
<p>The Government had ordered a further reduction of the army by
50,000 men.</p>
<p>The 25 per cent restriction duty on cotton west of the Mississippi
had been removed.</p>
<p>The country is now divided into five grand military divisions--the
Atlantic, under General Meade; the Mississippi, under Sherman; the
Tennessee, under General Thomas; the South-west, under General
Sheridan; and the Pacific, under General Halleck.</p>
<p>The grand jury of San Francisco has dismissed the complaint against
the parties charged with organising an expedition to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Breckenridge and six others reached Cuba, on the 11th ult.,
from the Florida coast. They crossed in an open boat.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lincoln has taken up her residence, for the summer, at Hyde
Park, six miles from Chicago.</p>
<p>Mrs. Seward, wife of Secretary Seward, has died of bilious fever,
at Washington.</p>
<p>A delegation of Poles has had an interview with President
Johnson. They say that 20,000 expatriated Poles desire to emigrate to
America. Efforts are being made to get them to settle in Virginia.</p>
<p>The reading of the argument for the defence, in the conspiracy
trials, was continued before the military court in Washington on the
21st ult. Mr. Doster, counsel for Payne and Atzerott, admitted the
guilt of Payne, but urged the Court to consider how far his punishment
should be mitigated on account of his manifest conviction that he was
doing right in attempting to kill Mr. Seward. Payne had, by reason of
his Southern education, his participation at a tender age in war, and
by his residence in districts wherein the Federal troops had caused
great devastation and suffering, become a deadly enemy to the
North. He had erroneously regarded Mr. Lincoln as a tyrant and
usurper, and Mr. Seward as a mortal enemy to the South and her
institutions, and he therefore believed himself right in attempting
his life. The accused was, in his guilt, only a consequence of the
evil teachings of slaveholders, and was no hired tool, but a fanatic,
an enthusiast, and a hero. Apart from his crime, which he (Mr. Doster)
abhorred, he saw much in Payne's character to admire. Mr. Doster
strongly urged the Court to consider the extenuating circumstances of
the case before pronouncing sentence, although the prisoner desired to
die, in the fanatical belief that, by suffering execution, he would
gain a crown of martyrdom.</p>
<p>In behalf of Atzerott, Mr. Doster claimed that the prisoner had,
although at first he considered Booth's propositions, finally shrank
from participation in their execution, merely maintaining an
appearance of co-operation therein to escape Booth's indignation.</p>
<p>An additional argument was read by Mr. Aiken in behalf of
Mrs. Surratt, and the Court adjourned. In consequence of her serious
illness, Mrs. Surratt has been removed from her cell to more
comfortable quarters in the penitentiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Reverdy Johnson has submitted an argument denying the
jurisdiction of the military court for the conspiracy
trial.</p></div2>

<p>Havannah advices announce the arrival of General John
C. Breckenridge in Cuba, after an adventurous voyage, in company with
six other persons, in an open boat, from the coast of Florida. The
persons accompanying General Breckenridge were Colonel Wilson, an aid
to Jefferson Davis, Captain Taylor Hood, formerly commander of the
Tallahassee; Corporal Russell, two Confederate private soldiers, and a
slave of Breckenridge's who refused to leave his master. General
Breckenridge and Colonel Wilson were within forty miles of Mr. Davis
when he was captured, and Captain Hood was actually with him, but
succeeded in making his escape, and on the following day joined
General Breckenridge, and the party at once started rapidly towards
the coast. Crossing Georgia into Florida they descended the St. John's
River in a boat to Jupiter's Inlet, where they met a party of Federal
deserters, from whom they secured a better boat, which they hauled
across the country to an inlet of the sea. After performing Divine
worship the little party launched their boat. They had a narrow escape
from capture on the first day of their voyage. They had beached their
boat on a sand-reef, some sixty miles from their point of departure,
in order to hunt shellfish, which, with Indian corn, constituted their
sole food on the voyage. A Federal steam-transport came in sight, and
a boat put off towards the reef. Captain Hood and the two privates met
the boat, some distance from the reef, and succeeded in convincing the
officer in charge that the party consisted of paroled soldiers, who
were looking down the coast for old wrecks, and they were left
unmolested. After a voyage of three, or, according to some accounts,
eight days, involving great exposure and privation, they reached
Cardenas, on June 11. They were very kindly received by the people,
and the authorities furnished them transportation to Havannah. Colonel
Helm, formerly United States Consul at Havannah, presented
Breckenridge to the Captain-General of the island, who received him
with cordial hospitality and great courtesy, and is said to have
assured him of a safe asylum in the island.</p></div2>

<p>On the 16th of June a stone monument, 27 ft. high, was erected,
with due ceremonial, on a crest a little south of Henry-house, "in
memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July 21, 1861." The spot
selected is where Heintzelman's division made their hardest fight, but
were finally driven back by Kirby Smith. A considerable force of
troops was on the ground, and a large company of civilians; proper
religious exercises were gone through, some addresses delivered, and
then a salute was fired by Captain Smith's Massachusetts battery on
the same spot where Rickett's battery was captured. The battle-field
itself presents few evidences of the engagement. Here and there a
mound indicates a grave, but they are not numerous; and the only relic
found was an old musket barrel.</p></div2>

Leeward Islands, in the Caribbean Sea, containing the richest natural
deposit of phosphate of lime at present known. The island was first
visited by an English gentleman about the year 1814, and again by him
in 1825, on which latter occasion a report was made to the British
Government, but did not meet with that consideration which subsequent
events prove it to have deserved. In 1856 the Americans took
possession of the island, and in the course of a very short time
exported to the extent of 100,000 tons of this valuable fertiliser, to
resuscitate the exhausted lands of the Southern States. Subsequently
their proceedings attracted the attention of a British surveying
expedition, at that time engaged in the West Indies, as may be learned
from a communication to the Royal Agricultural Society<pb n="18"/> of
England, by Sir Roderick Murchison, who, in describing the geological
structure of the island, says:--"I have often regretted that I have
never had it in my power to communicate anything of importance to the
British farmer; I am now, however, enabled to make an announcement
which will, I have no doubt, be as acceptable to agriculturalists as
it is likely to become very valuable to the merchant and shipowner."
It appears that the Americans have already quarried away a
considerable part of the island, and sold the substance in New
York. This transaction led to an official correspondence between the
British and American Governments, and eventually the right of the
British Crown to the possession of this valuable deposit was
acknowledged by the United States Government. Sir Roderick Murchison
considers our holding the Island of Sombrero to be of great national
importance, in providing our agriculturists, from a British
possession, with a plentiful supply of a good substitute for the guano
of Peru.</p></div2>

<p>....On Monday the new actor from America appeared at the New
Adelphi, in an American play and an American character. Mr. Owens
then, for the first time, presented himself before the British public,
and produced a new drama, entitled "Solon Shingle." The hero is an
American farmer who, in paying a visit to an American village, makes
himself at home wherever he is, and practises a familiarity so free
and easy that he scarcely recognizes any distinction between <hi
rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuum.</hi> The
nonchalance and provincialism of the character are very striking and
novel; the make-up is admirable. The old man toddles about, and
interferes in every thing, intruding himself into a merchant's store
at a late hour in the evening, and even into the Court of Justice,
standing up as a witness in a cause with which he had nothing to
do. In these different situations he spins a variety of yarns, in
which the most is made of nothing, the peculiarities of character
being brought out by minute details, which have no importance but as
they illustrate an individuality. Altogether, this is a remarkable
performance, and may make a sensation....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A "Shoddy" Millionaire At New York</hi>.--One
day, when Tommy was "doing" New York, he strode into Tiffany's
magnificent jewellery establishment, on Broadway, and startled the
assembled salesmen with a loud "Show us a diamond!""Here is one, Sir,"
responded an elegantly modulated voice from the "diamond department."
"Eighty dollars, Sir." "Pooh! not such a speck as that; something
bigger." "Allow me to show you this; very pure stone, Sir, 160 dols."
"Nonsense, bigger!" Herewith the gentlemanly salesman (who I have
always suspected to be a noble Lord in difficulties) produced the
brilliant of about the size of a small pea. "Exquisite stone, Sir;
first water, 800." "Look here!" cried Tommy, becoming exasperated, "If
you've got a reg'lar diamond, fetch it out; if you haven't, just say
so." My Lord, half amused, half vexed, here, by way of totally
annihilating his rough customer, brought out the Koh-i-noor of the
place. "Will this suit you, Sir? Moderately fine stone; price, 15,000
dols." "Now you're coming to it!" cried Tommy, decidedly
mollified. "Is this the tip-top biggest?" "It is, Sir," replied his
Lordship, coolly (stroking his beard at the same time, as if to say,
"Now, my rustic friend, I have wasted quite time enough upon you, you
may go.") "You ain't got nothin' bigger, now?" "Nothing, I assure
you." "Then I'll take it." M'Lord, I grieve to say, lost his presence
of mind, and stared; but Thomas at once produced a huge roll of
"greenbacks," counted out the money, and the sale was concluded. This,
as I have been told, occurred more than a year ago. Now, my Lord,
having become somewhat familiar with the ways and means of Shoddy,
would scarcely lift his eyelids were his coalheaver to propose to buy
out the entire concern.--<hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine</hi> for

<p>Sixteen years ago San Francisco was a petty hamlet, lying on the
sandy slope that curved its yellow crescent behind Clarke's Point. A
few whalers and United States men-of-war had touched there at long
intervals and an occsional merchant vessel had taken aboard a cargo of
hides and tallow. The interior was a <hi rend="italic">terra

and emigrants who had partly explored it. In one year after the
discovery of gold had become universally known San Francisco had a
population of about 30,000, and its harbour was filled with ships from
every quarter of the world. Ten years later its population had more
than doubled; and five years later it had nearly doubled again, being
hard on to 120,000.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RECONSTRUCTION, BRITISH AND<lb/>AMERICAN.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Great</hi> work of political reconstruction
is in mid progress in the United Kingdom. We are not, indeed,
refashioning our Constitution. The three estates of the realm, their
proper sphere and limits of action, their mutual duties and
responsibilities, remain what they have been, and are unchallenged by
public opinion. We are meddling with none of our great national
institutions. We are shifting nothing of importance from its ancient
basis. Nevertheless, we have been engaged throughout the week now
closing, and we shall be more or less generally engaged for the next
fortnight, in building up again that part of the machinery of
government which, because it bears the chief stress of legislation and
has a predominant influence on its character and results, is wisely
submitted to periodical renovation with a view to adapt it to such
change as may have passed upon the public mind. The Crown, acting in
conformity with law, has dissolved one House of Commons, and the
country is busy in putting together another. Strictly speaking, the
work is one of reconstruction, but reconstruction in an extremely
limited sense.</p>
<p>In the very thick of the turmoil inevitably occasioned by a general
election there is ground for satisfaction in the knowledge that the
process is attended with no danger. The legislative mechanism which on
Monday morning last was nonexistent, and which even yet is but half
refitted, will be framed on the same model, with two or three trifling
exceptions, as that which has served the use of the present
generation. Such alterations as are now being made will affect merely
the materials of which it is composed. The leading wheels and
principal levers in the machine will, for the most part, be replaced
from the old one. They will, no doubt, be cleansed of some of the
deposit which during six years' work has accumulated about them, and
which had helped somewhat to clog their movements. Friction against
the great outside public will, perhaps, rub away some soil and rust,
and fit them for accelerated action. But no great change is desired or
will be effected as regards them. In conjunction, however, with these
more important parts, there are a considerable number and variety of
minor pieces, all having something to do towards the general result,
and each susceptible, in doing it, of improvement or decay. It is here
that the chief alterations are to be expected. Old and untrustworthy
appliances, or, what in effect amounts to the same thing, those which
are thought to be such, will be cast aside for new and more promising
material. That which is suffered to remain will in many cases be
passed through the fire, hammered into more convenient forms, polished
and lubricated, and, refitted to its former place. There will be a
deal of scouring and cleaning, the substitution of not a little that
is untried for that which after trial is found wanting, and, it is to
be hoped, a general improvement of the machinery in regard to the
parts of which it is composed; but that will be the whole amount of
positive change accomplished or sought. There is nothing in all this
calculated to unsettle public confidence, nothing to excite misgivings
as to the future, no empiricism of which the most timid need to be
afraid.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not mean to imply that change even to this extent
may not or will not involve some change in the action of
Parliament. We shall not assume to judge what may be the character of
the future House of Commons, or what will be the drift of its
policy. Only events will bring either the one or the other fully into
light, But we do regard it as matter of satisfaction that, on the
whole, the process which is being now resorted to will tend rather to
abridge than to widen the distance between the legislatorial power and
the settled convictions<pb n="30"/> and will of the country. Whatever
these latter may prove to be, after the criticism, the siftings, and
the verdict of a general election, they may be embodied in law without
imperilling anything which commends itself to sound sense and just
feeling, and almost as certainly without producing so much as a jar
upon the nervous system of the community. We may anticipate just so
much expansion in the aims and proceedings of the Government as will
be rendered necessary by any expansion which has taken place in the
thoughts and wishes of the public. That is all; and that is an issue
to which every intelligent and well-trained mind will be content to
submit. So that, as far as the United Kingdom is concerned,
reconstruction is but a renovation of means and apparatus, with growth
as the result. The process is far from unimportant. Upon those who
conduct it rests a grave responsibility, but, at least, it is
unaccompanied by serious apprehensions for the future.</p>
<p>Our kinsmen on the other side of the Atlantic are also intent just
now upon the business of reconstruction--but under what different
circumstances and on how much wider a scale! Let it not be supposed
that we allude to the contrast for the sake of self-glorification--we
do so merely, with a view to deepen our own sense of
thankfulness. That they have to face and master, as we can hardly
doubt they will do, a much more searching and difficult problem than
ourselves, cannot be attributed to the superiority of our
qualifications, or of our mode of using them, in any respect. Our good
fortune is, that we long since passed through that stage of national
discipline which they have but just reached, and our hope is that they
will get through it without more permanent suffering than we. Still,
as a simple matter of fact, the processes which are at this moment
operative in the two countries differ so widely the one from the other
in depth, intensity, and duration, that one cannot help viewing then
side by side. The reconstructive work now absorbing the energies of
American statesmanship is not only difficult, but it touches close
upon several dangerous issues. Whereas, in our own case, the past, and
especially, the proximate past, is our mainstay, it is in theirs the
source of disquietude. They have to reconstitute the South, not merely
of new materials, bu after a new model. They have to lay again the
very foundations of society. The civil war has broken up the
pre-existing social system, and has pretty well levelled to the dust
the political edifice. It would seem impracticable to reconstruct the
latter in conformity with the provision of law, and, happily, as we
think, impossible, as well as impolitic, to base society on the
maintenance or rather the restoration of slavery. The consequence is
an immense amount of present confusion, collision, and misery--the
inevitable <hi rend="italic">d&#x00E9;bris</hi> of an armed conflict
on so gigantic a scale. Some time will be required before the dust and
smoke have sufficiently cleared away to allow of a definite plan being
adopted and brought into operation. Much suffering will, doubtless, be
endured meanwhile; but our Transatlantic cousins are not deficient in
a talent for organisation. We believe they will work out the questions
before them in much less time, and much more satisfactorily, than has
been generally expected, and that the social difficulty will, after
its first pressure, yield to the appliances which robust common-sense
will bring to bear upon it.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two countries at the present moment
suggests matter for profitable consideration. A theory has been
advanced by some, that no great nation can fully develop its
capabilities until it has passed through the ordeal of a civil war,
and that, in the course of its history, one such convulsive intestine
struggle is inevitable. We shall not discuss this theory, neither can
we assent to it. It may be true of certain stages of civilisation, but
we question whether it can be predicated as a law applicable to
nations which are, or will hereafter be, the growth of offshoots from
a population already educated and trained in the principles and
practice of self-government. Be this, however, as it may, every fresh
instance presented to us by history of the attainment of political and
social results by violent means makes us doubt whether the process be
not more costly than the end will repay, and whether the mischief done
by it be not so great that the time, the anxiety, the exertion, and
the self-sacrifice required for the work of reparation might not have
sufficed, if employed in conformity with law, to accomplish, within a
given period, all that may have been achieved by the sword, and
without anything like the attendant suffering. The upward and onward
destinies of a people are seldom, if ever, permanently hastened by
force. They are the result of moral culture, and in very few and
exceptional instances is moral culture quickened by the destruction of
property or the effusion of blood. The reconstruction rendered
necessary by mortal conflicts is always difficult, often
disappointing, and sometimes slower in arriving at its
consummation--namely, the settlement of the vital question in
dispute--than the patient use of milder methods would have been. We
may well be thankful that the business on which our fellow-countrymen
are now engaged is one which less than a month will be required to
effect, and which, when effected, will place the country a step in
advance; and we may sincerely sympathise with our American cousins
that their work does not more closely resemble ours in the ease and
certainty with which it may be dispatched. To bind up and heal deep
wounds is a serious affair--to wash and be refreshed is but a trifling
demand on exertion. Such, however, is the difference between what they
and we are engaged in doing at the present time.</p></div2>

<p>Telegrams from New York, to the 1st inst., state that the
conspiracy trial in Washington has been concluded. The Military
Commission has agreed upon the verdict, but it will not be made public
until after it has been either approved or rejected by the
President. The Judge-Advocate previously submitted an argument
asserting that four of the prisoners were fellow-conspirators with
Booth. He contended that the evidence showed that Davis, Sanders,
Tucker, and others, planned and assisted the assassination.</p>
<p>Owing to too close application to his duties, President Johnson has
been indisposed for several days past and unable to take part in
Cabinet meetings.</p>
<p>Colonel Mosby, the celebrated Confederate cavalry raider, has been
pardoned by the President, and has commenced practising law at
Culpepper, Virginia.</p>
<p>A deputation from South Carolina has had an interview with
President Johnson to request the appointment of a civil
governor. Johnson replied that no State would go out of the Union. He
must deal with restoration, not reconstruction. The people of South
Carolina could not be admitted to Congressional representation until
they called a convention and adopted the Federal and State
Constitutional Amendment abolishing slavery. He thought if negro
suffrage were now granted employers would control negro suffrage to
the detriment of the poor whites. He would, after consultation with
his Cabinet, consider the appointment of a governor.</p>
<p>President Johnson has ordered the military authorities at
Charleston not to prohibit political assemblages of coloured
people.</p>
<p>General Terry has issued an order at Richmond that the negroes will
enjoy the same personal liberty and be subject to the same restraints
as whites.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislature has adjourned, after extending the
franchise to those excluded by the Alexandria Constitution.</p>
<p>There have been serious affrays between the Federal soldiers and
the blacks at several places. At Norfolk the troops, aided by the
white inhabitants, had driven the negroes from the town. At Charleston
there had been a fight between the white and black soldiers, and
several were wounded on each side, At Savannah a New York regiment had
mutinied, and refused to do duty with the black troops; forty-three of
the mutineers had been apprehended, and imprisoned in Fort Pulaski. A

and coloured people. Many persons were wounded.</p>

rend="smallcaps">Of Bull Run.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> battles--that of July 21, 1861, and
that of Aug. 29, 1862--were fought between the Confederates and
Federals in the plain traversed by the small river called Bull Run,
which crosses the main road from Washington to Richmond, a few miles
north of Manassas Gap. The scene of the first conflict, one of the
earliest of the war in Virginia, would now scarcely be recognised as a
battle-field. Four years have obliterated nearly all the marks of the
struggle, and the relic-hunter only now and then finds in the grass a
memento of the event. Very few shot and shell remain upon the surface,
the trees are hiding the blotches on their trunks made by bullets, and
the only bones that are found, with few exceptions, are those of
horses, which visitors have not thought of sufficient importance to be
carried away. Some of the fences have been rebuilt, and corn is
planted in many places; while the rapidly-growing bushes hide nearly
all the original features of the field. The battle-field of Groveton,
two miles beyond, towards Warrenton, is more distinctly marked with
traces of battle. Here the shot and shell are thickly strewn, the
trees are splintered, and in many places the forest looks as if it had
been visited by smallpox. The bones of the soldiers of both armies are
scattered over the fields, and the phrenologist may find skulls
enough. A monument has now been erected on each of the Bull Run
battle-fields. These monuments are of chocolate-coloured, sandstone,
thirty feet high, and were erected by the officers and men of General
Gamble's separate cavalry brigade, camped at Fairfax Courthouse. The
monument on the first Bull Run field is situated on the hill in front
of the memorable stone house, on the spot where the 14th Brooklyn, 1st
Michigan, and 1st and 2nd Maine were most hotly engaged, and where
Ricketts and Griffin lost their batteries. The shaft is 27 ft. high,
and bears upon its top a hundred-pound shell. On the pedestal, at each
corner, is a shell of similar size. On one side of the shaft is
inscribed, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Bull Run, July
21st, 1861," and on the reverse, "erected June 10th, 1865." The
monument at Groveton is similar in its proportions, bearing the
inscription, "To the memory of the patriots who fell at Groveton,
August 29, 1862," and on the reverse, "Erected June 10th, 1865." Our
Illustration represents the scene at the consecration, or
"dedication," as it is called in America, of these monuments. The
religious exercises were conducted on the first Bull Run field by the
Rev. Dr. M'Murdy, who read an appropriate service, which was followed
by a hymn written for the occasion by Pierpont; a military parade by
the 5th Pennsylvania heavy artillery, Colonel Gallup; and a salute by
the 16th Massachusetts battery, Captain Scott. At the close of these
ceremonies, eloquent addresses were delivered by Judge Olin, General
Wilcox, General Heintzelman, and General Farnsworth. At the second
monument the services were similar to those described. A large party
of visitors had come from Washington to be present on this
occasion.</p></div2>

<p>The assasination trials are over, and the sentences partly carried
out. Payne, Harrold, Atzerott, and Mrs. Surratt were hanged on the 7th
inst. The Judge of the Supreme Court had previously served a writ of
habeas corpus on General Hancock, in Mrs. Surratt's case, which, by
President Johnson's order, was not obeyed. It is stated that Payne,
previous to his execution, exonerated Mrs. Suratt, and that another
person had subscribed to an affidavit impeaching the testimony of an
important witness against her. Dr. Mudd, Arnold, and O'Laughlin are to
be imprisoned, with hard labour, for life; and Spangler, the stage
carpenter, is to be imprisoned, with hard labour, for six years.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia the Provost Marshal having, by order from
Washington, surrendered a prisoner named Cozzens to the Sheriff, Judge
Thompson has since released him, declaring that the President's power
to suspend the habeas corpus conferred by Congress terminated with the
war.</p>
<p>President Johnson's health is somewhat improved, but he is still
unable to receive visitors. The health of Mr. F. W Seward continues to
improve.</p>
<p>Independence Day, the 4th of July, was celebrated with more than
usual demonstrations of loyalty.</p>
<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation appointing Benjamin
F. Perry Provisional Governor of South Carolina. All the seceded
States, except Florida, have now either provisional or elected local
governments. The details of reconstruction, however, are much more
copious than interesting.</p>
<p>General Grant authorizes the statement that all the white volunteer
troops of the army would be mustered out of service at the earliest
possible day. It was probable that, by the middle of August, there
would not be 10,000 remaining in the whole of General Meade's military
division of the Atlanta.</p>
<p>Advices from the west report the capture of several desperate
guerrillas and murderers.</p>
<p>The military authorities of Richmond had taken precautionary
measures against an apprehended negro insurrection.</p>
<p>The Government are making arrangements to send to Atalanta a
sufficient quantity of supplies to relieve the necessities of the
people in that district, who for some time past had been reduced to
the last extremities of famine.</p>
<p>A committee of delegates, presenting the coloured population of
Virginia, was to meet in Alexandria on the 2nd of August, to consider
the condition and prospects of the race.</p>
<p>The number of applicants to the President for pardon average
between 200 and 300 a day. Papers were issued one day granting pardon
to 180, mostly North Carolinians.</p>
<p>The States of Wisconsin and Iowa have been visited by terrible
tornadoes. The village of Virogna, Vernon County, Wisconsin a place of
about 1200 inhabitants, was nearly destroyed. Seventeen persons were
killed and more than a hundred badly injured. The loss of property was
very great. In Iowa the crops were badly damaged, railroads and
bridges destroyed, and serious damage done in several counties. Heavy
rains succeeding had caused disastrous floods.</p>
<p>Large numbers of Federal troops were landing along the Texas coast
and the mouth of the Rio Grands. Six thousand troops, mostly coloured,
had arrived at Brazos. A detachment had been sent up the river, and
occupied Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> states that the Government had

<p>The Great Eastern, laden with the Atlantic telegraph cable, left
the Nore last Saturday evening, and arrived off Valencia on Wednesday
morning. The Caroline, with the shore end of cable, twenty-seven miles
in length, was detained at Falmouth by bad weather until Monday, and
had to be taken in tow by the Great Eastern off Land's-end the same
day, and taken to Valencia during a heavy sea. The Terrible and the
Sphynx are also off Valencia. In consequence of a heavy rolling sea,
the Great Eastern was unable to communicate with the shore, and went
for shelter to Berehaven Harbour, Bantry Bay, where she will lie until
the shore end of the cable is laid--an operation which will occupy
about two days, and which was to be set about directly the weather
improved. Once started for the Newfoundland coast, the only danger to
be feared i a storm severe enough to drive the Great Eastern from her
course. Messages will be transmitted from the ship on paying out each
fifty miles, so that the public will be able to watch her course from
day to day almost as closely as those on board. On arriving at
Newfoundland a message, already prepared, will be transmitted to the
directors, and the receipt of ths will be considered proof that the
line has been opened.</p></div2>

rend="smallcaps">Government.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Though</hi> published at a somewhat late
period, the series of four Illustrations which we give this week
cannot fail to prove of much interest to our readers. It must be taken
into consideration that our Special Artist at the head-quarters of the
Southern army had numerous difficulties to contend with in the
transmission of his correspondence to this Journal; and it is only now
that, by his arrival in this country, we are placed in a position to
avail ourselves of the last of his experiences in the Southern States
of America.</p>
<p>After the capitulation of General Johnston there was virtually no
armed force left east of the Mississippi; and President Davis, already
a fugitive from Richmond, having been driven from the capital of
Virginia by the surrender of General Lee, found himself again a
wanderer by the wayside, seeking some means of escape from the Federal
columns which were closing in upon him in all directions. Our Special
Artist, as we have already stated, accompanied Mr. Davis in his flight
to within forty-eight hours of his capture. A few of the sketches he
made, while following the ex-President, are now given to the
public.</p>
<p>One of these Illustrations shows the ex-President's train crossing
the Pe-Dee River, in North Carolina. This was a long and tedious
operation. There are usually no bridges over the swift watercourses in
this part of America, and very frequently no fords. Each waggon, with
its team of mules, had in this instance to be ferried across
separately, and this delay, with an enemy following in the rear, was,
to say the least of it, a very anxious affair. In fact, more than one
alarm of the approach of the Federal cavalry was given before half the
train had crossed the river, and the excitement amongst the rearguard
and teamsters was excessive. The horses of the cavalry escort were
made to swim the stream, being stripped of their saddles and their
riders of most of their clothes. The confusion at the landing-place
was enormous, as many of the frightened animals were scarcely in the
water before they threw their riders and struggled to the bank,
charging through the crowd of attendant cavalrymen. Notwithstanding
all this, the entire train passed safely over the Pe-Dee and many
other streams while our Artist was in its company, and the only
misfortune that happened to him was two or three good duckings.</p>
<p>Another Illustration shows Mr. Davis and his Cabinet halting by
the roadside; the ex-President engaged in signing papers which
Mr. Benjamin, his Secretary of State, is handing to him. This was
probably the last official business transacted by the Confederate
Cabinet, and may well be termed "Government by the roadside." Our
readers must bear in mind that at any moment the alarm might be given
of the enemy's advance, and, to say the least, such a condition of
matters was scarcely calculated to give calmness to the deliberations
of the fugitive Government.</p>
<p>The subject of another Illustration is the scene presented by a
sudden alarm, or stampede, which was a very frequent occurrence, owing
to the proximity of the Federal cavalry, who were frequently within
three miles of the camp of the flying President. A scout had only to
dash in and give the alarm when everything went helter-skelter along
the road--President, Ministers cavalrymen, four-muled waggons, and
terrified negro servants, all jumbled up together.</p>
<p>The last of these Illustrations shows the farewell of Mr. Davis to
his escort and staff in the square of Washington, Georgia. It was here
that he determined to continue his flight almost alone; and,
assembling those round him who had sacrificed everything to the
defeated cause, he, with tears in his eyes, begged them to seek their
own safety and leave him to meet his fate. Undoubtedly, it was an
ill-advised arrangement which brought an escort of 1500 men in the
train of a man fleeing for his life; and, when too late, Mr. Davis saw
the error of thus attracting the attention of the entire country
through which he passed, and disbanded them but forty-eight hours
before his capture.</p></div2>

<p>....And so the Great Eastern is fairly off, and if in the ensuing
fortnight the telegraph cable is successfully laid down, amongst the
earliest news that runs along the line at the rate of four words a
minute will be that which relates the trial of Mr. Jefferson
Davis. There is now plenty of force in America, and the admirers of
Mr. Carlyle and a strong Government have their wish. No one can look
at a photograph of President Johnson without seeing that he is a man
of great capacity and of iron will. By-the-way, with what fervour
would the news be received, in America (were it only true) of the
assertion that Carlyle had undertaken the Life of President
Lincoln. "Two men I honour," said that writer; "and no third: first,
the toil-worn craftsman that conquers the earth. Venerable to me is
thy hard hand, hardly-entreated brother! The second is the inspired
thinker....These two, in all their degrees, I honour; all else is
chaff and dust." "Unspeakably touching" is the Carlylese expression
for the effect the sight of the two labourers united in one person has
on him; and in Abraham Lincoln, the eloquent rail-splitter and the
martyred President, surely these were so. The life of a mad despot
like Frederick might possibly be atoned for by the really deeply
instructive life of Abraham Lincoln. Will Mr. Carlyle take it in
hand?</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Things</hi> are looking favourable for the
Atlantic Telegraph. The shore end of the cable was successfully landed
at Valencia on Saturday morning last. Connections were made with the
instrument room at 12.45 p.m., Greenwich time, in the presence of a
large concourse. The Knight of Kerry and Sir Robert Peel made
congratulatory speeches. Three cheers were given for her Majesty and
three for the President of the United States. The paying-out of the
heavy shore cable, twenty-seven miles in length, was completed by the
Caroline late in the evening. Shortly after four, on Sunday<pb
n="83"/> afternoon, the splice with the main cable on board the Great
Eastern was completed, and the paying-out began from the Great
Eastern. Disquieting rumours were circulated on Tuesday to the effect
that the cable was in danger of failure. We are glad, however, to
learn that the hitch which occurred had been put right, and that at
the time of our going to press all was working smoothly. Telegrams
continue to be received from the gentlemen on board the Great Eastern,
signalling that the work of laying the cable is proceeding
satisfactorily; and this gigantic vessel, herself one of the wonders
of the world, which is bearing across the Atlantic the wire that is to
make thought simultaneous in the two hemispheres, has so far advanced
on her voyage that we may indulge in hopes of its successful
issue.</p>

<p>Silver Peak is believed to be as pre-eminent over all silver
mountains as the Iron Mountain of Missouri is superior to all other
iron deposits. Silver Peak is situated east of San Francisco, on the
eastern side of the Sierra Nevada, and nearly one degree south of the
city of Austin. It is some two miles from Castle Mount, an old extinct
crater, about 5000 ft. above ocean level. Near Silver Peak is an
extensive deposit of salt, and not far distant a hill of pure
sulphur. The whole country has a naked appearance, being quite
destitute of vegetation, and bristles with mountains scattered over a
plain of great extent. The dreaded "Valley of Death," upon the plains
of which, along the "old Spanish trail," travellers have suffered so
much, lies but a short distance to the south-east of the crater of
Silver Peak. Little Salt Lake, in Southern Utah, lies directly east of
Silver Peak. At first the searchers after deposits of the precious
metals confined their searches to the Pacific side of the Sierra
Nevada; but discoveries in New Mexico, Arizona, and Virginia city
induced a thorough examination of the east side of the Sierra
Nevada. This resulted in great success, the most brilliant of which is
found in the neighbourhood of Austin, on the line of the great
overland mail, where a city has sprung up within three years which,
Senator Nye says, contains a population of 10,000. From along this
line of exploration the miners are rapidly extending their operations,
both north and south. Recently (within six months) they came upon this
immense deposit near Castle Mount. Twelve exceedingly rich lodes, or
"ledges" as the miners call them, were discovered on that single
mountain. This discovery in an unexpected region is believed to be the
most valuable yet developed. The specimens--a great number of which
have been brought to New York by Colonel Catherwood--are certainly
very remarkable, and merit the attention of the whole financial
community. If there is no mistake--and with the specimens actually
before us we do not see how there can be--a new deposit, superior even
to the Comstock lode, which has furnished so many millions of silver,
is about to pour into our market its limitless supply of this precious
metal.--<hi rend="italic">New York Journal of Commerce.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAYING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the Supplement to this Number,...we
have given an account of all the operations connected with it till the
afternoon of Sunday, the 23rd ult., when the Great Eastern, having
joined the main length to the shore-end of the cable, twenty or thirty
miles from the Irish coast, started on her voyage across the
Atlantic. Next day, as we mentioned in our last week's Paper, a
telegraphic message was received from the Great Eastern, then lying
to, in lat. 52, long. 10, about eighty miles from shore, to say that
some defect had been found in the insulation of the telegraphic
wire. This mischief was supposed to exist about two or three miles
west of the shore-end of the splice, and it was believed to be caused
by the Great Eastern pulling on her end of the cable with too much
strain before the shore-end splice was properly completed. The time at
which this message was sent from the Great Eastern was half-past four
on the Monday afternoon. There was no apprehension expressed regarding
the complete and immediate repair of the damage, and the signals to
the telegraph-house at Valencia continued very distinct. The Hawk was
sent out that evening to go to the Great Eastern and see what was the
matter, while the Caroline was made ready to pick up the splice, if
needful, and repair the fault. Next day a telegram from Mr. Glass, at
Valencia, announced that "the cable was all right; there had been a
hitch, but all was now right." The Great Eastern, being in lat. 52,
long. 12, telegraphed on that day (Tuesday, the 25th) that "a small
fault had been discovered and cut out; she was now paying out again,
and the signalling was perfect; the weather very fine." The nature of
the accident was further explained next day when the Hawk had returned
to Valencia. In cutting off the loose ends of the twisted iron wires,
which form the external covering of the cable, a tiny shred of such
wire had been allowed to adhere to the composition which surrounds the
central electric wire at the core of the cable, and having come in
contact with the latter, had partially destroyed its insulation. This
piece of the cable, however, being submerged at a depth of not more
than two miles, could be raised again withoat much difficulty, and,
the faulty part having been cut out, a fresh splice could be made. On
the Wednesday morning the managing director at Valencia made the
following announcement:--</p>
<q><p>The Great Eastern telegraphs that the distance run at 9.50
a.m. today was 150 miles (nautical). The length of cable paid out at
6.50 a.m. was 150 miles (nautical). The signals are perfect. Weather
very fine.</p></q>
<p>At half-past seven on the same (Wednesday) evening, he again
reported, "All well. Two hundred miles of cable were paid out from the
Great Eastern at 8 p.m. to-day. All well."</p>
<p>The following despatches have since been published, from Thursday
week to last Thursday:--</p>

<p>....<hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> is scarcely so interesting as
usual, though it has some valuable papers. The most important is
Mr. Ludlow's sketch of the Presidents of the United States, somewhat
one-sided in its appreciations, but as lively and vigorous as most of
the productions of this very earnest writer. Jefferson scarcely
receives justice; the recent reaction in favour of the long-neglected
Hamilton having naturally operated disadvantageously to the statesman
who represented the opposite order of ideas. Both were eminent men;
but it is Jefferson's glory to have comprehended the genius of
republican institutions, while his rival scarcely disguised his
preference for a limited monarchy. The practical good sense of the
American people soon ascertained which of them was to be trusted, and
we have no doubt that its verdict will be ultimately confirmed by
posterity. Mr. Ludlow makes a strange mistake in calling President
Adams a Calvinist: he was precisely the reverse. Professor Cairnes, in
his paper on negro suffrage, discusses the most difficult question of
contemporary American politics. It is certain that the President
cannot confer the franchise on negroes without a violation of law, and
it remains for the advocates of the measure to show that such an
infringement is demanded by an imperious necessity. Professor Cairnes
argues the question very forcibly; but it is one that can only be
determined after the most mature consideration. The existence of such
difficulties is President Johnson's sufficient justification for
continuing to keep a tight grasp on the leading men of the
south....</p></div2>

<p>....As most of our readers are probably aware, the shore-end of the
cable, extending 27 miles from land on this side of the ocean, was
manufactured separately from the main length of 2300 miles, by
Mr. W. T. Henley, of North Woolwich, and was conveyed to Valencia by a
vessel belonging to him, the screw-steamer Caroline, which the
Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company had chartered for that
portion of the work. This piece of the cable is the largest and
heaviest ever made, weighing above twenty tons to the mile, and
measuring 2&#x00BD; in. in diameter, at the shore end, but diminishing
gradually, in the last 500 yards outwards, to the ordinary size of the
main deep-sea cable, with which it has been joined. The core or heart
of it is a cable precisely similar to the main length, but wrapped up
in jute yarn, and covered outside by a winding of twelve strands of
galvanised iron wires, three wires to the strand, and each wire a
quarter of an inch thick. Its strength is estimated as equal to a
breaking-strain of ninety tons. Such is the shore-end cable....the
voyage of the Caroline to Valencia, burdened with this cumbrous
section of the telegraphic line, seems to have been the most
difficult and hazardous task that has yet been performed in the whole
progress of the undertaking. the Great Eastern, with the main length
of 2300 miles of cable stowed in three iron tanks, as lately
described--making, with 7000 tons of coal and her other stores, an
aggregate burden of 24,000 tons--left her anchorage at the Nore<pb
n="123"/> on Saturday, July 15; and, with her insufficient
steam-power, had enough to do in getting down the Channel, by screw
and paddles, at the rate of six or seven miles an hour; but, when she
came off the Land's End; on the Monday, she found the Caroline, which
had started ten days before, and had lain weather-bound a week in
Falmouth Harbour, unable to proceed without help. The Great Eastern
was then obliged to take the Caroline in tow, from the Monday to the
Wednesday morning, against a rough south-westerly wind and the
tremendous swell of the open Atlantic, which, though scarcely felt by
the huge Great Eastern, almost overwhelmed the unhappy Caroline. There
was real danger of her being swamped, or rather dragged under the sea,
as she went round the south coast of Ireland on the Tuesday night, the
waves continually dashing over her decks from stem to stern, so that
the men on deck were up to their waists in water. The officers and
crew, who might have relieved themselves by casting off the tow-rope,
endured this severe trial rather than fail to perform their part of
the great work; but it must be considered that the Caroline was ill
chosen for this service, and that, with better arrangements, the
shore-end cable should have been safe at Valencia some time before the
Great Eastern set forth. As it happened, the tow-rope accidentally
breaking when a few miles off the Skelligs Rocks, at five o'clock on
the Wednesday morning, the Great Eastern first arrived alone at
Valencia, which is about twenty miles distant, and the Caroline made
her way in as soon as she could in the forenoon of that day. The Great
Eastern, after landing two or three of the official gentlemen
concerned in the enterprise went into Bearhaven, in Bantry Bay, where
she was to lie securely till the Caroline should have completed the
laying of the shore end, in readiness to meet the Great Eastern and to
form the junction with the main length of cable some twenty or thirty
miles out at sea.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern was accompanied by H.M.S. Terrible and Sphinx,
which met her at Valencia, and are to keep with her in her voyage to
Newfoundland. It should have been mentioned above that the Great
Eastern was assisted likewise in her start from the Nore by another of
the Queen's ships, the surveying-steamer Porcupine under
Staff-Commander Calver, by whose guidance she was enabled to pass
through a deep channel, recently explored and very seldom used, much
more convenient for her than either the Swin or the Alexandra channel,
ordinarily frequented by vessels leaving the Thames or Medway for the
North Sea. But we must return to the Caroline, where we left her, at
Foilhommerum in Port Magee, a narrow inlet of the strait which
separates the Isle of Valencia from the neighbouring coast of Kerry to
the south. To that remote part of the United Kingdom, thirty or forty
miles west of Killarney, had the Telegraph Construction Company
suddenly removed the scene of its operations, which we noticed so
lately at East Greenwich and in the Medway prosperously carried
forward under the eye of the London world; yet, by means of the pens
of the reporters...the public are now made acquainted with the
minutest details of this mighty work.</p>
<p>The road to Valencia, either from Killarney or from Kenmare and
Glengariff, at the head of Bantry Bay, was travelled not without some
delays by the few persons from London who, having made the best of
their way to see the landing of the cable, succeeded in getting there
on the morning of Saturday week. The local staff of the Telegraph
Construction Company had been engaged for some weeks past in various
preparations on the spot. An encampment of the workmen was here or
there to be seen along the road....These tents are pitched by the
side of the road which passes along the shore of Dingle Bay towards
Cahirciveen, at the foot of the Keragh mountains. The central figure
in our Artist's sketch is Mr. Watlock, the superintendent of the works
of the Magnetic Telegraph Company, to whom belongs the line connecting
Valencia with the telegraphic system throughout Ireland. The poles on
which the wire is stretched have, for the most part, been replaced by
new and larger ones. It happened, rather unluckily, that one of these
poles had been knocked down, some say by "an impulsive Irish cow,"
others by a drunken Irish car-driver, on the very day the cable was
landed, so that the news could not be transmitted to us in London
quite so quickly as we should have been glad to receive it, but this
defect was soon repaired.</p>
<p>...[T]he actual landing of the cable from the ship Caroline [took
place] in the small haven at Foilhommerun....This place lies just
under and within Bray Head, the mountain promontory which forms the
south-west corner of the Isle of Valencia, projecting into the
Atlantic Ocean. It is distant six or seven miles across the island
from Knightstown, the port, which occupies a position on the strait
like that of Sonderburg in the Isle of Alsen....A contemporary
reporter gives this description of the scenery:--"We now reach nearly
at the summit of the last hill a low wooden hut, painted black, and
not unlike the summer establishment of some watering-place
photographer. This is the temporary office of the Atlantic Telegraph
Company. Along the waste land, at some distance to the right, are half
a dozen thatched hovels, while a few feet from the grass-grown
turf-wall which divides the field containing this office from the
cliff, you look down upon the Caroline, which is in communication with
the land by a lengthy floating bridge of boats. To the right and left
precipitous rocks rise nearly 300 ft. from the sea, so hollowed at
each side as to give to the securely-sheltered little haven, which is
scarcely a mile from end to end, the conformation of a
horseshoe. Rugged, steep, and utterly inaccessible, save where a rude
and broken path has been formed by the cablemen, these cliffs are
studded with wild flowers and ferns, and variegated by large patches
of the brightest verdure, which alternate with masses of tangled
seaweed and huge blocks of slate and parti-coloured rock. Butler's
Island, a large grass-grown strip of stony ground stretching from left
to right, from the far point of the bay, lessens the opening to the
sea, and materially helps to shelter this beautiful nook, though, as
there is of course neither land nor breakwater between its entrance
and America, it will be readily understood that in rough weather it
presents a very different appearance to the one it wore
yesterday. Then all was smiling, sunny, and calm. The spectator who,
after drinking in the beauties before him from the heights, scrambled
down the rugged path and stood among the men hauling the cable on
shore, or balanced himself on one of the crags arresting his downward
path, was in a magnificent natural amphitheatre, with toiling
peasants, earnest savans, excited seamen, and eager capitalists for
his actors--priests, local gentry, electricians, and telegraphists for
his fellow lookers-on, and the broad Atlantic for his
stage. Mr. Creswick never surpassed the rich hues and bright tints of
the rocks and vegetation around; Frith never painted brighter eyes,
more supple figures, or more picturesquely artistic costumes than
those of the barefooted nymphs assembled to look at Pat or Mike
'helping the tiligraph gintlemin;' Stanfield never transferred to
canvas a more beautiful and varied sea-piece than the one before
us. On the highest pinnacle of the cliff, to the right, the country
people had planted a succession of improvised flags, consisting of
coloured pocket-handkerchiefs, scarlet cloaks, blankets, petticoats,
and what not, which fluttered gaily in the breeze, while all round the
summit a long fringe of lookers-on stood out sharp and clear against
the blue sky, some mounted, some squatted on the ground, dudheen in
mouth, some gesticulating in little groups, and all manifesting the
keenest interest in the proceedings of the day. The peasant's notion
of the mysterious wire is that it will somehow bring him nearer to the
land of promise. Every Irish labourer tells you of the relatives or
friends who have prospered in America; and no man or woman here seems
too old or feeble to hope for the day when their savings will amount
to 'five or six pounds, yer honour,' that they may bid the old country
good-by and begin the world anew. The telegraphic colours, represented
by rosettes of red, white, and blue, made and presented by Lady Capel
Molyneux, decorated the coats or hats of those immediately interested
in the enterprise; and, out of the three or four hundred employed on
the boats and shore to assist in hauling the cable in, it is scarcely
necessary to say no two figures were attired alike. The high-collared,
swallow-tailed blue coat--new, perhaps, before the electric telegraph
was invented, and sadly soiled and threadbare now--worked side by side
with the ragged nondescript garment which had been fustian, but had
reached the stage of hardly-kept-together tatters. Shirts which
blushed darkly at being exposed; jersies blue, red, and brown; caps
and hats of every variety and shape; bare heads, bare legs, and feet,
and arms made up the line. The boats were similarly manned, and
continued this line from the stern of the Caroline, some 700 yards
off, so that the cable was passed literally from hand to hand from
ship to shore." The appearance of this long row of boats was very
striking, and they varied from the smart cutters of the ships and the
trim gig of the coastguard to the ordinary fishing-boat of the
coast. Besides those which formed the line, having eight or ten men,
labourers or fishermen, in each boat, to hand the cable along, there
were detached boats passing up and down, with the experienced persons
who were to direct the landing--about thirty-five boats in all. On
shore, where a trench, 2ft. deep, had been cut across the narrow beach
and up the face of the cliff, to receive the cable, a hundred or more
of the country people, encouraged by the presence of their popular
landlord, Mr. Fitzgerald, the Knight of Kerry, were pulling and
shouting in their Irish fashion, with the utmost enthusiasm, but with
less discretion--for, not being aware that it was necessary to bring
in and lodge upon the beach a certain quantity of cable in excess of
the distance from the ship to the shore, in order that it might be
passed up the cliff and across a couple of fields to the Telegraph
House, these Irishmen, as soon as they got hold of the end of the
future line of communication with America, threw it upon the ground,
and raised a wild "Hurroo!" This was caught and repeated by the crews
of the boats, who, concluding that their work was well done, at once
proceeded to heave the massive rope into the sea. From boat to boat
the first bad example was followed by all until to the dismay of the
cablemen, who could not gain a hearing amid the continued cheers,
every fathom up to the stern of the Caroline was thrown overboard. The
result of this touching enthusiasm was that every foot had to be
underrun, preparatory to the whole operation beginning <hi
rend="italic">de novo</hi>. It took some time to effect this, during
which the Irish were silent enough.</p>
<p>"When the cable bad been underrun, hauled into the boats again, and
the shore end really began to come on land, and was stowed away in
gigantic circles at the foot of the cliff, the scene was one of
extraordinary animation. Numbers of men were in the water to their
waists or shoulders easing the cable over the rocks, while along the
steep path up the cliff was a close row of figures, men and boys, of
every rank, from the well-to-do farmer down to the poorest cottier,
all pulling at the cable with a will, and, as if in atonement for
their first fault of enthusiasm, obeying with silent and almost
childlike docility every signal made by Mr. Glass or Mr. Canning as to
when they were to haul or slack away." Mr. Temple, assistant to
Mr. Canning, with another of the staff, was in the water up to his
neck working as hard as any. By twelve o'clock the cable was well up
the groove which had been cut in the face of the cliff for its
reception; and from this point the work of carrying its massive coils
across the meadows to the Telegraph House was soon accomplished; and
at a little before one o'clock the end, taken over roads, hedges, and
ditches, was brought close up to the house, or hut, a plain wooden
building, already mentioned....Here several of the gentlemen
chiefly<pb n="124"/> interested in the great enterprise were
assembled, with Sir Robert Peel, Chief Secretary to the Government of
Ireland, and Lord John Hay, who had both come with the Knight of
Kerry, having, as well as Mr. Glass, the managing director of the
Telegraph Construction Company (and manufacturer of the main length of
cable) been the guests of the Knight of Kerry, at his mansion of
Glenleam, Knightstown. The simple ceremony with which the cable was
introduced to the telegraph station has not been noticed by other
reporters, but our Artist says, "The end of the cable was taken up by
Mr. Glass and handed to Sir Robert Peel, who passed it through ahole
left for the purpose in the building which forms, pro tem, the
station, where it was speedily connected with the batteries in the in
instrument-room. A signal was then interchanged with the Caroline,
proving that the electric communication was perfect. Three cheers for
the Queen were called for meanwhile, and given with Irish warmth. The
Knight of Kerry briefly addressed the large concourse of ladies and
gentlemen, yeomen and peasantry, now gathered about him. He expressed
his gratification at this auspicious commencement of the work, and
called for three cheers for the Atlantic Telegraph Cable, and three
cheers for Sir Robert Peel. These were most heartily given, and, of
course, were followed by a speech from Sir Robert Peel. He spoke, with
his wonted energy, of the political, social, and commercial benefits
which would be secured if the cable should prove successful; and,
after invoking the aid of Divine Providence, called for three cheers
for the Queen and three for Mr. Glass. In replying, Mr. Glass said
that all human skill could achieve had been applied to the furtherance
of the object, which he hoped was now near its consummation. Sir
R. Peel, having called for three cheers for the President of the
United States, and the Doxology having been sung, Mr. Glass formally
announced the success of the test that had been just applied, and then
the men returned to the beach and filled in the trench in which the
cable lay. Soon after twelve the Hawk arrived from Knightstown, and
towed the Caroline out of the bay to lay the cable, which was done
slowly but safely, under the able superintendence of Mr. Canning,
chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company,
assisted by Mr. Henley and Captain White, the officer commanding the
Coastguard stations along this coast, and who has devoted much care
and attention to obtaining correct soundings along the route to be
taken by the shore end. The Caroline started from the bay at 2.10
p.m. (Irish time)....Telegrams were constantly received from the
Caroline at Foilhommerum station, showing that all was going on
well....It was nearly twelve o'clock at night when a message was
received by Mr. Glass that the Caroline had laid the whole of the
shore-end cable with perfect success, and that its electric continuity
was quite perfect.</p>
<p>On the next day (Sunday week) the operation of joining the shore
end of the cable to the main length was performed at about fifteen
miles beyond the most western of the rugged rocks on the coast of
Ireland. Here the Great Eastern, attended by the Terrible and Sphinx,
was approached by the Caroline, bearing the last half mile of the
shore end. The spectators of the work were on board the Hawk, a
steam-yacht belonging to Mr. Glass, which came upon the scene as the
cable was being drawn from the stem of the Great Eastern to the
Caroline. Among those on board the Hawk were Lord John Hay; Sir
R. Peel, M.P.; the Knight of Kerry, with his daughters, the Misses
Fitzgerald; Captain White, R.N.; and Captain Hamilton; with Mr. W. H,
Russell and Mr. Robert Dudley, who are appointed to be the historian
and the artistic illustrator of the voyage of the Great Eastern across
the Atlantic....Soon after one o'clock the coils of the deep-sea cable
were safely wound on board the Caroline, and the work of splicing them
at once commenced. This was done by stripping both ends of hemp,
outside wires, and gutta-percha for a short distance, till the copper
conductor of the line was laid bare, and pared down to a fine
wedge-shaped point at each end. The connecting conductors were then
overlapped in the form known as a "scarf" joint, and firmly bound
together with fine threads of copper wire, till the junction was made
even stronger than the main portions of the line. The threads and
conductor were then soldered together thickly, and strips of soft
gutta-percha, like bands of brown tape, were wound layer over layer,
and their edges closely pressed, so as to form one homogeneous mass;
till a certain thickness was completed. Then came a coating of
insulated material called Chatterton's compound, and then again
another layer of gutta-percha tape, until the whole was inclosed in
four rings of the gutta-percha and three of the compound. The joint
was then immersed in cold water for testing, and, the signals proving
perfect, the last protection of hemp and outside wire was added, and
the joint sunk again into the sea, that its perfectness as to
conductivity and insulation might be ascertained from the extreme end
of the whole length of the cable on board the Great Eastern. It was
past four o'clock before the last of these tests was concluded, and in
every case they proved to be most satisfactory. At 4.30 the signal was
given and the last fastenings which held it to the Caroline were cast
adrift, and, with a great splash, the final joint of the Atlantic
telegraph and the first thirty miles of its length went down slowly
into the blue water, the depth here being 100 fathoms. The Hawk then
gave the Great Eastern a parting cheer; the Great Eastern fired a
salute of three guns, took a turn ahead, and was fairly off; floating
from her trunks she bore the white jack, an American ensign, the
burgee of the company--the union jack and American stars quartered,
together, the words "Atlantic Telegraph" being on the tail; a red
ensign, a union jack, and the French flag; and from her peak the blue
ensign, which she flies because Captain Anderson is an officer of the
naval reserve. In the five ships thus lying near together all the
British ensigns were used, the Caroline having red, the Great Eastern
and the Hawk blue, the latter because she ranks as a yacht, and the
two men-of-war white. Just before the start, the Captain of the
Terrible, who was on board the Great Eastern, consulting with Captain
Anderson, retired to his own ship, which presently took her place on
the starboard quarter of the big vessel, the Sphinx taking the port
quarter; and so they went away to the West. The Caroline had before
this turned her head to the shore, and now the Hawk followed, and soon
caught her; the Great Eastern and the men-of-war, which had been
passing out of sight on the horizon, were by this time discernible
only by the bank of cloudlike smoke which lay in the golden pathway of
the setting sun....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> are in the same state of anxious doubt
regarding the condition of the Atlantic telegraph cable as we were
left on Thursday, week, when, as announced in our last Publication,
"No communication with the Great Eastern" was the saddening tidings
received from Valencia, rendered the more painful by following close
upon the heels of oft repeated telegrams, "All going on well." At the
time of our going to press with our early Edition, on Thursday night,
the Great Eastern had not arrived, as it was thought she might, off
Valencia, nor had any communication from or news of her been
received.</p>
<p>It seems that a "magnetic storm" came on about the time the signals
ceased; and the Astronomer Royal, observing its violence, was of
opinion that it might account for the cessation of electric
communication. Yesterday week, however, at 1.40 p.m. test was made
from the shore end--a process prohibited to the officials there
without special instruction, and the result was thus
telegraphed:--"Test taken for conductivity. Result shows accident to
cable; total loss of insulation or dead earth, 1250 miles from
Valencia." The following telegram has subsequently been received from
Mr. Glass, managing director of the Telegraph Construction and
Maintenance Company (Limited):--</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Valencia</hi>, August 7.--May's tests to-day,
make the distance of the fault 1175 miles, taking the temperature of
the water at 31. I think the last distance telegraphed is right.</p>
<p>The logbooks of the Persia and the North American, between whose
courses the Great Eastern probably was, show that on the day the fault
or breakage took place she could have experienced no storm.</p>
<p>The shareholders in the Atlantic Telegraph Company held a special
meeting on Wednesday, when resolutions were passed converting the
shares into stock, and issuing &#x00A3;800,000 of shares, at a
preferential dividend of 8 per cent, for completing the existing

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the signs of returning peace most
satisfactory to the observer of affairs in America during the last two

"mustering out," of the various regiments composing the armies of the
United States. One of the stations appointed for this purpose was at
Hart Island, situated at the head of Long Island Sound, about twenty
miles from the city of New York. Since the early days of the war Hart
Island had been used as a general d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t for recruits, a
purpose for which it was admirably adapted by its healthful
situation. Our Correspondent visited the place some weeks ago on the
invitation of Captain Barstow, Aide-de-Camp of General Dix's Staff,
who was the offcer in charge of the arrangements for mustering-out
troops at this post, and had a fast-going steamer at his command. The

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"There</hi> goes reason to roasting of eggs,"
says the very old proverb, implying that even the simplest affair of
life demands a certain amount of common-sense. What are we to think,
then, of men who have before them the most important and elaborate
problem which can occupy the minds of statesmen, and who apparently
begin by withdrawing common-sense from among the aids to the solution?
We allude, as will probably be guessed, to those of the American
politicians who, having to reconstruct the South, propose to give the
suffrage to the unprepared black population. It is difficult to deal
gravely with the idea; but, nevertheless, a powerful party erects it
into a principle, and threatens loudly in its defence.</p>
<p>In accordance with their usual gracious custom when a European
opinion is advanced on a question affecting the Americans, they may
begin by apprising us that the business is not ours, and that,
inasmuch as they have carried on a war without our interference, they
may be supposed equally capable of adjusting the administrative
difficulties arising out of that war. Both propositions we must take
the great liberty of disputing. The business is ours, in a great if
only a secondary degree. With the territorial arrangements of the
Americans, so long as our colonies are unassailed, we admit that we
have not much concern. Whether the States consist of one mighty and
glorious republic, which holds together the most opposite peoples by
force of a sentiment rather than by any natural or very reasonable
union, or whether they fall into two or three divisions, in accordance
with what would seem to be the dictate of instinct, are not
circumstances materially affecting ourselves. It is to our interest
that America should be prosperous and peaceful; and whatever
arrangements may most conduce to render her so must be favourably
regarded by us. It is with her internal condition that we are
concerned; and, looking at the subject from a commercial point of
view, and borrowing an illustration from commerce, we contend that we
have a right to be heard. We are doing much business, and we hope to
do much more, with the great house of Liberty, Johnson, and Co. If
that house chooses to carry on its business in what we think an
inexpedient fashion, and to bring under one roof a miscellaneous
assemblage of "stores" which might be better managed apart, we have no
title to complain. But, as we are very much interested in the success
of the great house, and as we desire to do a good deal with one
especial department, we are surely justified in protesting, when we go
in to attend to our own affairs with it, if, instead of meeting with
liberal managers and gentlemanly clerks, we are handed over to a body
of Ethiopian serenaders, who sit on the counters, neglect the
packages, and sing black ditties during business hours. This is the
sort of thing with which we are now menaced, and we therefore crave
leave to say that customers ought to be considered. The fact that the
Americans are as capable of adjusting administrative difficulties as
of fighting gallant battles is by no means made clear to us by the
other fact that a large number of persons in the States are favourably
inclined towards the Black franchise.</p>
<p>Now, we really cannot go into first principles every time that we
have to discuss important details. Such a process is dear to the
nature of vestrymen and the like, to juvenile debaters in societies,
and to that large class of individuals who, in private life, are known
and avoided as bores. We have often said, and we beg to refer to our
recorded sentiments, that we detest slavery; and, though we wish that
the American slaves had been freed gradually and peacefully, instead
of by a hideous war, we rejoice that slavery has been done away. But
we do not mean to be always saying this. It is with Sambo the American
citizen, and not Sambo the oppressed negro, that we have now to deal;
and we conceive that it is most courteous to that interesting person
himself to treat him in his new capacity, and only to glance at his
unfortunate antecedents when his ambition, or that of his absurd
friends, forces them upon our<pb n="131"/> recollection. We heartily congratulate
him on his freedom, and, that being said, we must use a little freedom
of our own.</p>
<p>The Abolitionists, or the least moderate and sensible among them,
are displaying the bigotry of men with one idea, and they refuse to
listen to the councils of men who have several ideas, and who will not
tolerate slavery of the mind. Having fought out the battle, and having
stricken away the negro's fetters, these pseudo-friends of his insist
that, in spite of the cramping process which he has undergone from
childhood, he is a mental athlete, and suddenly capable of all the
work for which others have had to be trained. Sambo, whose highest aim
had been the avoidance of more work than he was compelled to do, whose
chief happiness had been in fantastic dances and idiotic songs, or,
when he took to religion, in the lowest form of devotional
sentimentality, is now to be an elector, to weigh the merits of
statesmen, and to come dancing up to the ballot-box with an inordinate
development of shirt-collar in honour of the nation, and to record his
choice between Massa Chase and Massa Seward, should those gentlemen be
rival candidates. That such an idea should be seriously entertained is
almost incredible, but we wish that it were only funny. Were the
election one of a municipal councillor or a beadle, it would be richly
comic to see a jobbing tradesman or a pompous bumble soliciting the
support of a black patron and being answered with the ineffable air of
superiority which Sambo can put on; but the choice is to be of men who
govern one mighty empire and hold relations with half a dozen.</p>
<p>England has been so truly and zealously "anti-slavery" that she can
afford to speak out in this matter. It is a mockery to place the
franchise in the hands of the blacks in their present condition, as a
mass. The existence of a few score, or, at most, a few hundred, who
are educated, is nothing in the argument, save that it is the
invaluable exception. To return to our eggs. Charge a man with selling
you a dozen bad, and he exhibits a single fresh one among them, and,
your own case is proved. So with the negroes. Those who pedantically
contend for their enfranchisement, for the sake of a sham consistency,
know perfectly well that they are not to be trusted with the most
ordinary business transaction; and yet it is to such a population that
the choice of political representatives is to be given. The shout of
laughter with which the idea has been received here will be echoed
again and again, but the proportions of the question make it too
important for mere laughter. We appeal to the sanity of America
against its bigotry.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....I see advertised for publication a "Legacy of Fun" bequeathed
by poor President Lincoln. This is probably an English reprint of a
pamphlet well known in the States, and widely circulated during the
lifetime of the lamented deceased, entitled "Old Abe's Jokes." A large
number of the witticisms attributed to Mr. Lincoln must be considered
apocryphal, and many of them are older than the oldest Joe
Millers. Take, for instance, the story of the Widow Zollikoffer's
negro--one of the best related of old Abe, although I don't know
whether it is inserted in the English collection. The Widow
Zollikoffer was a Dutchwoman, and lived in Bourbon County,
Kentucky. Every autumn she was accustomed to make vast quantities of
huckleberry jam; and her negro-man, "Jacky," having a sweet tooth, was
equally accustomed to devour the said jam whenever he had an
opportunity for so doing. One day the widow went out to pay a round of
visits, but, prior to her departure, she told Jackey that, to prevent
his stealing her sweet and sticky stores, she should chalk his lips;
an operation which, to all seeming, she then and there performed. Back
came the widow from her visits. "Well, Jackey," she said, "I hope
you've left my jam alone." "Oh, yes," missus," replied the faithful
African; "nebber touched um at all. Look at um lips!" and he exhibited
his large labials well coated with white. "Why, you rascal," cried the
widow, "<hi rend="italic">I never chalked your lips at all:</hi> I
only made believe!" Mr. Lincoln, it is said, was accustomed to relate
this anecdote, with the addtional remark that all the members of his
cabinet were in the habit of chalking their lips. Now, the story of
the Widow Zollikoffer is delicately paraphrased from one in the
"Decameron" of Boccaccio, about a painter who set out on a journey;
and I have no doubt that, were it traced further back, it might be
found to have been one of the stock stories in the Book of the Sixty,
preserved in the Temple of Hercules.</p>
<p>Returning to Europe lately, I happened to be one hot morning in the
Rue St. Ferr&#x00E9;ol Marseilles. I happened to see in a shop window
a photograph which I instantly recognised as that of Edwin Booth, the
American tragedian. It is a beautiful face, and one belonging to a
most virtuous and upright man, with whom I am proud to have been on
terms of friendship. I stepped into the shop, and asked the gentleman
behind the counter whose portrait it was. "<hi
rend="italic">Mais</hi>," exclaimed he, "it is Boot, the
assassin. Vilk Boot, <hi rend="italic">le mis&#x00E9;rable, le
l&#x00FB;che. La population Marseillaise en raffole.</hi> I have sold
hundreds within the past four weeks." Poor Edwin Booth! for his calm
features to be gibbeted all over the south of France as those of the
desperado of Ford's Theatre. I explained to the shopkeeper the
libellous error into which he had fallen; but he shrugged his
shoulders and said it did not much matter. He had plenty more orders
for "Vilk Boot," and they must be executed.</p>
<p>Of the real Wilkes Booth the actual assassin, I may say, <hi
rend="italic">vidi tantum</hi>. I knew him first in Boston, and
afterwards in Canada. The last time I saw him was at Montreal, in
October, 1864, at a place alled "Dolly's," next door to the
St. Lawrence Hall, and much frequented by the amateurs of "Mint
Juleps" and "John Collinses." There was Wilkes Booth "shouting"
bottles of champagne to the company generally, and jingling handfuls
of gold twenty-dollar pieces--rare enough in North America just
then. He told me he had sold his theatrical wardrobe and was going
south. He was mad drunk; and, even without the aid of
champagne-cocktails, he was mad sober. The man was to all intents and
purposes a lunatic....</p></div2>

<p>Franklinite is a black vitreo-metalloid substance, found in New
Jersey. It is only slightly magnetic; is fused by the blowpipe with
some difficulty, and its composition, according to Berthier,
is--peroxide of iron, 66; red oxide of manganese, 16; and oxide of
zinc, 17. Hitherto it has been merely an object for the cabinet. We
now learn that, when it is combined with forged iron or steel, it
gives excessive hardness, which no tools can penetrate and which is
not destroyed by the action of heat.</p></div2>

emigrants--of whom 52,730 were destined for the United States, 6643

emigration, consisted of persons of English origin; but the number of
Irish emigrants was double that of English, and all the former, except
a few thousands, went to the United States. The Scotch who left their
native country were about 4600. The emigration to the United States

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC  TELEGRAPH.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Arrival Of The Great
Eastern.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Great Eastern has at last arrived,
and the anxiety which had begun to be felt for those on board her is
at an end. That she has so far failed in the object of her mission is
scarcely any news, but the story of that failure is full of
interest. She arrived off Crookhaven on Thursday morning, and
furnishes the following particulars of the operations for laying the
Atlantic telegraph cable:--</p>
<p>The Great Eastern sailed from Valencia, after making the splice
with the shore end, on the 23rd of July, and continued on har voyage
to lat. 51.25, long: 89.6, being 1063 miles from Valencia, and 600
miles from Heart's Content, Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. She had then
paid out 1212 miles of cable, when it parted, on the 2nd of August, at
12.35 p.m., in soundings of 3900 yards, under the following
circumstances:--A partial loss of insulation having bean discovered,
the Great Eastern was stopped to recover that portion of the cable in
which the fault lay, electrical tests placing it probably within six
miles. The cable was passed from the stern to the bow of the ship for
this purpose, and, after getting in two miles of cable, the fault
being still overboard, the cable broke about ten yards in board of the
wheel at the bow, having been injured by chafing on the stern.</p>
<p>Two previous faults had been discovered--the first in soundings of
about 1000 yards, and the second in about 4100 yards--and had been
successfully recovered and made good; and in the first case ten miles,
and in the second two miles and a half, of cable were hauled in.</p>
<p>After the cable parted, a grapnel with two nautical miles and a
half of rope was lowered, the ship being placed so as to drift over
the line of the cable. The cable was hooked on the 3rd, and when 2200
yards of the rope had been hauled in a swivel in the latter gave way,
and 2800 yards of rope were lost, the cable having been lifted 1200
yards from the bottom. On the 4th a buoy, with a flag and ball, was
moored with 500 yards of rope to mark the place. It is in lat. 51.35,
long. 38.42.30.</p>
<p>From the 4th fogs said adverse winds prevented a further attempt
until the 7th, which was then made nearer the end of the cable, and
was unsuccessful from the same cause when the cable had been lifted
about 1000 yards. Another buoy was here placed in lat. 54.28.30,
long. 38.56.9.</p>
<p>A third attempt was made on the 10th, which failed on account of
the grapnel chain having fouled the flukes of the grapnel. The grapnel
and last 800 yards of rope came up covered with ooze.</p>
<p>A fourth attempt was made on the 11th, at 3 p.m., which also
failed through the breaking of the grapnel rope when the cable had
been raised 600 yards from the bottom.</p>
<p>The stock of rope having now become exhausted, it became necessary
to proceed to England for more and stronger tackle.</p>
<p>The practical conclusions unanimously arrived at by those engaged
in the various capacities in the expedition are as follow:--</p>
<p>Firstly--That the steam-ship Great Eastern, from her size and
consequent steadiness, together with the better control obtained over
her by both the paddles and screw, render it possible and safe to lay
an Atlantic telegraph cable in any weather.</p>
<p>Secondly--That the paying-out machinery, constructed for the
purpose by Messrs. S. Canning and. Clifford, worked perfectly, and can
be confidently relied on.</p>
<p>Thirdly--That the insulation of the gutta-percha-covered conductor
improved when submerged to more than double what it had been before
starting; and has proved itself to be the best insulated cable ever
manufactured, and many times higher than the standard required by the
contract. The cause of the two faults which were recovered was in each
case a perforation of the gutta-percha through to the proper conductor
by a piece of iron wire found sticking in the cable. Electrically, the
third fault was analogous to the first. The difficulty may be provided
against in future.</p>
<p>Fourthly--That nothing has occurred to create the least doubt in
the minds of those engaged in the expedition of the practicability of
successfully laying and working an Atlantic telegraph cable; but, on
the contrary, their canfidence has been largely increased by the
confidence obtained on this voyage.</p>
<p>Fifthly--That the Great Eastern steam-ship, supplied with
sufficiently strong tackle and hauling-in machinery for depth of 4000
to 5000 yards, there is little or no doubt of the possibility of
recovering the lost end of the cable and completing the line already
about two thirds laid.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern proceeds direct to Sheerness. All well on
board. She reports having parted company with H.M.S. Sphinx a few days
after starting. The weather was for the most part very calm, but often
foggy and rainy. A stiff breeze blew on two days; but, although the
sea washed over the Terrible, scarcely any motion was observable on
board the Great Eastern, her greatest roll being 7&#x00BD; degrees,
and her greatest pitching 1 to 1&#x00BC; degree. The cable paid out
beautifully, and, owing to its diameter and lightness, the strain
required to prevent too rapid egress never exceeded 14 cwt. Its angle
with the horizon during the paying-out rarely exceeded 9&#x00BD;
deg. No difficulty whatever was experienced in mooring the buoys in
the deepest water, two having been left behind moored with pieces of
cable that had been picked up from a depth of two miles. One of them
rode out a stiff summer gale, its position after nine days being
unchanged. Captain Moriarty's chronometers found the true position of
the ship to within a fraction of a mile.</p>
<p>The Terrible has sailed for Newfoundland to coal.</p></div2>

<p>A summary of the results of the last Census, in 1861, of the United
States and of Canada, respectively, establishes the following
facts:--That during the interval between the last Census and the
preceding one the decennial rate of increase of population in Canada
exceeded that in the United States by nearly 5&#x00BD; per cent,
Canada adding 40.87 per cent to her population in ten years, while the
United States added only 35.58 per cent to theirs. That she brought
her wild lands into cultivation at a rate, in nine years, exceeding
the rate of increase of cultivated lands in the United States in ten
years by nearly six per cent. Canada in 1860 having added fifty acres
of cultivated land to every hundred acres under cultivation in 1851,
while the United States in 1860 had only added forty-four acres to
every hundred acres under cultivation in 1850. That the value per
cultivated acre of the farming lands of Canada in 1860 exceeded the
value per cultivated acre of the farming lands of the United States,
the average value per cultivated acre in Canada being 20 dols. 87
cents, and in the United States 16 dols. 32 cents. That in Canada a
larger capital was invested in agricultural implements, in proportion
to the amount of land cultivated, than in the United States--the
average value of agricultural implements used on a farm having a
hundred cultivated acres being in Canada 182 dols., and in the United
States 150 dols. That, in proportion to population, Canada in 1860
raised twice as much wheat as the United States, Canada in that year
raising 11.02 bushels for each inhabitant, while the United States
raised only 5.50 bushels for each inhabitant. That, bulking together
eight leading staples of agriculture--wheat, corn, rye, barley, oats,
buckwheat, peas and beans, and potatoes--Canada, between 1851 and
1860, increased in her production of these articles from 57 millions
to 123 millions of bushels--an increase of 113 per cent, while the
United States in ten years, from 1850 to 1860, increased their
productions of the same articles only forty-five per cent. That in
1860 Canada raised, of those articles, 49.12 bushels for each
inhabitant, against a production in the United States of 43.42 bushels
for each inhabitant. That--excluding Indian corn from the list--Canada
raised of the remaining articles 48.07 bushels for each inhabitant,
almost three times the rate of production in the United States, which
was 16.74 bushels for each inhabitant. And that, as regards live stock
and their products, Canada in 1860, in proportion to her population,
owned more horses and more cows, made more butter, kept more sheep,
and had a greater yield of wool than the United States.--<hi

mummies. A better-abused party never carried a war to a successful
issue, and by no one have they been more roundly abused than by "Belle

Mr. and Mrs. Hardinge's respective sufferings are recorded. The

it not been for her sex, would undoubtedly have been hanged early in
the war as a spy, and that the latter was a renegade from the Federal
cause--he will consider they were treated not too harshly by the
authorities, whom it would be absurd to hold responsible for
occasional vulgar brutality on the part of underlings. The book is in
eminently "bad style," and, with the assistance of the portrait upon
the frontispiece, will to a great extent destroy those charming ideas

well established in this country that there is scarcely a place of any
note in England, Scotland, or Ireland where his reappearance will not

<p>We read in the <hi rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi>:--"The
disproportion of numbers in the male and female population of all
rapidly-settled new territories of the west has often been commented
upon, and a large amount of gratuitous and disinterested advice has
been from time to time tendered to the excessive female population of
eastern districts in reference to emigration. One of the results of
the war in the United States has been tocause a large preponderance of
single ladies throughout almost all portions of the Union east of the
Rocky Mountains, and the attention of social economists has been
directed to the question of how such a large number of widows and
orphans are to procure a comfortable living and avoid becoming burdens
to the neighbourhoods in which they respectively dwell. Governor
Andrews, of Massachusetts, in his last message to the Legislature of
that State, suggested the propriety of some steps being taken in
regard to the surplus women, but nothing was done. His words, however,
seem to have met with a response from the other side of the
continent. In Washington territory the single men outnumber the single
women by eighty to one, there being less than one hundred single women
in the domain. The authorities of that territory, having their
attention called to the subject by Governor Andrew's remarks, have
undertaken to provide a free passage and good fare from New York to
Washington territory for 300 widows and orphans of Union soldiers
killed in the war. The Hon. A. S. Mercer, of that territory, has
arrived in New York to superintend the movement and see that none but
the most respectable parties avail themselves of the offer. The
steamer is to sail from New York for Panama on the 22nd of next
month. All grown-up girls and women accepting the offer are guaranteed
respectable employment at four dollars in gold per week, immediately
on their arrival, so long as they choose to avail themselves of
it. Although the voluntary transportation of 300 women from the
Atlantic to the Pacific coast is but a drop in the bucket towards
equalising the sexes in either portion of the country, yet it is the
beginning of a very interesting movement, and is sufficiently
extensive for experimental purposes. Should it prove successful, it
will soon be repeated on a larger scale, and engaged in, not only by
other western territories at their own expense, but with the active
co-operation of the States overburdened with surplus female
population."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE DIARY OF THE CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Who</hi> has not read it? Whose pulse has not
fluttered in unison with the vicissitudes which its brief story
exhibits? Who has not uttered a deep-drawn sigh at its mournful
close--a sigh, nevertheless, having in it none of that bitterness with
which we bury dead hopes out of our sight? What "sensational novel"
ever swayed our emotions to and fro as this simple record has had
power to do? It has been truly said that "truth is stranger than
fiction," and this diary vividly illustrates the remark. Seldom,
perhaps, in the annals of civilisation has a mechanical experiment
been more graphically described--certainly never has any involved in
its issue results of higher importance. As an instance of scientific
insight and accuracy it raises our admiration to the highest pitch. As
representing a grand and all-but-successful struggle of art<pb
n="182"/> with stupendous and seemingly invincible obstacles, it has
its passages of intensest excitement. But every step of the narrative
carries along with it hopes and fears which regard ends of
transcendant moment--the linking together, by a kind of mystical
marriage-ring, the Eastern and Western Hemispheres; the bringing them
into daily presence with each other; and the unceasing assimilation of
the one to the other in all that relates to international converse,
commerce, friendship, emulation, progress. This as the "consummation
devoutly to be wished," the near prospect of which kindled enthusiasm,
as from both sides of the Atlantic the experiment was looked forward
to; and it is this which, ever in the mind of the reader, imparts to
the diary such a thrilling interest.</p>
<p>Well, the failure is one which prophesies success. It is
disappointing, but not disheartening. It must needs be accounted an
"adversity," but it has its "sweet uses." It has severely rebuked
carelessness, but, in doing so, has promised to greater care all that
is desired. The prize is too precious to admit of its being given at
random. It can be won by desert alone; but then desert will win
it. The grand but unfortunate attempt has taught us that, in more
senses than one, nothing is stronger than its weakest part. The
shackles of the wire-rope to be used for lifting the submerged cable
had not been made to bear the strain to which they were subjected, on
the presumption, probably, that they would not be required for
use. The utmost precaution was exercised in the construction and
coiling of the cable, with the single exception that, in splicing it,
a few wire ends were allowed to remain in the tanks. Everything was
successful which had been duly prepared with a view to
success--nothing gave way but that which previous calculation and
testing might have forewarned the operators would give way. Science
was not at fault. Art was not at fault where it did its best. It has
been proved to demonstration that the process of laying a perfect
cable across the depths of the Atlantic is not only feasible, but is
as capable of being rendered a certainty as any mechanical process
whatsoever. Human intelligence has gone up to Nature a third time with
its well-studied task, and a third time has been turned down--but this
time with a consciousness that every part of it has been really
mastered, and that it was prevented from passing only by a slip or two
which it can readily guard against in future. Hereafter there need be
no peradventure in the undertaking.</p>
<p>After a studious perusal of Mr. Russell's diary we are able to draw
up an account of the pros and cons affecting the late, and calculated,
if suffered to remain as they are, to affect every future
expedition. The facts of an assuring character are both numerous and
decisive; those which explain the failure are, happily, few and
remediable. The Great Eastern has proved to be thoroughly competent to
her work--steady in her course, easily steered, not materially
disabled by any changes of weather, and roomy enough to admit of any
requisite machinery and to carry with safety the enormous
indispensable amount of tonnage. The cable itself is a triumphant
success, sufficiently strong to bear its own weight, of the right
specific gravity, well fitted when laid to preserve the insulation of
its core, and likely rather to improve than to lose its conductivity
by deep submersion. The scientific skill of the electricians has been
so perfected as to enable them instantly to detect a flaw, and to
point out within a mile or so the place in the cable where it will be
found. The cable may be safely hauled in when necessary until the
fault has been found and rectified, and when the machinery for that
purpose has been strengthened and improved as experience suggests will
probably do its work with the utmost ease and regularity. Should the
cable actually part, its submerged end may be picked up from any depth
and lifted once more on board. All these conclusions have been proved
by actual trial. Yet the expedition failed. The failure, however, was
due to removable causes. Injury to the cable during the process of
paying out arose three times from precisely the same cause, and,
whether attributable to malicious design or to ignorant negligence,
may be certainly avoided hereafter. The repair of that injury on the
last occasion of its occurrence was frustrated simply by the fact that
the machinery provided for such a contingency had been less
scrupulously passed as sufficient than it would have been had it been
foreseen that the moment was coming when the success or failure of the
whole enterprise would depend upon it. That, also, will be guarded
against hereafter. Balancing the known elements of success against the
known elements of failure, we are warranted by reason in looking upon
a Transatlantic cable as not merely a possibility or a lucky accident,
but as a result lying as clearly within the limits of certainty as any
human work that is yet future can be. We now know all that has to be
provided, and that it can be provided, in order to realise the full
extent of our wishes in regard to this matter. We see clearly the
whole process by which this most splendid of projects may be converted
into an accomplished fact. In missing our way, this time, we have
discovered the true way for the next time. The problem is
solved. Henceforth nothing remains to be conjectured. Simple obedience
to known laws is all that is required.</p>
<p>The elements of success being such as we have attempted to
indicate, we congratulate our readers on the fact that the promoters
of the scheme have resolved to test them once more by actual
experiment. They have lost none of their confidence, nor has a
particle of their courage oozed away. What might have been their final
determination if the Great Eastern had returned immediately on the
severance of the cable can be matter of conjecture only. In that case,
possibly, the experiment would have been considered as one surrounded
by too many risks to invite repetition, and years might have glided
away before another attempt would be ventured upon. Happily, such was
not the case. The men to whose conduct the enterprise was intrusted
exhausted all their resources before setting their faces homeward,
and, in their efforts to recover the lost end of the cable,
demonstrated the practicability both of finding and securing it. The
most thrilling portions of the diary have proved also the most
useful. They record successes just where they were least expected,
marred by failures just where they may be surely provided against in
future. The effect of them was marvellous in dissipating gloom, in
reviving hope, and in inspiring confidence. The various telegraphic
companies interested in the completion of the undertaking wisely
concluded to resume operations forthwith. Their first intention was to
construct all the necessary mechanical appliances and send back the
Great Eastern in October to pick up the broken cable, splice it with
what remained on board, and finish the work which accident had
suspended. On consultation with Captain Anderson, however, they
substituted for this plan a much wiser one. The machinery of the Great
Eastern needs repairs, the completion of which would delay any
resumption of the enterprise until the season was so far advanced as
to multiply the risks. It has, therefore, been resolved to wait till
May of next year. Meanwhile, a second cable is to be manufactared,
which will be laid alongside of the first; and, should the effort
succeed, as is confidently anticipated, it is proposed that the Great
Eastern shall commence paying out the unexhausted portion of the old
line at Newfoundland, make for the spot where the fracture occurred,
fish up the broken end, splice it with the newly-laid portion, and so
provide the public with two lines instead of one. The details of this
plan will very likely undergo some modification; but, in substance, it
may be looked upon as adopted.</p>
<p>"None but the brave deserve the fair." Courage, patience, and
perseverance are the qualities which Nature most regards in those who
woo her. In the end, she evermore rewards them. That they have been
and are being conspicuously displayed in the conduct of the present
undertaking cannot be denied; that they may ere long receive the prize
for which they are striving will, we are sure, be the hearty prayer of
all who yearn for the onward and upward progress of the human
race.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE BREAKING OF THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Cable On Board The Great Eastern.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> return of the Great Eastern, bringing
news of the failure of the attempt to lay the Atlantic Telegraph
Cable, the broken end of which lies nearly 2000 fathoms deep in the
ocean, distant about 1000 miles from the shore end in Foilhummerum
Bay, was announced last week; and the authorised journal of the
expedition, written from day to day by Mr. W. H. Russell on board the
Great Eastern, from Monday July 24, to Friday, August 11, has since
been published....</p>
<p>It may be recollected that, on the second day after starting from
the Irish coast, Wednesday, July 25, a fault in the electric
insulation of the cable was detected, and a length of ten miles which
had been submerged in the wake of the ship was picked up again to
examine wheie the fault lay; it was then found that a tiny piece of
loose iron wire had forced its way through the outer covering and the
gutta-percha surrounding the electric wire, so as to come in contact
with the latter; and, when this piece was cut out and a new splice
made, the fault was effectually cured. The cable had again to be
raised and examined in the same way, on the 29th, when the ship was in
2000 fathom water, 636 miles from Valencia, and 1028 miles from
Newfoundland. A total loss of electric insulation, or "dead earth," as
it is called, had been discovered about one o'clock that
afternoon. The ship was stopped at once, and, as soon as the
picking-up machinery could be put in gear, the end of the cable was
hauled in again over the bow, and the faulty portion having been cut
off and laid aside for a minute examination, the remainder was spliced
afresh, and the operation of paying out over the stern of the ship was
recommenced next morning....Slowly but surely the defective portion of
the cable was reached and cut out. "A very painful discovery," says
the journal, "was then made. An incision was visible in one strand of
the hemp covering an external wire, and, on unravelling the strands so
as to expose the insulated wires, a piece of broken iron wire was
found driven through the gutta-percha covering so as to project beyond
it on each side to the extent of the diameter of the cable; one end
was sharp, as if out with a nippers, the other was broken off
abruptly; and the diameter, on the gauge being applied, corresponded
with that of the wire covering the cable. It was impossible to resist
the irritating and sorrowful conviction that such an injury was the
work of some hired cable assassin or some purposeless
malefactor. Mr. Canning showed the cable and the stab to the cablemen
who admitted that the mischief could not have occurred accidentally;
and those who were in the tank when the cable was injured, being of
the same gang as that which was on duty when the other piece of wire
was forced into the cable, were transferred to different duties on
deck. The gentlemen on board the ship formed a corps of supervisors,
who undertook to watch in the tank turn about, and the men employed
gave their acquiescence." We may add that the names of the gentlemen
who performed this voluntary service were Mr. Cyrus Field, Captain
Moriarty, Professor Thomson, Mr. Varley, Mr. R. Dudley, Mr. H. O'Neil,
A.R.A., Mr. Gooch, M.P., and M. Jules Despecher, each twice a day for
two hours at a time.</p>
<p>We take from Mr. Russell's journal, without abridgment, his account
of the actual breaking of the cable, on Wednesday, the 2nd, which he
has justly called "a sad and memorable day." There had been a strong
gale the night before, but the ship scarcely felt it, and went on
paying out cable, without let or hindrance, at a high rate of
speed--seven knots an hour. "About daybreak the wind suddenly shifted
to N.N.W. and fell to a light breeze, and at 4 a.m. the course was
altered to N.W. by W.&#x00BD; W., the sea falling. Morning broke
beautifully, and the cable ran out easily, at the rate of seven miles
an hour. At 5.35 a.m., ship's time, the paddles were reversed by order
from the electricians' room. In fact, at 8 a.m., Greenwich time, or a
minute after, while the electricians were passing the first of the
half-hourly series of currents to the shore, the galvanometer detected
a flaw of electricity which indicated a serious fault. The tests gave
no result as to locality, for the fault was very varying, but it was
generally believed to be not far from the stern of the ship. While
Mr. Cyrus Field was on watch in the tank, a little before the time of
the accident, a grating noise was audible as the cable flew over the
coil. One of the experienced hands immediately said, 'There is a piece
of wire,' and called to the look-out man above to pass the information
aft, but no notice appears to have been taken for some time of the
circumstance. After the ship had been stopped and the remainder of the
flake in which the fault was supposed to iaave occurred had been paid
out, a piece of wire was seen projecting out of the cable in the
fluke, and, on one of the men taking it in his fingers and trying to
bend it down, the wire broke short off. It was nearly 3 in. long, and
evidently of hard, ill-tempered metal, which had flown out though the
strands of the cable in the tank. The fault in the cable which had
gone overboard might obviously have been caused by such a piece of
wire, and there could be no doubt that the wire of the outer covering
of the cable was capable of inflicting injury on the gutta-percha it
was intended to protect. The discovery was in some measure a relief to
men's minds, because it showed that one certainly, and the second
possibly, of the previous faults might have been the results of
similar accident. It was remarked, however, that this fault occurred
on the same watch as all the previous misfortunes had occurred.</p>
<p>"As the fault was too serious to be overlooked, and as there was a
difficulty in detecting its situation, preparations were made to get
the picking-up apparatus ready. Previous to doing so, two cuts were
made in the cable, the first near the old splice, between the main and
the fore tank (cable all right); the second cut, three miles inboard,
which showed the fault to be on that portion of the cable which was
overboard. The wire rope and the chain were now secured to the cable
forward, which showed a maximum strain of 23&#x00BD; cwt. and at 9.55,
Greenwich time, the cable was severed and went over the stern, 1186
miles having been paid out when the end splashed into the water. With
less difficulty than usual--in fact, with comparative facility--the
cable was hauled in over the bows at 10.8 am., Greenwich time. The
strain in it, according to the dynamometer, was from 50 cwt. to 55
cwt., though the latter figures represented the maximum only reached
on one occasion. We were nearly in 2000 fathoms of water; but it was
considered a favourable circumstance that we had not got a few miles
further, as we should have then been in the very deepest part of the
Atlantic plateau. As far as could be ascertained, the ship was now
over a gentle elevation, on the top of which there was only 1950
fathoms of water. The picking-up was, as usual, exceedingly tedious
and one hour and forty-six minutes elapsed before one mile was got on
board; then one of the engine's eccentric gear got out of order, so
that a man had to stand by with a handspike, aided by a wedge of wood
and an elastic band, to aid the wretched engine. Next the supply of
steam failed, and when the steam was got up it was fouud that there
was not water enough in the boilers, and so the picking-up ceased
altogether for some time, during which the ship forged ahead and
chafed against the cable.</p>
<p>"Let the reader turn his face towards a window, and imagine that he
is standing on the bows of the Great Eastern, and then, of course, on
his right will be the starboard, on his left the port side of the
ship. In front, fixed in the bows, is a large V-wheel, as it is
technically termed, with a smaller wheel of the same kind on the same
axis at each side on which the cable is drawn as it is pulled up from
the sea by the picking-up apparatus, and thence is wound under the
dynamometer and drum-wheels till it has passed the breaks and is
coiled down aft in safety. There are at the bows of the Great Eastern
two large hawsepipes, the iron rims of which project nearly a foot
beyond the line of the stem. After two miles of cable had been picked
up the Great Eastern was forced to forego the use of her engines
because the steam failed, while her vast broadside was exposed to the
wind, which was drifting her to the larboard or left-hand side, till
by degrees an oblique strain was brought to bear on the cable, which
came up from the sea to the bows on the right-side. Against one of the
hawsepipes the cable now caught on the left-hand side, while the ship
kept moving to the left, and thus chafed and strained the cable
greatly against the bow, for now it was held by this projection, and
did not drag from the V-wheel. The Great Eastern could not go astern
lest the cable should be snapped, and without motion some way there is
no power of steerage. At this critical moment, too, the wind shifted,
so as to render it more difficult to keep the head of the ship up to
the cable. As the cable then chafed so much that in two places damage
was done to it, a shackle chain and a wire rope belonging to one of
the buoys were passed down the bow over the cable and secured in a
bight below the hawsepipes. These were hauled so as to bring the
cable, which had been caught on the left-hand side by the hawsepipes,
round to the right-hand side of the bow, the ship still drifting to
the left, while the cable, now drawn directly up from the sea to the
V-wheel, was straining obliquely from the right with the shackle and
rope attached to it. It was necessary to do this instead of veering
away, as we were near the end of the cut of cable.</p>
<p>"The cable and the wire rope together were now coming in over the
bows in the groove in the larger wheel, the cable being wound upon a
drum behind by the machinery, which was once more in motion, and the
wire rope being taken in round the capstan. But the rope and cable, as
I have tried to explain, were not coming up in a right line, but were
being hauled in, with a great strain on them, at an angle from the
right-hand side, so that they did not work directly in the V in the
wheel. Still, up they came. The strain was shown on the dynamometer to
be very high, but not near breaking-point. At last, up came the cable
and wire rope shackling together on the V-wheel in the bow. They were
wound round on it, slowly, and were passing over the wheel together,
the first damaged part being inboard, when a jar was given to the
dynamometer, which flew up from 60 cwt.--the highest point
marked--with a sudden jerk, 3&#x00BD; in. In fact, the chain shackle
and wire rope clambered, as it were, up out of the groove on the
right-hand side of the V of the wheel, got on the top of the rim of
the V-wheel, and rushed down with a crash on the smaller wheel,
giving, no doubt, a severe shock to the cable to which it was
attached. The machinery was still in motion, the cable and the rope
travelled aft together, one towards the capstan, the other towards the
drum, when, just as the cable reached the dynamometer, it parted, 30
ft. from the bow, and with one bound leaped, as it were, into the
sea."</p>
<p>....Mr. Canning, the chief engineer of the work, was standing close
by. Mr. Russell goes on to say:--"It is not possible for any words to
portray the dismay with which the sight was witnessed and the news
heard. It was enough to move one to tears, and, when a man came aft
with the inner end still lashed to the chain, and we saw the tortured
strands, torn wires, and lacerated core, it is no exaggeration to say
that a strange feeling of pity, as though for some sentient creature
mutilated and dragged asunder by brutal force, passed through the
hearts of the spectators. But of what avail was sentimental
abstraction, when instant, strenuous action was demanded? Alas!
action? There, around, spread the placid Atlantic, smiling in the sun,
and not a dimple to show where lay so many hopes buried. But there was
no blank despair, and if any felt despondency they suppressed the
expression of it, while by far the greatest number of those on board
were actually animated, not by the loss itself, but by the accidental
nature of the occurrence, to indulge in sanguine expectations of
ultimate success. Captain Moriarty was just coming to the foot of the
companion to put up his daily statement of the ship's position, having
had excellent observations, when the news came. 'I fear,' he said, 'we
shall not feel much interest now in knowing how far we are from
Heart's Content.' However, it was something to know, though it was
little comfort, that we had at noon run precisely 116.4 miles since
yesterday, that 1186 miles of cable had been paid out, that we were
1062.4 miles from Valencia, 606.6 miles from Heart's Content, that we
were in lat. 51 deg. 25 min., long. 39 deg. 6 min., our course being
76 deg. S. and 25 deg. W. The Terrible was signalled 'The cable has
parted,' and was requested to bear down to us, which she did, and
came-to off our port-beam. After a brief consideration Mr. Canning,
whose presence of mind and self-possession never left him, came to the
resolution to seek for the cable in the bottom of the Atlantic, and to
get out his grapnels and drop down on it and pick it up again."</p>
<p>We must reserve till next week our...attempts made in the next few
days (unfortunately, without success) to recover the lost cable, which
was twice found and hooked, and raised a considerable way towards the
surface, but proved too heavy for the strength of the lifting
apparatus. The Great Eastern remained near the spot eight or nine
days, and then, on the 11th inst., leaving two buoys to mark the
position of the cable, turned her head back towards Europe. Her
consort, the Terrible, went on to Newfoundland. The Great Eastern, as
stated in our last, arrived at Crookhaven, on the Irish coast, on
Thursday week. She came up the Channel on Saturday last, and lay-to
off Brighton, where some of the gentlemen connected with the Atlantic
Telegraph expedition landed and hastened to London. On Sunday, about
one in the afternoon, the Great Eastern reached her old moorings at
Sheerness. Some thousands of spectators were assembled on the beach
and cheered her as she entered the port; she was greeted also with a
burst of music from the band of the Marines on board the Formidable,
the flagship, under the command of Sir Charles Talbot, the
Commander-in-Chief at Sheerness station.</p></div2>

<p>General Palmer, of Kentucky, had addressed to President Johnson an
explanatory letter with regard to the position of slavery in

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"We</hi> don't expect no good grammar here,
but you <hi rend="italic">might</hi> shut the scenes to." Such was
stated by the late Mr. G. A. &#x00E0; Beckett to have been a criticism
which he heard publicly addressed by a gentleman of the
chimney-sweeping persuasion to the manager of one of the inferior
theatres. One feels singularly inclined to adapt the remonstrance to
present circumstances, and address it to such of our American friends
as are grumbling and murmuring against England, and looking jealously
because we are exchanging courtesies with France. With such a press as
that of the States, and with universal suffrage in the hands of
persons who are led by such a press, it would be unreasonable to
expect argument, or even patient attention to the arguments of
others. But considering that five years ago all the inhabitants of the
States were "Americans," and that to censure one of them, North or
South, was to offend all; and considering that since that time a very
large portion of these Americans declared their belief that it would
be a good thing to divide the country into two parts, we may almost be
allowed to suggest that American gentlemen should settle matters among
themselves, and somehow induce the minority to assent to the views of
the majority before flying at strangers and threatening to fight them
because a few thousands here thought that seven millions there had
something to say for themselves. The American manager should "shut the
scenes to."</p>

Sumter gun was fired. May we ask them, in all good nature, whether at
that time an English writer who should have said of the smallest
Southern State what all the Northern organs are now saying of the
whole South, would not have been abused with all the force of the
press and of public oratory in all parts of the Union? Is it not
notorious that no American ever could bear to hear a single syllable
against any other American? There was never any clanship like it,
except, perhaps, in Scotland; but there are but three millions of
Scottish people, and they are supposed to be all more or less related,
so that to insult a Scot is to abuse a family. In America there were
thirty millions all bound to "crack one another up," and they did
it. In travelling, could anything be more unlike than the mode in
which an Englishman and a Yankee spoke when a countryman of either had
disgraced himself. "A smoothfaced rascal, Sir," John Bull would say,
loud enough to be heard three quarters up the table-d'h&#x00F4;te,
"and I'm glad he's come to grief. His father got his peerage by
jobbery, and the whole family is no better than it ought to be. It is
a good thing that a scandalous lot will be cleared out of the public
service." And he gave a kind o Rhadamanthine nod of approval of his
own stern justice. Not so the American in similar circumstances:--"The
kind of treatment necessary in such cases, Sir, is not rightly
apprehended except by those who live in the localities, and the
gentleman you name has made his way to affluence from very humble
beginnings, and we do not judge such a man harshly, and he has much
influence with the people." Such were the different ways in which
Englishmen and Americans were accustomed to deal with their
fellow-citizens. We do not offer an opinion as to which was the wiser
course, or whether it is better to be perfectly frank and honest and
ignore all accidental ties, or whether we should wash all our dirty
linen at home; we only wish to remind the Americans that it was only
the other day that no stranger could, without offence, hint to one of
them that another was in the wrong. And now they talk of quarrelling
with us because, at a couple of thousand miles distance, and with no
information on which we could absolutely rely, some of us were not
ready at the shortest notice to call six or seven millions of
Americans thieves, rebels, traitors, murderers, and miscreants. We
simply put the matter on the ground of fair play.</p>
<p>Then, again, let them charge us with cowardice if they will; but we
perceive another awful peril from which we have escaped. Only suppose
that things had taken a different turn, and matters had been arranged
without an appeal to the sword. Suppose that the gun from Sumter had
awakened not rage, but common-sense; and that men who spoke the
English language had unanimously exclaimed that they were not going to
kill one another for tariffs or niggers, and that a convention should
settle all disputes. We heartily wish that such a solution had been
tried. But suppose, also, that John Bull had at once given way to all
those feelings which he is now abused for lacking; and, while things
looked like war, had opened his mouth in denunciation of the wicked
slaveowners and traitors;--why, as soon as peace had been made, both
sides would have turned upon the insolent Bull, and demanded how he
dared to expect anything but a calm and rational line of conduct from
American citizens. Nations ruled and schooled by a savage aristocracy
might go to war for red and white roses, for lovelocks and roundheads,
for stars of Brunswick and Popish warming-pans; but enlightened
citizens were not so to be dragged into bloodshed. And it would have
required all the civility possessed by Earl Russell to frame
despatches to avoid a castigatory war, such as that with which we are
now menaced because some of our upper ten thousand believed what the
American press had been so long saying about the aristocratic
character of the slaveowner.</p>
<p>We certainly should be exceedingly sorry if the hatred which is
stated to be prevalent against us in the States should take the form
of actual hostility. Should it do so, we believe that it will be in
opposition to the wishes and feelings of the Government of the States
and of educated citizens. But if a nation will give universal suffrage
to the scum of all lands, that nation must be prepared to find the
intruders troublesome, and moreover, disposed to fraternise with the
lowest and most ignorant part of the home population. It is chiefly
among politicians from these classes that the anti-English feeling is
kept up, and we could hardly wish that such a population did not hate
English institutions. We are content, for the present, to believe that
the hostile sentiments, of which we hear so much, are mainly those of
the classes whom all cultivated persons hold in contempt, and whom
statesmen endeavour also to hold in subjection. And, believing this,
we have, in all good-humour, appealed to the real American citizen to
look back to what he now calls "old times," but which are not so very
old, and to remember our relations as they then were, He was so stern
in teaching us that we were not to suppose any American ever in the
wrong that he ought not to be angry with us for being slow to believe
that<pb n="187"/> seven millions of Americans are such atrocious
monsters that they ought to be exterminated, and their property (over
&#x00A3;4000) given to other American gentlemen of more correct
views. But if menace and accusation go on, we may be apter pupils than
he imagines in learning to express ourselves plainly.</p></div2>

<p>....Here, however, is a stray leaf of the "enormous gooseberry"
plant. The colour-box used by William Hogarth, I read in a daily
journal, is in the possession of a certain Colonel in Jersey city,
N.J., United States. It is so many inches square and so many inches
deep. This historical paintbox, we are told, was purchased by one of
the Colonel's English ancestors "at the sale of Hogarth's effects,
which took place in London shortly after his decease." Now, that
Hogarth's colour-box, or his palette, or his snuffbox (if he took
snuff), or his wig should be in the possession of any lady or
gentleman in America or elsewhere, is perfectly feasible. This
particular "box" story, however, loses its credibility from the fact
that no sale of William Hogarth's effects took place shortly after or
for a great many years following his death. His widow, faithful Jane
Thornhill, clave to the house in Leicester-fields, and till she
died--a very old lady indeed, almost within the memory of men still
living--sold nothing belonging to her husband, save impressions from
his engravings. John Thomas Smith, the engraver, remembered very well
going to Mrs. Hogarth to buy a copy of "The Modern Midnight
Conversation," and the widow receiving him in the front parlour, and
showing him a milkmaid's head in oil from the hand of William. "They
said he could not colour," cried the good old dame. "They lied. <hi

<p>....Another "<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> man" has made his mark in
the Thunderer this week. Mr. Frank Lawley, some time special
correspondent of that journal in the Southern States of America, has
written a long and eloquent letter on the alleged maltreatment and
starvation of Federal prisoners in Southern prisons, exculpating
Mr. Jefferson Davis and General Lee from having in any way sanctioned
the cruelties to which it was alleged the captives of the Confederate
bow and spear were subjected at Richmond and Andersonville. Touching
the whole question of the treatment of prisoners of war, North and
South, during the late conflict, I venture to hold the opinion that
there is a great deal to be said on both sides. Just this time last
year I happened to be at Saratoga, and there I was waited upon by a
deputation of Southern exiles, ladies and gentlemen, entreating me, as
an Englishman, to move public opinion in my own country with a view to
the melioration of the wretched condition of the Southern soldiers
confined in Federal prisons. Then I bought in New York a large
photographic portrait of a Northern "bhoy," recently released from
captivity in the Libby prison, and who, by insufficient food, had been
reduced literally to the condition of a skeleton; but photographs as
painful might have been taken, I am afraid, of desperate cases of
atrophy in the Lincoln Hospital at Washington.....</p>
<p>In which I am reminded of another "live Yankee," as droll in his
way, in reality, as Sam slick was in fiction.  I have the pleasure to
inform my readers that "Artemus Ward" is coming, and that very
speedily.  He wrote me the other day from Buffalo, N.Y., introducing
an American gentleman whom I should have been delighted to welcome,
but whom, owing to my being at the period of his visit in the interior
of Africa, I unfortunately missed. "I shall be with you soon," quoth
Artemus, "with my Mormons and things." The "Mormons and things," in
the shape of a lecture on Great Salt Lake City, were found
irresistibly comical in the States. I wonder whether they would be
appreciated, here. We are so hard to please; and yet, if the public
roar vith laughter at "Mrs. Brown at the Play," they surely ought to
scream with hilarity at the sayings of the drollest lecturer I ever
listened to. On the whole, I should advise A. W. to put on "a clean
biled rag," which is Artemisian for a clean shirt, and cross the
Atlantic. If his Mormons and things don't take, he will be at least
enabled to study some English peculiarities of which he can make good
use when he returns to the U.S.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH EXPEDITION.</p>
<p>....We now...quote, from the authorised journal of the exedition, a
narrative of the subsequent attempts to find and raise the cable, at a
depth of 2000 fathoms; the locality being, as stated, in latitude 51
deg. 25 min., longitude 39 deg. 6 min., which is distant 1062 miles
from Valencia, Ireland, and 606 miles from Heart's Content Bay,
Newfoundland--the nearest parts respectively of the European and
American shores. Immediately after the breaking of the cable,
Mr. Canning, the chief engineer, resolved to try and pick it up again
from the bottom of the Atlantic. This might have seemed a hopeless
task:--</p>
<p>"But, then," says Mr. Russell, in his journal, "what would they say
in England if not even an attempt, however desperate, had been made?
There were men on board who had picked up broken cables from the
Mediterranean full 600 fathoms down. The weather was beautiful, and,
although there were no soundings, and the depth beneath us was matter
of conjecture, it was settled that the Great Eastern should steam ten
or twelve miles to windward and eastward of the position in which she
was when the cable went down, out with the grapnels and wire rope, and
drift down across the track in which the cable was supposed to be
lying. Although all utterance of hope was suppressed and no word of
confidence escaped the lips, both were treasured in the fancy. The
doctrine of chances could not touch such a contingency as we had to
speculate upon. And now came forth the grapnels--two five-armed
anchors, with flukes, sharply curved and tapering to an oblique,
toothlike end, the hooks with which the engineer was going to fish
from the Great Eastern for a take worth, with all its belongings, more
than a million. The ship stood away some thirteen or fourteen miles
from the spot where the accident occurred, and then lay-to in smooth
water, with the Terrible in company. The grapnels, weighing three
cwt., shackled and secured to a length of wire buoy-rope, of which
there were five miles on board (breaking strain calculated at ten
tons), was brought up to the bows, and at 3.20, ship's time, was
thrown over and 'whistled through' the sea a prey to fortune. At first
the iron sank but slowly, but soon the momentum of descent increased
so as to lay great stress on the picking-up machinery now rendered
available to lowering the novel messenger we were sending down armed
with warrant of search for the fugitive hidden in mysterious caverns
beneath. Length flew after length over cog-wheel and drum till the
iron wires, warming with work, heated at last so as to convert the
water thrown upon the machinery into clouds of steam. The time passed
heavily indeed. All life had died out in the vessel, and no noise was
heard except the dull grating of the wire cable over the wheels at the
bows. The most apathetic and indifferent would have sacrificed much to
have heard the rumble of the cable again, and esteemed it the most
grateful music in the world. The electricians' room was closed, all
their subtle apparatus stood functionless, and cell-zinc and copper
threw off superfluous currents in the silent chamber of science. Away
flew the wire strands, length after length--ocean was indeed
insatiable--'More!' and 'More!' cried the daughter of horseleech from
the black night of waters and still the rope descended. One thousand
fathoms--fifteen hundred fathoms--two thousand fathoms--hundreds again
mounting up, till at last, at 5.6 p.m., the strain was diminished, and
at 2500 fathoms, or 15,000 feet, the grapnel reached the bed of the
Atlantic and set to its task of finding and holding the cable. Where
that lay was, of course, beyond human knowledge; but, as the ship
drifted down across its course, there was -ust a sort of head-shaking
surmise that the grapnel might catch it--that the ship might feel
it--that the iron rope might be brought up again, and that the cable,
if across it, might--here was the most hazardous hitch of all--come up
without breaking."</p>
<p>....The cable was grappled three times--namely, on the 3rd, the
7th, and again the 11th of August; it was lifted each time a
considerable way from the bottom; but the grapnels, ropes, and lifting
machinery were not sufficient to bring it to the surface. The
different places at which the cable was thus taken hold of were
several miles apart. On the first occasion, Aug. 3, the grapnel having
been let down overnight as above described, they began to haul in the
rope early in the morning:--</p>
<p>"At eight o'clock 300 fathoms were in, and it became evident to all
on board that the grapnel was holding on and lifting 'something' from
the bottom. And what could that something be but the cable? The
scientific men calculated the strain and determined it could not be
from the wire rope and grapnel solely, and it could only be inferred
then that, as the bottom of the Atlantic is free from rocks here, and
as the depth at which the rope began to resist agreed with the
supposed soundings, it had really grappled the prize. Presently the
spur wheel of the picking-up apparatus broke, and the operation of
taking in the rope became dangerous as well as difficult, for it flew
up at times with such force as to knock down those near it, and one of
the most valuable of Mr. Canning's staff received a severe cut on the
cheek, and another had an ugly injury inflicted on his face from that
cause. The weather, which had been very thick and hazy, now settled
down into a dense fog, and we lost sight of the Terrible; but the
conviction that the cable was really once more attached to the Great
Eastern, no matter how precariously, and no matter how far off,
afforded too much cause for congratulation, conjecture, and suspense
to allow much room for other thoughts. There was a chance--just a
chance--that the cable might be dragged up from the deep; and every
hundred fathom of hawser handed in over the bows was joyously
recorded, and marked as an additional step in the march of this
forlorn hope. The hawser toiled and pulled as if it were a living
thing, and struck out at a considerable angle from the bows as if it
were towed by some giant force underneath and away from the
steamer. When 500 fathoms were in-board, the most sceptical admitted
the cable must be on the iron hooks, and anxiety and suspense rose
higher just as the probability of recovering the cable became less
wild, But at 3.20, ship's time, all our fears and hopes were abruptly
ended. The drum flew round rapidly, the tail of the rope flourished in
the air as it flew in-board, and with a light splash the other end
dived into the Atlantic. One of the iron swivels had yielded to the
strain. The rope used was divided into lengths of 100 fathoms, each
having a shackle at the end with a heavy iron swivel. The head of the
bolt of one of these had been drawn right through the iron collar as
900 fathoms had been secured. Not a moment was lost in deciding what
measures to pursue. It was rather encouraging than the reverse to have
made the trial so abruptly concluded; for it was demonstrated that the
grapnel could pick up the cable in more than 2000 fathoms, and the
only question now was whether the wire rope, or the cable itself,
would bear the purchase and weight of hauling up from such vast
depths. There was wire rope enough left to make another attempt to
save the cable. It was resolved that the best course to pursue would
be to steam to a point two miles eastward of the extreme end of the
cable, so as to have only a mile or so of cable to lift up in the
bight when the ship drifted over it, as the broken part would, it was
hoped, in coming up on the grapnel twist round the other portion of
the cable. Captain Anderson prepared to run fourteen or fifteen miles
back, and drift down as nearly as possible across the line of the
cable. A fog came on that afternoon and the Great Eastern lay for the
night in a smooth sea. Next day she drifted thirty-four miles, which,
with twelve miles steamed, made forty-six miles from the position
where the cable parted. It was resolved to make a raft on which to
place a buoy to slip over with 2&#x00BD; miles of the cable itself
attached to a mushroom anchor, as soon as we had reached the spot
where they had grappled the cable the day before. When the Great
Eastern arrived at the place estimated she dropped the buoy, which has
a red flag above a black ball fastened to the staff and anchors, and
steamed off again. The fog continued all next day and the day after,
so that nothing could be done; the ship still drifted about. On
Monday, the 7th, between eleven and twelve o'clock, the weather having
cleared, the grapnel, with 2500 fathoms of cable, was hove over. We
again quote the journal:--"So much was the machinery improved that the
grapnel was only half the time in reaching the bottom, and very soon
the diminution of the strain on the dynamometer showed that it was
resting on the ooze. The day turned out most favourable, a steady
breeze from the north drifting the ship towards the cable at the rate
of a mile an hour, broadside on. At noon excellent observations were
taken, which put our position at lat. 51.27, long. 38.42. For several
hours the grapnel dragged the bottom without obstruction, the
dynamometer indicated a varying resistance to its progress. At 6.15
the strain increased from 45 cwt. to 48 cwt., and soon began to rise
steadily towards 55 cwt., and thence to 60 cwt. Presently the anxious
eyes which were fixed on the compass and on the head of the Great
Eastern observed a very slight tendency in her head to come round to
the wind. It was slow--very slow indeed. The ship seemed loth to
notice the influence to which she was becoming plainly subjected,
disdaining the feeble clue which solicited her attention to the
labyrinth of cable beneath; but in an hour and a half she came round
from E.by S. &#x00BD;S. to E. &#x00B7;N. The strain was greater every
moment. There could be no longer any doubt. The cable was caught
again. Here was a triumph of seamanship and perseverance. The ship's
head was brought round to the wind by the screw, and the capstan
engine was set to work to aid the new machinery of the picking-up gear
to haul up the cable. The strain ran up to 66 cwt., and, at eight
p.m. the ill-fated machinery broke down at the bow, and a slight delay
occurred, but the main part of the waste being transferred to the
capstain, the rope was steadily hauled in at the rate of 150 fathoms
per hour." At half-past eleven 300 fathoms were hauled in. All seemed
going on hopefully till next morning. Between five and six a.m. the
dynamometer rose from 82 cwt. to 85 cwt., and thence to 87 cwt., and
it was calculated that the grapnel with the cable was then rising from
the bottom. The rope had come on steadily at an average of 150 fathoms
an hour during the night:--"At 7.30 am, there was a strong expression
of confidence in our success, and great gladness on board. The one
mile mark was hauled in, and we had demonstrated the fact that a ship
could pick up a cable in 2500 fathoms of water and pull it one mile
from the bottom. The cable was now suspended 1500 fathoms, or one mile
and a half below us in ocean. We had signalled the good news to the
Terrible. In an instant more, whilst our flags were still flying, all
was over. One of the shackles and swivels which join each length of
wire rope to the other had come over the bow, had passed over the
drum, and was in the third round of rope taken in by the capstan, when
the head of the swivel-pin gave way, and quick as lightning, the end
flourishing the iron shackle like a mailed fist in the air right and
left, as if menacing with death the hardy enemy who dared stand in its
desperate way, glanced aloft and leapt exultingly into the sea, to
join the cable and the 1500 fathoms of wire rope which still hung from
the grapnel. Now all these shackles and swivels had been examined
minutely before they were put over, and every care taken to prevent
the recurrence of accident which had already frustrated our
exertions. The work was of Brown, Lennox, and Co.--no better names;
the strain was not near that put down as the breaking point, and yet
there was the painful result. The news was signalled to the Terrible,
and her answer had not long been flown when her boat put off with
Lieutenant Prowse to learn what course we were about to pursue. At
9.50 a second buoy, secured on a raft and casks, was lowered with 2500
fathoms of telegraph cable moored to a broken spar wheel. It carries a
black ball at the end of a staff, and below the ball floats a flag,
red, white, and red, in three horizontal bars. The buoy floats low,
and has been let go as close as possible to the spot where the grapnel
rope sank. If these buoys do not break adrift they will be of great
service when a renewed attempt is made to lift the cable."</p>
<p>....These two buoys...are about ten miles apart. The one...(that
most deeply sunk in the water) is moored with nearly two miles and one
third of the electric telegraph cable attached to the "mushroom
anchor," and marks, as nearly as could be calculated, the spot where
the Atlantic cable broke and sank on the 2nd of August. This buoy was
lowered in lat. 51 deg. 28 min., long. 38 deg. 42 min....on the 4th of
August; and it bears at the top, in white letters, the word "<hi
rend="smallcaps">Telegraph</hi>. No. 5." The other buoy...was moored
on the 8th of August, and marks the spot where the wire hawser used
for the grapnel broke on the second occasion of the attempt at
grappling the cable. As the buoy first put down had been found to sink
low in the water, though based upon three tiers of timber logs, on the
occasion of launching the second buoy, the raft was made larger; and
four barrels, securely bunged, were lashed to the angles of the raft,
giving thereby greatly-increased buoyancy and height out of the
water. The flag of the first buoy is scarlet and the ball is under the
flag. The flag of the second buoy has three bars--scarlet, white, and
scarlet--and the ball is over the flag.</p>
<p>The next day was employed in readjusting and fortifying the
picking-up machinery and the grapnel tackle. The anchor capstan was
enlarged and strengthened also, with huge beams of oak and an iron
casing all around it, forming a huge drum of twice the diameter of the
ordinary capstan, for winding in the wire rope and great hawsers more
rapidly than they could have been wound on a less diameter; while the
"slack" was to be taken from this drum as fast as it accumulated, and
passed along a line of men to the place where it was to be coiled on
deck....<pb n="223"/>A party of the men on deck, near the bow end of
the ship, arrang[ed] the coils of rope previous to lowering the
grapnel for the last time, on the 11th of August. It had been lowered
the day before, but had failed to catch the cable. The rope and
grapnel having been hauled back next morning, preparations were made
for the next and final attempt.</p>
<p>"All the damaged rope was rejected and repaired as far as the means
at the disposal of Mr. Canning permitted. A line, consisting of 1600
fathoms of wire rope, 220 fathoms of hemp rope, and 510 fathoms of
Manila, was prepared and carefully examined, of which 1760 fathoms was
pronounced good, the rest being rather suspicious. At 7.25 a.m. the
Great Eastern was alongside No. 2 buoy, the Terrible in company. At
11.30 the Great Eastern signalled the Terrible, 'We are going to make
a final effort,' and then, 'We are sorry you have had such
uncomfortable waiting.' The ship's head being W. by S., and the buoy
No. 2 bearing E. by N. about two miles, the grapnel was let go at 1.56
p.m., Greenwich time. The wind would drift the Great Eastern to N.E.,
right across the cable, and fore and aft canvas was set to overcome
the current. The grapnel soon touched the bottom, as the new machinery
enabled the men to pay out the rope at the rate of fifty fathoms a
minute. For some time the ship drifted onwards, but at 3.50 p.m.,
ship's time, the strain on the rope rose to 60 cwt. as it came in over
the bows, though it was taken easily by the new capstan improvements
effected by Mr. Clifford. The ship's head varied from W.N.W. to W. by
S., and as the rope came in the screw was set quietly to work at times
to keep it to the wind, which had increased somewhat, accompanied by
showers of rain. The dynamometer index rose higher and higher, till it
reached 80 cwt., and once, as a shackle came through, the machinery
flew up to 105 cwt. It was a certainty that the Atlantic cable had
been caught for the third time, and was fast held in the grapnel
coming up from its oozy bed. Is there need to say that the
alternations of hope and fear which agitated all on board reached
their climax? There was an intensity of quiet excitement among us,
such as men feel when they await some supreme decree. Some remained
below; others refused to go forward, where the least jar of the
machinery put their hearts in their mouths; Others walked in the
saloon or upon the after-deck abstractedly. In the bows, Captain
Anderson, Mr. Canning, Mr. Clifford, and their men toiled on; and
thence came constant signals, through an acoustic tube and whistle, to
the bridge to go ahead, with the screw, or to stop, as the strain on
the dynamometer indicated. Suddenly we heard the whistle and a cry of
'Stop it!' from the bow; and exclamations of grief and regret told us
our last bolt had been sped. At 9.40 p.m., Greenwich time, as 765
fathoms had been got in, a shackle on the hemp hawser passed through
the machinery, and m a moment afterwards the rope parted near the
capstan and flew over the bow with a whistling rush which carried
death with it like the march of a round shot. In all the crowd of
labourers not one was touched, because the men held onto their
stoppers and kept the end straight; but the danger appeared so great
that with the shout 'It is gone!' mingled the eager demand from
Mr. Canning and others who rushed to the bow, 'Is anyone hurt?'
'None.' But there lay the cable beneath us once more, buried under
coils of rope and wire, to which, in an instant, had just been added
1750 fathoms more. Signal was at once made to the Terrible. Orders
were given to get up steam in all haste to leave the disastrous
spot."</p>
<p>The return voyage of the Great Eastern has been described. She was
lying off Brighton on Saturday week....We earnestly hope that next
year, when this machinery will again be put in use, the laying of the
Atlantic telegraph will be accomplished with the utmost facility and
safety.</p></div2>

<p>By reports from the American Consuls at Bremen and Hamburg it
appears that during the first six months of 1865 about 34,600
emigrants left those ports for the United States. This is a large

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Submarine Cables</hi>.--In Europe, Asia,
Africa, and Australia there are fifty-two submarine cables, which are
of the aggregate length of 5625 miles, and the insulated wires of
which measure 9783 miles. The longest of these is 1550 fathoms, and
the shortest 1&#x00BD; fathom. There are ninety-five submarine cables
in the United States and British North America, which measure
sixty-eight miles, and their insulated wires 133 miles. The overland
telegraph line between New York and the west coast of Ireland, through
British Columbia, Northern Asia, and Russia will be 20,479 miles long,
12,740 miles of which are completed. It has at length been resolved
that this line shall cross from America to Asia at the southern point
of Norton Sound, on the American side to St. Lawrence Island, and
thence to Cape Thadeus on the Asiatic continent. Two submarine cables
will be required for this--one 135 miles long and the other 250 miles
long. Cape Thadeus is 1700 miles from the mouth of the Amoor
River. The following are some of the submarine cables in operation,
with their length in statute miles, viz.:--Dover said Calais, 27
miles; Denmark, across the Belt, 18 miles; Dover and Ostend,
80&#x00BD; miles; Firth of Forth, 6 miles; Portpatrick and Donaghadee,
25 miles; across River Tay, 2 miles; Portpatrick and Whitehead, 27
miles; Sweden and Denmark, 12 miles; Italy and Corsica, 110 miles;
Corsica and Sardinia, 10 miles; Egypt, 10 miles; Italy and Sicily, 5
miles; Newfoundland and Cape Breton, 85 miles; Prince Edward Island
and New Brunswick, 12 miles; Strait of Canso and Cape Breton, N.S.,
1&#x00BD; mile; Norway, across fiords, 49 miles; across months of
Danube, 3 miles; Ceylon and mainland of India, 30 miles; England and
Holland, 140 miles; England and Hanover, 280 miles; Norway, across
fiords, 16 miles; South Australia and King's Island, 140 miles;
Alexandria, 2 miles; England and Denmark, 368 miles; Sweden and
Gothland, 64 miles; Folkestone and Boulogne, 24 miles; across rivers
in India, 10 miles; Malta and Sicily, 60 miles; England and the Isle
of Man, 36 miles; Suez and Jubal Island, 220 miles; Jersey and Pireu,
in France, 21 miles; Tasmania and Bass Strait, 240 miles; Denmark and
Great Belt, 28 miles; Dacca and Pegu, 116 miles; Barcelona and Mahon,
180 miles; Minorca and Majorca, 35 miles; Iveza and Majorca, 74 miles;
St. Antonio and Iviza, 76 miles; Norway, across fiords, 16 miles;
Toulon and Corsica, 195 miles; Holyhead and Howth, 64 miles; Malta and
Alexandria, 1535 miles; Newhaven and Dieppe, 80 miles; Pembroke,
Wales, and Wexford, 63 miles; Sardinia and Sicily, 243 miles; Otranto
and Avalona, 62 miles; Faho and Kurrachee, 1450 miles; Sweden and
Prussia, 55 miles; and Algiers and Sicily, 259 miles. The oldest
submarine cable has been-working fourteen years and the youngest about
six months. The largest number of conductors is nine and the smallest
one. The lowest depth of water is in the case of the Toulon and
Corsica, which is 1550 fathoms; and the next the Barcelona and Mahon,
1400 fathoms, until they reach about fourteen fathoms of
water.</p></div2>

<p>Since 1847 above 3,000,000 immigrants have landed at New York. From
Jan. 1 to Aug. 1, this year, 110 steamers and 116 sailing ships
conveyed thither 96,425 persons. As a general rule, says a New York
paper, German emigrants bring most baggage and Irish emigrants
least.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 26th ult.</p>
<p>The commission for trying Captain Wirtz on charges of conspiring,
with other Southern leaders, to murder Federal prisoners, and with
having actually murdered several, was set aside dcring the trial, and
a new commission substituted, omitting the names of Generals Lee,
Seddon, and Northrop. Wirtz's counsel objected to fresh proceedings,
and asked for time to prepare the defence. Eventually, however, he
abandoned the case. The President of the Court then appointed the
Judge-Advocate to defend Wirtz. Charges of horrible cruelty are made
against him, among others, "that he kept bloodhounds to hunt down
prisoners of war escaped from his custody, and that he caused several
of the prisoners to be inoculated with poisonous matter."</p>
<p>The Mississippi Convention has repealed the Secession ordinance,
and all others, except the revenue one, passed during the war. It has
passed the State constitutional amendment for the abolition of
slavery, and has memorialised President Johnson to pardon
Mr. Davis. President Johnson telegraphed to the Governor of
Mississippi, congratulating him on the progress made by that State
towards readmission to the Union. He also said that the Habeas Corpus
Act would be restored and the troops withdrawn as soon as the State
had progressed sufficiently to have returned to her allegiance.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Democratic Convention has given Mr. Johnson its
qualified support. It demands that measures shall be passed to give
the South immediate congressional representation and to save them from
negro suffrage.</p>
<p>The American ironclad fleet has nearly all been ordered out of
commission and is to be laid up at League Island, on the Delaware
River, a few miles below Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The steamer Brother Jonathan, from San Francisco for Portland, was
wrecked near Cape Lincoln. She had from 200 to 300 passengers on
board, who were all lost with the exception of fifteen.</p>
<p>Ford's Theatre, at Washington, is being converted into a fire-proof
building, in which all the captured archives of the Southern
Confederacy will be kept. They will be under the charge of Dr. Francis
Lieber, of New York.</p>
<p>Mr. William Cullen Bryant has purchased the homestead, in his
native town, of Cummington, Hampshire county, Mass., and is refitting
it for a summer residence. He has been spending part of the summer
there.</p>

<p>Advices from Quebec to Aug. 26 state that in the Canadian House of
Commons, on Mr. Galt moving that the House do go into Committee of
Supply, Mr. Holton made an important amendment relative to the
enlargement of the St. Lawrence Canals, in connection with the
Reciprocity Treaty with the United States. After a long debate, in
which the Reciprocity Treaty and the scheme of the Confederacy was
fully discussed, the amendment was negatived by a vote of 78 to
20.</p></div2>
