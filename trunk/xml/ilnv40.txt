<p>And here it becomes necessary to infuse into our domestic chronicle
a foreign element. The disruption of the United States of America in
the spring, and the consequent civil war, has had an obvious bearing
on our interests and our policy. The path of neutrality and of
non-interference has been a narrow and a difficult one for our
statesmen to tread, owing to circumstances over which England has no
control, and to which we do not think it necessary now to do more than
allude. Unhappily, the affair of the Trent has left us in such a
position that on the first day of the new year we were anxiously
awaiting intelligence which would bear with it the issues of peace or
war with a kindred people. At this point it will not be out of place
to advert to the attitude which France has adopted towards this
country, one of loyal alliance and coincidence of opinion, which,
spontaneously expressed, has been followed by Austria and Prussia,
and, therefore, may be said to have gained the acceptance of the
majority of the Great Powers of Europe. Nor should we pass over the
remarkable signs which are apparent of a new era in the administration
of the affairs of France, taking a direction which can be traced to
the insensible influence of England; while the expansion of our trade
with our nearest neighbour, owing to the recent arrangements between
the two countries, has been such as to promise almost to compensate
for the, we trust temporary, loss of our commercial dealings wit 
h America.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Africa we have news from New York to the 10th
ult. This steamer was detained for thirty-six hours by Lord Lyons in
order to take out dispatches [sic].</p>

<p rend="center">HOW THE NEWS FROM EUROPE WAS RECEIVED.</p>

<p>The steam-ship Europa arrived at Halifax on the morning of Sunday,
Dec. 15, bringing European advices to Dec. 2. A very full summary of
the opinions of the English press on the Mason end Slidell case, and
the important decision of the British Government as well as the
opinion of the law officers of the Crown, was telegraphed to New York
and Washington, where the news was received on Sunday afternoon. No
journals were published, however, on Sunday; but the nature of the
news gained currency through private circles, and caused intense
excitement-the more so as the previous advices per Hansa had led the
public to believe that there would be no difficulty with England on
this question.</p>
<p>A full telegraphic summary was published in the American journals
of Monday, Dec. 16, and the Mason and Slidell case became the
absorbing topic of the day. The press and the public generally seem to
deprecate war with England, and to cling to a vague idea that the
matter would be settled by some diplomatic arrangement. Unanimity at
first, however, appeared to prevail among the press and public upon
the most important part of the question-namely, the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and the universal opinion was that the
"national honour" of the country could never permit the surrender of
the prisoners under any circumstances whatever.</p>
<p>The following day, Dec. 17, the feeling universally was much calmer
and quieter throughout all circles, and the general opinion was that
war would certainly not ensue; the idea of giving up Messrs. Mason and
Slidell was even discussed, and its probability entertained, the
argument being, if the Federal Government was in the wrong in taking
these men, there is no disgrace in surrendering them; and if they were
right, the questioncan be discussed or settled by arbitration.</p>
<p>The Europa's mails were delivered in New York Dec. 18, and their
contents closely scrutinized[sic]. Captain Seymour, Queen's messenger,
and Mr. Cooke, messenger from Mr. Adams, arrived in New York on the
morning of Dec. 18, and at once left for Washington by special train,
where they arrived at midnight.</p>
<p>The tone of the New York morning journals of Dec. 18 was materially
changed on the Mason and Slidell question, and a degree of moderation
was observable in discussing the subject very different from the articles of the few previous weeks.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th news from England to Dec. 6 was
telegraphed from Portland, and the announcement of the formidable
warlike progress being made in Great Britain again created great excitement.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EFFECT ON THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES.</p> 

<p>The bankers began to discuss the propriety of suspending cash
payments, and held a meeting immediately to come to a decision
thereupon. The New York Bank statement of the 16th showed that a large
decrease of their stock of specie (to the amount of nearly 5,000,000
dols.) had taken place, although there had been no shipments to
Europe. It was perceived that hoarding had commenced; nevertheless,
the banks of the three chief cities agreed to continue for the present
to meet their obligations in coin if demanded.</p>

<p>In the Stock Market there was a general fall of about three per
cent, and in some instances of from five to six per cent. Sterling
exchange rose to 111. In the Produce Market saltpetre advanced to
15c. per pound; and at the public sales brimstone, tea, and coffee
were withdrawn.</p>

<p>On the 18th Secretary Chase arrived in New York, and was closeted
with the bankers all day. What passed at the interview was studiously
concealed from the public except that Mr. Chase assured the bankers
that the demands of England would not be made an occasion of war by
the Cabinet of Washington.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON</p>

<p>Lord Lyons had not had any interview with the Secretary of State up
to the hour of the steamer's leaving; but the American Cabinet had had
several protracted sittings, the spirit of which, according to public
rumour, tended towards a peaceful settlement. It is observed that the
Ambassadors of England, France, and Prussia did not attend the
President's levee.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The proceedings of this body have been important, both in a
domestic and international point of view. Mr. Lovejoy's motion
censuring General Halleck for his order forbidding slaves to enter his
camp was defeated in the House by 78 against 64. This is regarded as a
triumph of the Administrative and Conservative Republicans over the
Emancipationists. In the Senate a motion to inquire into the conduct
of the Secretary of State in causing the arrest of persons in the
loyal States was defeated by 25 against 17. The bill to grant 1000
dols. to the owners of the British ship Perthshire, for wrongful
detention, was passed by the House. Mr. Cox, in introducing the
measure, said "that the prompt action of Congress in awarding it as
intended as an earnest to Great Britain that this Government will he
as earnest to indemnify for a wrong as to defend a right." On the
16th, Mr. Vallandingham, of Ohio, a pro-slavery Democrat, introduced
resolutions calling upon the President to maintain the stand already
taken in regard to Captain Wilke's action, and pledging to him the
full support of the House in vindicating the courage of the Government
and people of the United Stairs against a foreign Power. He moved the
previous question, but the resolutions were referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs by a vote of 109 against 16, the mover and his
seconders voting in the negative. Nothing has yet been done by either
House towards carrying out the recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury concerning the emission of a national currency in lieu of the
bank-notes now in use.</p> 

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federal armies have made no movement of importance during the
week. The popularity of M'Clellan is decidedly on the wane. Ship
Island, at the mouth of the Mississippi, has been occupied by the
Federals. Neither General Burnside's expedition nor that which has
been organized [sic] to descend the Mississippi had yet sailed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>A terrible fire had broken out in Charleston, attributed to negro
incendiarism. Five hundred and seventy-six building were consumed,
including a majority of the churches and public buildings. The loss is
set down at 7,000,000 dollars. The case has been brought before the
Confederate Congress by a special message from President Davis, and a
sum of 250,000 dollars appropriated to the relief of the sufferers.</p>

<p>In Nashville gold is at a premium of 40, and silver of 35, per cent.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>

<p>Public opinion in Canada supports the stand taken by the British
Government. The Canadian papers brought by the American mail are full
of military news. Preparations for war are being made on all hands,
and volunteering is being carried on with admirable spirit.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Renter's office
yesterday (Friday)</p>

<p> A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICA</hi>.-New York, Dec. 20,
Afternoon.-(Per Anglo-Saxon, vi&#x00E2; Portland and Londonderry.)A
battle is reported to have taken place in Missouri in which 1500
Confederates, finding themselves surrounded by the Federal forces,
surrendered with their baggage and equipments. Reports are current
that the Confederates have evacuated Galveston. 120,000lb. of
sea-island cotton have arrived at New York from Beaufort:
400,000lb. more are reported ready to be shipped. Vice-President
Stephens, of the Southern Confederacy, is said to be seriously
ill. The projected Federal expedition under General Villes from
Beaufort has been abandoned. A treaty between America and Mexico is
reported to have been subjected to Congress, by which the Federal
Government agrees to pay Mexico 11,000,000 dollars to refund the
British and French claims. Mexico is to grant America commercial
privileges and permission to transport troops across the Mexican
territory.</p>

Lord Lyons has had several informal interviews with Mr. Seward, but
that no official communication on the subject of the Trent affair has
yet passed between them. It is rumoured [sic] that Mr. Seward sent a
communication to the British Government previous to the receipt of the
Europa's advice. The belief in a pacific solution is universal. The
New York <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> and <hi

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">OFF</hi>.-On Wednesday the emigration
officials at Liverpool issued their annual returns of the emigration
from that port during the past year. At the beginning of the present
year, and indeed up to May, there was every promise that the exodus
from this port would equal, if not surpass, that of any previous
year. In May, however, the American crisis assumed a serious aspect,
and the emigration all at once dropped off; and from that period up to
the present time there has been a regular and continued decrease, and
now the emigration trade of the port is at a complete
standstil1. Ships that formerly carried out their 500 to 700
passengers can now scarcely raise two dozen- indeed, brokers will
scarcely take the trouble of having a vessel surveyed by the
Emigration Commissioners, though the expense so trifling. The number
of vessels sailing under the Act, or Government supervision, and
number of passengers they carried, see as follows:-To the United
States, 139 vessels, of 220,213 tons burden, carried 1365 cabin and
26,212 steerage passengers; to Canada, seven vessels, 6720 tons,
carried 124 cabin and 1005 steerage passengers; to New South Wales,
two ships, 2344 tons, 526 steerage passengers; to Victoria, thirty
ships, 49,326 tons, 465 cabin and 9090 steerage passengers; to South
America, one ship, 287 tons, 8 cabin and 81 steerage passengers making
a total of 179 ships, and 38,879 passengers. Of ships not under the
Act, 348 carried to various parts of the world 6761 cabin and 9387
steerage passengers-16,148 passengers in all. Thus the total number of
passengers sailing under the Act was 38,879; and not under the Act,
16,148: 55,027 in all. Of these, 11,591 were English; 20,343 Irish;
2071 Scotch: the remainder belonged to other countries. In 1860 there
sailed under the Act 255 ships, 381,650 tons, 2796 cabin passengers
and 65,487 steerage passengers, or 68,283 passengers. In the same year
there left 15,491 passengers "not under the Act." Another feature of
this enormous decrease is, that whereas in former years people made
remittances to this country in order to assist their friends "at home"
to emigrate to the States, affairs are now reversed, and money is
forwarded through agents to bring people from America. The tide of
emigration to Australia flows slowly but steadily, and has hardly
received any impetus from the deranged state of American affairs.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, 8ATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 4, 1862.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> events of the year having been
summarised [sic] in another part of our Impression, we have now to
complete the record by adding the latest news from the only part of
the world where events have at the moment a strong interest for
English readers. The arrival of the Africa places us in possession of
a large mass of details, which our contemporaries have sought to
arrange ingeniously, mosaic fashion, so as to present a picture of the
American mind with reference to the dispute with England. We do not
know, however, that the picture is a likeness, clever as is the
manipulation of material out of which it has been produced. The only
part which has, we think, been "reliably" (to use a vile word)
presented is that which indicates the surprise which has seized the
States at the attitude of this country. We have submitted so long, and
with such good-natured forbearance, to every caprice, whim, and
impertinence of our cousins that they had, not perhaps unreasonably,
concluded that we had lost sight of the truth that under some
circumstances patience ceases to be a virtue. We have shown, in
contradiction to the incessant allegations of the Transatlantic press,
that we did, understand America and the nature of American
institutions; and that, though ourselves working with a responsible
Government, mutually dependent, and resting on the opinion of the
intellectual and solvent classes of society, we could make all
allowances for the difficult position of a Government under the
dictation of mobs, and abandoned by the culpable selfishness of the
respectable population. But the last outrage has been so flagrant that
not only is England aroused, but all the strong Governments of
Europe-some of them little inclined to be friendly to us- exclaim with
united voice that such a thing cannot be borne; and the intimation of
Earl Russell that there is a limit to our forbearance, though such
notification was a matter of indisputable necessity, has astonished
the Americans. The various utterances of the journals are not worth
collecting, except in so far as they reflect the opinion of the
peoples or may be supposed to be acceptable to it. The better men in
the States are said to have recognized [sic] the justice of our
demand, the Commander of the Army (at whom the Democratic party is
said to cast strange glances, as at a future Dictator who shall put
down the Abolitionists) having at once declared, it is alleged, that
Mr. Lincoln must restore the Commissioners and apologise [sic] to
England. But the formal delivery of the English demand would seem not
to have taken place when the Africa's bag was sealed. The Congress, so
ready the other day with a sycophantic compliment to Captain Wilks,
had refused by 109 to 16 to back up his "action" any further, and had
referred the question to the Government itself. Mr. Chase, the
American Gladstone, had assured the representatives of the financial
interest that the dispute would receive a speedy and pacific
solution. So far, therefore, things may be said to look a little
better; but it would be worse than foolish to augur that the danger of
war has passed away. We wish that we could believe the Seward party
wise enough and patriotic enough to consider the question only on its
merits. They have never given any proof of such a statesmanlike
disposition. They have sought nothing but popularity and the applause
of that part of the populace whose good opinion to a reproach to
honest men. Meantime they are being hard pressed by the Abolitionists,
who are more in earnest than any other section of the American public,
and who, naturally, are indignant that the slavery-hating Englishman
is placed in such a situation that he cannot sympathise [sic] with the
enemies of the slaveowner. It is hinted that the Abolitionists me much
more active hostility to the Government, and already the alarmists on
the Seward side threaten the severest reprisals. With such foes close
upon them, and with the discontent which the impatient mob is showing
at the prudential inactivity of General M'Clellan (there were idiots,
even in the London Common Council, who assailed Lord Wellington in the
same way for his unmatched Peninsular tactics), and with a fearful
expenditure to provide for out of an almost empty treasury, the
position of the divided and intriguing Cabinet of Mr. Lincoln is far
from enviable. This is to be much regretted, because the fact may make
it impossible for the President to do what justice and true wisdom
dictate in regard to England. He may feel himself obliged to make
political capital, and refuse to yield the men, at the risk of
bringing down prompt chastisement from the armed hand of England. A
brilliant victory over the South at this moment would be the best
guarantee for peace between us and the Americans-the national vanity
would be appeased and prudent counsels would have a chance of
prevailing. But there is small hope of anything of the kind; General
M'Clellan adheres to the Fabian system; and, though he counsels
justice, he takes no steps to do what alone would make justice
tolerated. In this, of course, we have no right to blame him. If his
own views of the future are such as are imputed to him-and if they are
he is far too wise a man to give any sign of the kind-he may not be
displeased to see the Government embarrassed by enemies whom it may be
his mission to put down. Thus the matter rests until fresh advices
arrive; and we repeat that the utmost that the last dispatches [sic]
permit us to say is, that the Americans are surprised at our energetic
protest against outrage, and seem inclined to consider that we may
have good grounds for action.</p>

<p>(<hi rend="smallcaps">From our Special Artist and
Correspondent</hi>.)</p>

<p rend="right">W<hi rend="smallcaps">ASHINGTON</hi>, Dec. 6.</p> 
<p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">FEW</hi> hours after dispatching my last
letter I heard of an act which had I known of sooner would probably
have induced me to suppress much that I had written favourable [sic]
to the Union cause. A people's conceit had been overlooked by me in my
belief in a principle, and I had smothered much of that feeling which
most Englishmen are prone to after a probationary course of American
arrogance. Anxious to do my duty to your readers, and honestly to
publish my convictions, I have never for a moment allowed myself to be
carried away by acrimoniousness, and personally I have heard much that
is bitter for an Englishman to hear. As I have said before, I have
looked upon the Union as a principle that should and ought to be
preserved-as an edifice, great and wonderful of its kind, built at the
cost of infinite intellect, wealth, and labour [sic]. Though the
architecture that has served for model in its construction may be
contrary to our notions of perfection, yet we cannot see a noble pile
destroyed without some feeling of compunction at its ruin. In this
spirit have my former letters been written.</p>
<p>Your readers are long before this aware that an English Royal Mail
steamer has been boarded by a United States' ship of war, and from
beneath the folds of the British flag four gentlemen belonging to the
"Southern Confederacy" have been forcibly removed. As to the legality
of this act I have nothing to say; it rests with the authorities on
international law to decide the question between the two Governments,
though as a subject of Great Britain I, with the captain of the Trent,
must protest against the violation of that flag which it is an
Englishman's creed to believe inviolable. But I have much to say in
reference to the bearing of the people of the Northern States since
they have been informed of this, according to their journals, "most
heroic achievement." It will make us all blush, when we turn back to
our chronicles of the sea, to find how utterly insignificant are the
deeds of our own naval commanders when compared to the brilliant
exploit of the Captain of the San Jacinto and her crew in boarding an
unarmed passenger-ship. I am not writing idly while giving utterance
to this sentiment. I am prompted to do so by the panegyrics pronounced
by one and all here on the deed which is to form "the brightest page
in contemporaneous history;" and, being in the minority, I must needs
bow deferentially to the opinions of the mass. But if, in the
minority, I might presume to express my own notions of what has been
done, I should suggest the idea that, if Captain Wilks be an honest,
true-hearted sailor, he must repudiate thoroughly, and with feelings
of something more than disgust, the vile and maudlin adulation of
those who would seek to magnify into Nelsonian proportions an event
which he, probably, estimating at its proper value, would soon have
forgotten. I am not going to quarrel with Captain Wilks for placing
himself in the position which has elevated him, through the absurdity
of his countrymen to the somewhat ludicrous pedestal on which he finds
himself. He no doubt considered he was doing his duty; and it remains
for Crown lawyers and other learned authorities to determine whether
he has done so or not.</p>
<p>When the first intelligence reached here of the capture of Slidell
and Mason, with their secretaries, the public excitement was greater
than anything I have witnessed throughout my experience of the
campaign. The arguments at the American Bar (rooms) went fast and
furious; the <hi rend="smallcaps">pros and cons</hi> (few of the
latter) were bandied from one stump orator to another, and most of the
discussions ended in any amount of smashes (brandy-smashes, I mean),
while numerous skins (whisky skins) were roughly handled by judge and
jury. "Waal [sic] now, Mister, I guess that the overhauling of that
thaar [sic] Britisher[sic] is a big thing anyhow, and I'll be dogged
if Cap'n Wilks ain't been right smart to lay a hand on them skunks"
(meaning the Southern Commissioners). This opinion was of course
received with unanimous applause, when another gentleman moved "That
now Uncle Sam had got'em [sic] in his fist he should squeege'em [sic]
pretty tight, and not mind nary international laws." Amongst the
better classes the feeling is just as strong in favour [sic] of what
has been done, and I have heard persons of consideration say that they
would rather see Slidell and Mason hanged in the face of an English
fleet than have them given up should international treaties place
England in position to demand their surrender. But the other day I
overheard the following conversation in reference to the possible
recognition of the South, and the probable demand of England for
reparation to her flag:--"Now, just look here: can't Pennsylvania
raise 800,000 men?" "Well, she can whip France, and I reckon New York
can fix England, and tother[sic] States can easily whip the South."</p>
<p>There is hardly a corporation in New York or Boston that has not
given a public reception to Captain Wilks. City halls have been turned
into josshouses[sic], and the guest has been made the joss before whom
all have bent in wondering admiration. Historical societies have
thrown wide their portals, their members have assembled in solemn
conclave to welcome to their midst the hero of the hour, and with the
leaves of their ponderous tomes spread open, and goose-quills neatly
nibbed[sic], they have told the rough seaman that such men as he made
history, and that theirs was the task in the present instance of
inscribing one of the brightest pages in the chronicles of
centuries. Can the momentous drama now being acted in the New World be
so travestied? Can an intelligent people be duped by such mockeries
and not perceive their shallowness? The system of raising a golden
calf one day and falling prostrate in blind worship before it, then
breaking it to pieces the next because the prayers offered have not
been answered, is very much the fashion here just now. First we see
the veteran Scott removed from the high pinnacle beneath which
thousands chanted their hymns of praise. Numerous minor idols of
popular or political belief follow in his wake, while only latterly
Fremont the chosen has been summarily dismissed from his command to
make way for a successor whose career may be more short-lived
still. And, if the signs of the times may be accepted as an omen, "the
coming man, the modern Alexander, the young Napoleon," as journalists
have delighted to term M'Clellan, with oceans of other adulatory
titles-he, too, has nearly run his course. Already strong parties are
sapping at the foundations of the pedestal on which he stands, and a
bitingly-sarcastic pamphlet has appeared bitterly attacking him for
his want of energy and the sluggishness of his movements. How long,
let me ask, will Captain Wilkes maintain his position in the niche
which he at present occupies in the Walhalla of Northern heroes? Well,
in the discussions that have been created by this all-absorbing topic
of Slidell and Mason, much has been elicited that is antagonistic to
England; and I, who have been a strong partisan of the North, lament
that it should be so. The arrogance and selfishness of those whose
cause in my Lilipntian manner I had espoused has been portrayed as I
never saw it before, and I feel I have only been doing my duty in
expressing myself as strongly as I have.</p>
<p>With regard to the conduct of the war I can say but little; matters
on the Potomac remain nearly in statu[sic] quo, The vast accumulation
of troops, much better drilled and disciplined then they were, are
lying idle within their lines, though it is impossible to say whether
they will go into winter quarters where they are or advance. With the
exception of a few reconnaissances, no movement whatever has taken
place, and this torpid condition of matters is raising a great outcry
throughout the North; the capitalists who have been furnishing
Government with funds expressing loudest of all their discontent. It
appears to me that the plan of the Cabinet is to operate on the
Southern seaboard by means of naval expeditions, and I suspect they
hope to draw off from the centre the troops of the Carolinas,
Louisiana, &amp;c., for the protection of their various States. The
success of such strategy would have the effect of weakening the
Confederate forces at Centreville and Manassas, where it is reported
they have an army of over 70,000 men, strongly intrenched[sic], and
perhaps enable M'Clellan to make a dash towards Richmond. However this
may be, I am getting tired of this continual "Wait another week and
you will see something done,' which I am constantly being told by
officers high in command. At present I am almost at a standstill for
subjects for illustration, and I shall have shortly, in case of
nothing transpiring here, to look around me seriously for another
field. The only persons who appear to me to display any amount of
activity are the greedy hordes of hungry contractors, who are
determined to have their pound of flesh from the sorely-pressed
Union. They flock here in myriads, and it was only last evening that I
had pointed out to me a gentleman with a gracefully-curved proboscis
who, by a lucky stroke of "Pishness, my tears," had succeeded in
bagging a hundred thousand dollars of the public money.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> is necessary to preface the following
catalogue of the principal international questions which engaged the
attention of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States
from 1814 to 1861 by observing that the object of the editor is not
the base one of further inflaming the public mind against the United
States' Government and people, but the simple and legitimate one of
affording desirable and seasonable information to the readers of this
Journal. In order, further, to guard against the possibility of
misconstruction, we beg to draw attention to three facts-first, that
the seceded States are equally responsible with the loyal States for
the past policy of the United States, be it good or evil; secondly,
that the present Administration and Congress of the United States are
substantially revolutionised organisations which ought not in equity
to be held too strictly accountable for the misdeeds of a past with
which they do not, in many respects, desire to be identified; and,
thirdly, that the great mass of the party now in power in the United
States consists of those, or the sons of those, who in former times
have loyally striven to preserve peace between the two countries, and
without whose co-operation that peace could never have been so long
preserved unbroken. If, on the present occasion, the conduct of the
Republican Administration and Senate on this their first trial only
rises to a level with the maxims of the extinct Federalist and Whig
parties, whose political heirs they are, there is no danger of the
affair of the Trent being allowed to drift into the last extremity of
war.</p>
<p> In 1817 General Jackson, of Tennessee, warring against the
Seminole Indians in Georgia and Alabama, marched into Florida, then a
Spanish possession, without declaring war, seized two Indian traders
named Arbuthnot, a Scotchman, and Ambrister, an Englishman, whom he
accused of inciting the Indians to hostilities, and tried them by a
court-martial, which sentenced the former to imprisonment, the latter
to death. General Jackson took upon himself the responsibility of
executing both. The Marquis of Lansdown, at the opening of the Session
in 1819, brought the subject before the House of Lords, and
stigmatised the act as "one of those naked acts of violence which
disgraced those by whom it was committed." Lord Liverpool stated in
reply that the execution took place without the authority of the
American Government, and that the act was not such as necessitated a
demand for reparation, the refusal of which would necessarily bring on
a war between the two countries. The action of General Jackson in
overruling the milder sentence of the court-martial could not, he
said, be spoken of without horror. No more notice was taken of the
event in Parliament; but the Opposition party in Congress loudly
condemned the conduct of General Jackson. It is a little singular that
this outrage, which is narrated in every school history in the United
States, where the unfortunate victims figure as "English emissaries,"
is not even alluded to either in our "Annual Register," "Knight's
Pictorial History of England," or Miss Martineau's "Thirty Years'
Peace."</p>
<p>In 1818 a commercial treaty was made between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In 1828 President Monroe and Mr. Canning co-operated in securing
the independence of the revolted Spanish American colonies. It was on
this occasion that the celebrated "Monroe doctrine," directed against
European interference on the American continent was first broached.</p>
<p>In 1887 the Canadian rebellion broke out and engendered a plentiful
crop of troubles. American "sympathisers" on the northern frontier,
after robbing the United States' Arsenal at Buffalo of its store of
arms, crossed the border and joined themselves to the rebels. A party
of them took possession of Navy Island, in the Niagara River, two
miles above the Falls, and within the jurisdiction of Canada. They
were supplied by a small steamer called the Carolina. One night a
party of Canadian militia, under the command of Sir Allan M'Nab,
crossed the river, cut the Caroline from her moorings in American
waters, set her afire, and let her float down the Falls. An American
citizen, named Durfee, shared the fate of the Caroline; and public
opinion in many quarters called on President Van Buren to declare war
against Great Britain; but wiser counsels prevailed. No reparation was
ever made for this act.</p>
<p>In 1840 this affair was the parent of another singular
complication. Alexander M'Leod, a loyal Irishman, while in a tavern at
Lockport, in the State of New York, made a foolish boast to the effect
that he was one of the party engaged in cutting out the Caroline. A
mob arrested him and threw him into gaol on the charge of aiding in
the murder of Durfee. The British Minister at Washington protested
against this act of the mob, declaring the operation to have been
effected in obedience to the colonial authorities, and therefore an
international question, for which an individual engaged therein as a
soldier was not liable. The British Government assumed the
responsibility of the destruction of the Carolina, and demanded the
release of the prisoner. The local magistrates were about to release
him on bail, but a mob overawed them. A committee of the Federal House
of Representatives demanded that the man should be held. As the
Federal Government would not prosecute, the State of New York stepped
in and tried M'Leod for an offence against one of her
citizens. Fortunately there was unquestionable evidence of an alibi,
and a verdict of acquittal was procured.</p>
<p>For many years the disputed question of the North-Eastern or Maine
boundary had been a chronic source of trouble between the two
countries. Fortunately for the cause of peace, the Whig party
triumphed in the Presidential election of 1840, and the Administration
of President Harrison immediately addressed itself to the task of
settling this formidable difficulty. On the British side Lord Aberdeen
was actuated by similar feelings, and Lord Ashburton was sent over to
the United States charged with this special mission. He and
Mr. Webster, the then Secretary of State, negotiated a treaty
(ratified in 1842) which settled the boundary line as it stands at
present. There were parties on both sides who were discontented with
this negotiation. Lord Palmerston stigmatised it as "the Ashburton
Capitulation." In reply to analogous attacks in the United States
Senate, Mr. Webster produced a map with the boundary line marked in
the handwriting of George III, which proved he had made a good
bargain. His conduct in concealing this map from Lord Ashburton was
unfavourably commented on in England, though defended by the chiefs of
the Conservative party.</p>
<p>At the same time the treaty for the suppression of the African
slave trade was entered into. The "right of visit" was tacitly
allowed, and the Americans agreed to keep a squadron on the African
coast to guard against the abuse of the American flag.</p>
<p>The case of the Virginian brig Creole arose in October, 1841. While
this vessel was on its way from Norfolk to New Orleans, some slaves,
who formed part of the cargo, obtained possession of the ship, wounded
the captain and some of the crew, killed a passenger who owned some of
the slaves, aud[sic] carried the vessel into the British port of
Nassau, New Providence. Of the 123 slaves on board nineteen were
arrested, on the requisition of the American consul, on the charge of
mutiny and murder. The case against the negroes was pressed with zeal
by the Federal Government, but the law officers and law peers of Great
Britain were unanimous that there was no law by which the negroes
could be tried or detained. The nineteen prisoners were therefore set
free.</p>
<p>The Maine boundary question had hardly been settled when the Oregon
or North-Western boundary dispute acquired highly-dangerous
proportions. Even so early as 1822 Lord Castlereagh told the American
Minister in London that such was the condition of this question that
war could be kindled by holding up a finger. In 1818 an agreement had
been entered into opening the Oregon territory to the occupation of
settlers from both countries. On this footing things had remained
until 1844. The partisans of war sent out thither a numerous American
emigration, which greatly added to the difficulty of a peaceful
settlement. The American war party claimed the whole territory up to 5
4deg. 40 min.; and in the Presidential election of 1844 Mr. Polk, who
was pledged to enforce this claim by war, if necessary, was elected in
preference to Mr. Clay, the Whig candidate, who favoured a
compromise. Mr. Polk's Message in December, 1845, was substantially a
war message; but, thanks to the moderation of the Senate, where the
Whig and Southern Democratic senators acted in alliance, a compromise
was agreed to settling the line to the Pacific at 49 deg., and giving
the island of Vancouver to Great Britain. President Polk, in assenting
to this arrangement in 1846, threw the responsibility upon the
Senate.</p>
<p>In 1850 the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was made, about the true
construction of which a serious difference was to arise a few years
later.</p>
<p>In 1852 the Newfoundland fishery dispute broke out. Lord Derby's
Government sent instructions to the commanding Admiral to protect the
exclusive rights of the colonists within three marine miles of the
coasts of British North America, as provided for by the Treaty of
1818. The execution of these instructions caused great excitement in
the United States, which was increased by the inflammatory popular
speeches of Mr. Webster, then Secretary of State. American ships of
war were ordered to the spot end a collision was imminent.</p>
<p>The final settlement of this question was effected by the
Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, negotiated at Washington by Lord
Elgin. According to this arrangement the legislation affecting the
commerce between the United States and British America was altered in
a free-trade direction, the navigation of the St. Lawrence was opened
to American bottoms, and the exclusive right of shore-fishing was
abandoned.</p>
<p>In consequence of the filibustering expedition of Lopez against
Cuba, the Governments of Great Britain and France, in 1853, invited
the Government of the United States to enter into a tripartite treaty
to guarantee the possession of Cuba to the Spanish Crown. Mr. Everett,
then Secretary of State, refused to accede to the proposal.</p>
<p>In 1854 President Pierce, on some trifling pretext, ordered the
bombardment of Greytown, a city under the protection of Great
Britain. This act received the reprobation of the principal
Governments of the civilised world.</p>
<p>In 1856 the differences between Great Britain and the United States
on the Central American question came to a crisis. Under the
provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty the American Government
claimed that Great Britain was bound to surrender her possessions in
British Honduras, the Bay Islands, and the Mosquito Protectorate. Lord
Clarendon declined to accede to this interpretation, but offered to
abide by the award of a third party. To this the American Government
would not listen, and at the commencement of 1856 war seemed
imminent. Nevertheless, the American Government did not press its
requisitions to the point of war, and, after some fruitless attempts
to negotiate on a more moderate basis, this question has been settled
by the abandonment by Great Britain of the Mosquito Protectorate and
the Bay Islands, the former by treaty with the State of Nicaragua, the
latter by treaty with the State of Honduras.</p>
<p>In 1856 occurred the dismissal of the British Minister at
Washington (Mr. Crampton), on the false charge of having engaged in
the enlistment of soldiers for the British service on United States'
soil, Great Britain then being at war with Russia. On a similar charge
of breach of the neutrality laws three British Consuls had their
exequaturs withdrawn from them.</p>
<p>In the same year the resolutions of the Congress of Paris in
reference to maritime law were submitted to the United States
Government for adoption. The Administration of President Pierce
refused to assent to that article which abolished privateering, unless
a clause were added exempting private property from seizure at sea. To
this proposal the Government of Lord Palmerston refused to assent, and
it was afterwards withdrawn by Mr. Buchanan, the successor of
Mr. Pierce.</p>
<p>In the same year the United States' Government purchased of the
salvors the derelict British barque Resolute, of the Arctic
Expedition, equipped and refitted her, and sent her back to England.</p>
<p>During Mr. Buchanan's term of office, with the close of which this
resum&eacute; will terminate, but two points of difference arose. In
1858 the British Government, in the desire of stopping the slave trade
off the coast of Cuba, exercised "the right of visit" in the Gulf of
Mexico. This caused a unanimous burst of indignation from both the
great parties of the United States, and the practice was formally
abandoned by the British Government. All propositions for adopting
means by which the nationality of vessels suspected of being engaged
in the slave trade could be ascertained were rejected by the
Administration of Mr. Buchanan.</p>
<p>In the same year the Atlantic cable was laid, and messages of
mutual good will were exchanged between the Queen and the President
and the Mayors of London and New York.</p>
<p>In 1859 General Harney seized the island of St. Juan, the right to
which is claimed by both nations under the treaty relating to the
North-western boundary. This act of General Harney, being contrary to
an express understanding between the two Governments that neither
party should occupy the island until the right of possession had been
determined, led to a remonstrance by the British Governments. General
Scott was sent to the Pacific coast to overrule General Harney. The
affair terminated in the joint occupancy of the island, and in the
recall of the offending General.</p>
<p>In 1860, on the invitation of President Buchanan, the Prince of
Wales made a tour through the Northern and Western States. The
incidents of this memorable tour are still so fresh in the public mind
that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them. It will be a terrible irony
on the civilisation of the age, a standing reproach against human
nature, if this visit of reconciliation- which seemed to be a fitting
finale to a bitter and long-standing international feud- should, after
all, be nothing but a mocking prelude to a third war with the United
States- war so often imminent, yet, as we have seen, as often
avoided.</p>

<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">NEUMATIC</hi> P<hi
rend="smallcaps">ILE</hi>-B<hi
rend="smallcaps">RIDGE</hi>--Mr. C. C. Martin, the American engineer
who completed the Brooklyn Waterworks, carried on the erection of a
bridge across the Savannah River until interrupted by the civil
war. This bridge is on the line of the Charleston and Savannah
Railroad, about sixteen miles from the latter city. When completed, it
will consist of six fixed spans and a swing-bridge, with an aggregate
length of 900 feet. The two abutments and seven piers are to consist
of pneumatic piles-the abutments and four piers to be of two piles
each, the piers at the end of the swing-bridge to consist of four
cylinders each, and the pivot-pier of five. The cylinders are cast in
sections, nine feet in length and six feet outside diameter, with two
inches of metal. The apparatus for sinking these piles consists of a
large flat boat, upon which is placed a 16-horse power steam-engine,
and two double-acting air-pumps, hoisting apparatus, &c. In the <hi
rend="italic">Journal of the Franklin Institute</hi>, Philadelphia,
appears an interesting account of the process of sinking the
cylinders, with illustrative woodcuts. Two portions of cylinder are
made airtight by whitelead, and held in proper position by "guys,"
&amp;c. The pumps are set in action, and the cylinder sinks into the sand
(about six feet in three minutes) on the application of a vacuum. As
the process proceeds, a syphon pipe and other apparatus are
employed. When at last a stopcock is opened, and the compressed air is
allowed to escape suddenly, the upward pressure from within is removed
and the cylinder, by its own weight, forces itself deeply into the
sand. The amount of sand which enters the cylinder under the bottom
when the pressure is allowed to escape is astonishing. When a cylinder
sank less then a foot the sand rose inside it twenty-two feet (equal
to twenty-one cubic yards), which was brought in by the rushing water
in a few minutes. On one occasion, when the men were at work in a
cylinder, they suddenly heard a sound like the report of a cannon, and
all became as dark as night. The report was occasioned by the sudden
removal of the pressure from without, while within the air was
condensed. The darkness was occasioned by the rapid condensation of
the vapour held in invisible suspension in the condensed air, forming
a thick fog.</p>

<p>Although we believe that there was scarcely an Englishman whose
first and warmest feeling was not a determination to hold to the
honour of his country and the vindication of international rights, yet
it can hardly be supposed that any one amongst us was blind to the
sacrifices and the inevitable consequences which must follow a hostile
venture of any kind who did not recognise the truth of the saying that
peace is the happy, natural state of man, and that it were better that
she should be allowed still to go on achieving those victories which
are no less renowned than those of war. In short, the point on which
the fortunes, the events, and the happiness, more or less, of the new
year turned was our relations with the Federal States of America.</p>
<p>If to a certain extent we are still held in suspense in that
respect, there is now much, very much, to encourage the hope of a
pacific solution of a difficulty, the extent and importance of which
we in this country at least have never underrated. In the first
instance, as we all know, the matter in dispute did not strike on the
American mind with any sense of that real magnitude which has since
been somewhat more acknowledged. The palpable change in the feeling,
as we believe, which has come over the bulk of those whose influence
on the action of the Federal Government could probably not be
overrated seems to be the most natural thing in the world. The mind of
England was expressed with a unanimity, a directness, and a thorough
apprehension of the gravity of the question; the course of her
Majesty's Ministers was prompt, the deliberations of a single Cabinet
Council resulting in a special address to the Government of
Washington, the substance of which it was evident must be in
accordance with the voice of public opinion; and at once, and with an
activity which spoke well for the condition of our administrative
departments, preparations were made for any eventuality. The process
of reasoning amongst the Americans must have received its first
impulse from these facts; at least the notion that what had occurred
was a small matter involving no serious consequences must have been at
once disabused. Reaction, arising, not from anything which could be
construed into timidity, but from an appreciation of<pb n="34"/> the
importance of the issue, may reasonably be supposed to have even then
commenced in the States. But when it was ascertained that first and
foremost France, then Prussia, then Austria, and, as it is said, even
Russia, spontaneously expressed opinions that, on principles of
international law, the affair of the Trent cannot be justified, it was
hardly to be conceived that a nation which the leading Powers of the
civilised world in combination declare to be in the wrong could
persist in backing up its error even at the cost of a war, which to
call disastrous would be employing a very feeble phrase indeed. There
never was a situation in which a great people could afford to act
gracefully and to bend, with no loss of honour, before an acknowledged
law of society. It seems to us that it would have been mere frenzy in
the Americans to stick to a quarrel which, in universal international
opinion, is deficient in that element of justice which, did it exist,
would thrice arm those who espouse it. To the petulant outbreaks on
this question of the professors of "bunkum" which some of the latest
accounts tell us have not been wanting, even in the comparatively
sedate discussions of the Senate, we attached little weight, for we
believed they were no longer in accordance with the feeling of the
American people at large; and, if the matter in dispute has been
settled with less graciousness than might be desired, it will be owing
to some such ruder spirits as those who have recently made
uncompromising motions in Congress with a want of success which is in
itself not a little significant.</p>
<p>Happily we are able to say that the first great cause which must
have influenced the destinies of the twelve months into which we have
just entered has been removed; that there will be no war...</p>
<p>As we set out, so we conclude, that, when we looked forward to the
new year, much, if not all, of its happiness depended on the news we
were awaiting from our kindred in the West. Now that we know that
there is to be peace between us, we do not reflect with anything but
satisfaction on the course which this country adopted, and we think
with equal pleasure on the course which has been adopted by the
American Government.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Jura we have news
from New York to the 28th ult. The City of Washington's advices had
previously relieved us of our painful suspense as to the issue of
peace or war.</p>

<p>SURRENDER OF MESSRS MASON AND SLIDELL.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons received his despatches early on the 19th ult., and had
several unofficial interviews with Mr. Seward, at which the demands of
the British Government were made known to the American Secretary, but
not formally delivered. Mr. Seward met Lord Lyons in a friendly
manner, but entered into no conversation with him on the points
involved. It was not till the 23rd that Lord Lyons formally presented
the demands of the British Government to Mr. Seward, who received a
copy of Earl Russell's despatch.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons informed Mr. Seward that he would wait till the 30th for
a reply.</p>
<p>On the 25th M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington,
presented M. Thouvenel's letter to Mr. Seward, and on the 27th, three
days before the expiration of the term granted by Lord Lyons,
Mr. Seward conceded the demands made by Earl Russell.</p>
<p>After coming to this resolution the American Administration
immediately published the correspondence, in order, probably, to
justify its course in the eyes of Congress and public opinion. The
Jura brings the following summary thereof:-</p>
<p>The correspondence commences with a despatch from Mr. Seward to
Mr. Adams in London, dcelaring that Captain Wilks acted without
instructions, and hoping that the British Government would consider
the subject in a friendly temper. Mr. Seward says also that the
British Government may expect the best disposition on the part of the
Federal Government.</p>
<p>The next despatch is from Earl Russell to Lord Lyons, stating the
outrage on the British flag, and hoping that the act was committed
without instructions from the Federal Government, as that Government
must be aware that Great Britain cannot allow such an affront to pass
without reparation. Earl Russell expresses a hope that the Federal
Government will offer suitable redress by giving up the four prisoners
to Lord Lyons.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward replied that the English Government rightly conjectured
that the act was without the authority or knowledge of the Federal
Government. He trusts that England will see that the Federal
Government neither practised nor approved any deliberate wrong in the
transaction, and declares that Great Britain has a right to demand the
same reparation as the United States would expect from any friendly
nation in a similar case. Mr. Seward says he is aware that he argues
on the British side of the case; but in doing so he is only defending
American principles. He quotes the instructions from Mr. Madison,
Secretary of State in 1804, to Mr. Monroe, Minister to England, and
says, "If I decide this case in favour of my own Government I must
disallow its most cherished principles and for ever abandon its most
cherished policy; but the country cannot afford such a sacrifice. The
Government cannot deny the justice of England's claim." Mr. Seward, in
conclusion, states that the four prisoners are at the disposal of Lord
Lyons, and asks his Lordship to indicate a time and place for
receiving them.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons, in his reply, says he will forward Mr. Sewards
communication to the British Government, and will confer personally
with him in regard to the reception of the four gentlemen.</p>
<p>The note from M. Thouvenel to the French Minister on the Trent
affair is included in the correspondence.</p>
<p>On the 24th it was said on good authority that thus far only the
President and Secretary Seward had handled the question on the
American side, the last regular Cabinet meeting having been adjourned
by a note from Mr. Lincoln, to avoid the risk of a general and
premature discussion.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEBATE IN THE SENATE.</p>
<p>On the 26th Mr. Hale, a Republican Senator from New Hampshire,
demanded the correspondence with England on the Trent
question. Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Committee
of Foreign Affairs, objected to this demand.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale stated that he had heard the Cabinet were considering the
proposition to surrender Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said also he
would favour foreign arbitration; but, if England had demanded the
surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, the Federal Government should
declare War against England. "If they were surrendered, the Senate,"
said Mr. Hale, "would be subject to the scorn and indignation of the
country, and the Administration would be hurled from power." Mr. Hale
believed that Napoleon would desire to wipe out the stain of Waterloo,
and that thousands of Irishmen in Canada would join the Federal
cause. Mr. Hale concluded a violent speech against England by urging
war sooner then the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell.</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner urged that the consideration of the question should be
delayed until it was presented in a practical form. He denied that
there was proof of arrogant demands on the part of England, or that
the Administration had not considered the question of arbitration, and
stated his belief that the matter would be honourably and amicably
adjusted.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale's motion was tabled for future discussion.</p>
<p>On the 23rd the House of Representatives adjourn until the 2nd
instant.</p>

<p>The trade circular of Messrs. Neill Brothers forcibly describes the
transition of sentiment among this class:-</p>
<p>The first emotion when the news of that event became public in this
country was a mingled one of surprise and delight with the boldness
and the exploit and at finding such important enemies in Northern
custody, and of fear that the act was illegal and impossible to
maintain. Even the President himself admitted that the prisoners would
probably have to be given up. But forthwith the press of this country,
whose main policy is to charm their readers and increase their own
popularity by telling the public whatever they would like to hear,
devoted themselves heart and soul to the work of convincing themselves
and their readers that the act was perfectly legal, in accordance with
precedent, and especially with English decisions. It is easy to
convince those who wish to believe; and as all the argument was on one
side, with none to expose its fallacies, sophistries, and
misrepresentations, it is not surprising that the mass of the people
should have been speedily satisfied; and, being convinced as to the
legality of the act, neither was it surprising that among a people so
self-confident as to their power of judging correctly and so vain of
their military strength, a unanimous determination should be arrived
at and expressed not, under any circumstances, to part with the
prisoners. The mob desired to hold them, right or wrong; the more
respectable citizens determined to hold them because they had already
been so easily convinced it was right. . . . .Thus for a few days war
between Great Britain and the Northern States seemed almost
inevitable. But wer are happy to be able to inform you that during the
past three days there has been a most salutary and extraordinary
change in public sentiment here and<pb n="35"/> throughout the
country. It was to a great extent a game of brag, after all, and none
the less so that the people had deceived themselves quite as much, if
not more, than they deceived others..... Whereas, a week ago, nine out
of every ten men would tell you that England might threaten as she
pleased, but the prisoners would never be given up, now the balance of
opinion is quite the other way.....Upon a deliberate review of the
delicate, and apparently extremely hazardous, relations of this
country with Great Britain, we are inclined to believe war between the
two nations now more distant than we thought it before the present
complication arose. The American Government had for some time past
acted upon a presumption that England's interests in the preservation
of peace with them were so great that she would bear any number of
petty indignities rather than make them a cause of war. This idea will
now probably be modified, and there may be a little more of that
respect shown to British subjects which they are accustomed to receive
in other foreign countries, and fewer arrests of them without process
of law or opportunities fir[sic] their justification or defence.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEELING OF THE PEOPLE</p>
<p>The popular feeling in intensely hostile to England. Even those
journalists and others who urge the necessity of yielding in the
present instance do so, avowedly, from motives of expediency,
recording a vow meanwhile that henceforth England's difficulty shall
be America's opportunity. No passion less strong than that for
restoring the Union would, they say, allow them to consent to the
surrender of the captives. It is freely charged that the British
nation, in its desire for cotton and to dismember the Union, is only
seeking a pretext for a quarrel, and that they have taken advantage of
the momentary weakness of the United States to humiliate the latter to
the dust. It must be observed, however, that these lively expressions
of resentment were uttered before the despatches from the Continental
European Governments had been published.</p>

<p rend="center">A NEW DIFFICULTY.</p>
<p>The telegraph reports a new outrage on the British flag, apparently
similar to that of Commander Wilks. The Federal steamer Santiago de
Cuba overhauled, on the coastt of Texas, the schooner Eugenia Smith,
sailing under the British flag. She found nothing contraband on board,
but took from her deck two passengers, who, from the papers found upon
them, were supposed to be agents of the Confederate States. These
passengers, Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, had arrived at New York, and
been confined in Fort Lafayette. The telegram says that the schooner
was sailing between Matanzaosand Havannah, two Cuban ports; but for
Matanzas, Metamoras, a Mexican port, should probably be read.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TREATY WITH MEXICO.</p>
<p>A treaty between the United States and Mexico is reported to have
been submitted to Congress, by which the Federal Government agrees to
pay Mexico 11,000,000 dols, to refund the British and French
claims. Mexico is to grant the United States commercial privileges and
permission to transport across the Mexican territory.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>The harbour of Charleston has been destroyed, sixteen whaling hulks
filled with granite, having been sunk in three parallel lines
equidistant across the channel. The flow permitted to the water will
prevent the cutting of a new outlet, and the obstruction will soon
accumulate a triple line of sandbanks across the entrance.</p>
<p>A force of 1300 Confederates have surrendered themselves to the
Federal forces on Missouri, with their baggage and equipments.</p>
<p>There has also been a slight engagement at Drainsville, near
Leesburg, in Virginia, in which the Confederates, being overnumbered,
were forced to retire.</p>
<p>From Beaufort, South Carolina, the Federal forces have dispatched
to New York a cargo of 120,O00lb. of sea-island cotton, gathered by
the refugee negroes, and there were 400,000lb. more ready for shipment
by the next vessel.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
<p>Congress has raised the duty on tea to 20 cents per pound, on
coffee to 5 cents per pound; on sugar, 2 1-3, 3, 5, and 8 cents per
pound, according to quality, and on molasses to 6 cents per
gallon. These measures were in accordance with Mr. Chase's
recommendation. These duties came into force immediately, and apply to
all goods in warehouse.</p>
<p>Congress has appropriated 1,500,000 dollars for gun-boats on the
western lakes, and 1,200,000 dollars for the establishment of a naval
d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The New York banks have lost five million dollars in specie in a
fortnight, and the Sub-Treasury four millions; yet only about half a
million has left the country, although the rate of exchange gives a
profit on the export of specie to England. It is evident, therefore,
that hoarding has begun. Under those circumstances a suspension of
cash payments is considered to be imminent.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Abolitionist leader of Boston, had
delivered an address in favour of emancipation and against the
"reconstruction" of the Union, in the Cooper Institute, New York, to a
crowded audience, consisting of the &#x00E9;lite of the city.</p>
<p>At the annual dinner of the New England Society to commemorate the
landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, a letter from Mr. Seward was read,
dated Dec. 11, of which the following is the material portion:-</p>
<p>Dear Sir,-Pray present my apology to the sons of New England for
declining their invitation to the New England dinner. My duties here
allow me little enjoyment of the holidays. If it were an Old England
dinner instead of a New England feast I would certainly strain a point
to attend. I would like so good an opportunity to attempt to show to
our cousins across the seas that there is no material benefit or moral
influence that can accrue to us that will not also increase the
prosperity and greatness of Great Britain, and that every disaster
that befalls the United States is also pregnant with suffering and
sorrow sooner or later to be borne by Great Britain.</p>

<p>Thomas D'Arcy M'Gee, in a letter just published, declining to speak
at a festival of the New England Society, at Montreal, writes as
follows:-</p>
<p>"I declare most absolutely, and it is well that the opponents of
Canada should know in time, that the Irish inhabitants of this colony
will be found embattled as one man in defence of the Canadian
Constitution and the Imperial connection. There is hardly a group of
Irish settlers in Upper or Lower Canada that I have not personally
visited during the last four or five years. There is not a man of note
amongst them, layman or cleric, that I have not met: and I declare
that I have yet to meet the first man of all those bodies and orders
of men who does not frankly and loyally prefer our Canadian
Institutions to those of the United States. Formerly, I believe, it
was different with many among them (as I own it was some years ago
with myself); but since the era of 'the knownothing' movement the last
vestige of political preference for the United States has disappeared
among the Irish here."</p>

<p rend="center">ARRIVAL OF A FEDERAL WAR-STEAMER AT SOUTHAMPTON.-</p>
<p>A correspondent writes from Southampton on Wednesday evening as
follows:- "The Tuscarora, one of the new screw-corvettes built for the
Federal Navy, arrived in the river this afternoon, about half-past
three o'clock, from New York. She left that port on the 15th ult., and
had a very rough passage across the Atlantic, and put into Fayal for
coals, sailing thence eight days since. From Fayal she has had fine
weather. The Tuscarora is commanded by Captain T. Augustus Craven, and
her officers and crew number about 200 in all. She mounts nine heavy
guns, two of them the famous 11-inch columbiads (both on pivots), six
broadside guns, and a rifled Parrot gun on the forecastle. The
corvette is a smart-looking vessel, of 1200 tons burden, and barque
rigged. She is just built, and only arrived at New York from
Philadelphia on the 9th ult. It is understood that her mission in
these waters is specially to look after the Nashville, and generally
to protect the interests of Federal shipping. The Nashville remains in
dock, and her future movements are, of course, kept profoundly
secret. She is coaled and ready for sea; and it was rumoured this
morning that she was going out of dock during the day into the river;
but up to this time (five p.m.) she is lying quietly in her
berth. Whether she will now keep her quarters a close prisoner, keenly
watched by the Tuscarora, until the conflict is over, or whether, on
some favourable opportunity, she will venture to 'run the blockade'
and escape, time only can determine."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 11,
1862.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> dove has come and not the eagle. On
Wednesday evening a telegram from Lord Lyons was brought by the City
of Washington mail-steamer announcing that the act of Captain Wilks
was annulled by the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their
two secretaries. The relations between England and the Northern States
are, therefore, placed upon their former footing.</p>
<p>That Mr. Lincoln has performed this act of justice is
sufficient. In what way it has been done, what the document with which
Mr. Seward has accompanied the notification to Lord Lyons may be, what
the American journals may say, what indignation may be expressed by
mob meetings- are all considerations which may be set apart from the
main point. A Government has had the wisdom to do justice and to
repudiate, by deed if not by word, an outrage upon the flag of another
Government. It may be that the right thing has been done in the wrong
manner, and that there may be little cause for sentimental outbreak
upon the subject. But right has been done, and the horrors of war have
been averted; and in this there is surely enough to prompt the myriads
who will assemble to-morrow in the House of Prayer to offer grateful
thanksgivings to Him who " heareth and answereth prayer."</p>
<p>It would, at the same time, be an absurd affectation to pretend any
doubt as to the human means that have wrought this most desirable
issue. England has made at once an unmistakable manifestation of
feeling and a magnificent demonstration of power, and public opinion
and wise statesmanship have acted in unison. It was made clear to the
American Government that we should enforce our rights, and the
President has had the prudence to risk unpopularity for the hour
instead of encountering defeat and disgrace for his country. We do not
see that it is either necessary or generous to examine too closely the
reasons which he may offer to the excited people of America. If he
chooses to tell them that they are engaged in what has, up to the
present time, been an unsuccessful war, which is costing them a
million and a quarter of dollars every day, and that for the sake of
detaining four gentlemen in a State prison it was not worth while to
engage in a new contest, in which the overwhelming force of the most
powerful nation in the world, supported by the opinion of Europe,
would instantly be brought to bear upon the North, we have no right to
complain that he should take that line, instead of boldly declaring
that he unhesitatingly reversed a wrong. Mr. Seward's State paper, be
it what it may, has been framed rather for his own countrymen than for
England, and will in due course be answered, no doubt, by the terse
dialectics of the Foreign Office. Some of the journals will, of
course, be venomous, and will threaten us with signal chastisement
when the empire of the North shall be re-established and the South,
trampled, shall be unable to interfere. For this, and for the Greek
Kalends, we will wait patiently. The single point on which it is
possible that the good-hearted John Bull may feel he would like to
reply is the allegation that he made his demand "in the hour of
America's disasters and distress." This is altogether a brand-new
statement of the case. Six weeks ago we were solemnly and vauntfully
assured that America was exceedingly rich and powerful, and had nearly
three-quarters of a million of soldiers ready for anything. The South
was to be repressed the moment General M'Clellan should be ready to
move, and then the army of the North could move upon Canada, or
Ireland, or Yorkshire, if necessary. Therefore we had no right to know
anything about distress or disaster, and might consider ourselves as
doing a bold thing in asking the flushed and fiery champions of the
Union to surrender their prey. But, even supposing that the North were
unfavourably circumstanced, it could not justify her in doing a wrong
or us in submitting to one. It is not because a man is irritated and
upon bad terms with his wife and family that he is to be allowed to
rush into another man's house and carry off his property. We have,
however, made the demand for reparation in the most considerate way,
have done everything to conciliate, and, by means of a graceful and
informal piece of diplomacy, we left it open to Mr. Lincoln to seize
the opportunity of making an open to Mr. Lincoln to seize the
opportunity of making an unenforced atonement for a pirate's
action. We are therefore clear of all blame in the whole transaction,
and legally, morally, and even sentimentally, we have shown ourselves
friends to the Americans. When the storm shall have gone down this
will be admitted by all except the viler of the journals. It is said
that a man whose position may, at no distant date, be a far higher one
than is now supposed- the Commander of the American Army- has already
declared that England has acted rightly.</p>
<p>We must now wait details, but we wait in a far different attitude
from that in which we were to be found until Wednesday. We welcome the
dove, and Britannia throws down the lanyard, rejoiced that she is
spared the pain of a straggle with those for whom, despite all their
unkindness, she ever retains a warmer sympathy than she can feel for
any other nation in the world.</p>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MONG</hi> the Illustrations of the civil war
in America which, by means of our Special Artist in the Federal camp
on the Potomac, we have been enabled to give in this Journal, some
have been devoted to showing the queer punishments to which the
rowdies of the camp are subjected; and our Number for the 28th of
December last contained an Engraving of the drumming a loafing scamp
out of the Federal army. These, however, are common incidents in camp
life. The provost-marshal of the Alexandrian division has had to carry
out a severer sentence. On Dec. 13 a private in the Lincoln Cavalry,
named Johnson, was executed at Fairfax Seminary, near Washington, for
desertion. The execution took place before a large body of troops. As
the procession passed along, the doomed man was seated in a waggon,
and by his side was a Roman Catholic priest, who was giving to him the
last ministration of religion. He held open a prayer-book before the
prisoner, who, with his head bowed down, was attentively reciting a
prayer. When he had arrived at the place of execution he alighted from
the waggon and seated himself on the coffin. Twelve men, detailed to
execute the sentence, took their position about six paces in front. He
addressed a few words to them, stating that as fellow-soldiers he
hoped they would forgive him for having committed the offence he had,
and that they would not do as he had done. A few parting words were
given to his spiritual adviser and three or four officers, after which
he prepared himself to have the sentence executed. He was seated on
his coffin when the word was given to fire. Eight balls pierced
various parts of his body, but as he only showed a slight tremor the
reserve was ordered to fire, and four other shots were fired, one of
which entered his eye, and another his mouth, and he fell
dead.</p></div2>

<p>The privateer Sumter, after being, as was thought, sighted off
Ramsgate, has turned up at Cadiz, where, with the officers and
crews-forty-two persons in all-of three Federal merchant-vessels which
she had destroyed at sea, she solicited permission to enter the
port. The American Consul demanded that this request should be
refused, but, the Government having been consulted, the Sumter was

<p>To our inexpressible relief and gratification we were able to
announce in our last Number that the Government at Washington had
definitively acquiesced in the claim made upon them by the British
Government for the restoration of the persons taken from on board the
Trent by the Captain of the San Jacinto to the protection of the flag
beneath which they were illegally seized. A calm review of the facts
of the case, an attentive and dispassionate perusal of the diplomatic
correspondence, and a fresh survey of the fearful calamity from which
this decision has rescued both countries, have increased rather than
lessened our thankfulness for this peaceful issue of the difference
which three weeks ago looked so theatening. Both the countries
concerned have reason to rejoice, for, in the event of war, no matter
which of the two may have been the victor, it could have become so
only by passing over the mangled remains of its own most cherished
policy.</p> 
<p>Besides the usual and inevitable evils inseparable from a hostile
collision between two great Powers-the waste of blood and treasure,
the interruption of trade, and the demoralisation of the people on
both sides-war with the Federal State of America would have forced
upon Great Britain an immediate, and perhaps a permanent, sacrifice of
one of her foremost national purposes-namely, the extinction of the
slave trade and the discouragement of slavery all the world
over. Whatever may have been the grounds upon which the States of the
North have come into conflict with those of the South-whatever may be
the professed object for which they are carrying it on, at such
immense cost to themselves, and hitherto with so little apparent
success-at whatever time and in whatever way it may be ultimately
decided-one thing is certain, that as slavery was the remote cause of
the quarrel between North and South, so, but for foreign intervention,
slavery will be weakened, and in the end destroyed, by the prosecution
of the struggle. Quite apart from the will of either of the
belligerents, this seems to be one of the unavoidable consequences of
the present civil war-the only one, we may add, which the people of
England have contemplated with anything approaching to a feeling of
satisfaction. A war with the Federal<pb n="58"/> States would
instantly have coerced us into unwelcome but not the less mischievous
complicity with the bitterest opponents of that policy with which,
more than any other nation upon the face of the earth, we have
identified the name and fame of England, for which we have made the
largest sacrifices and braved the ill-will of other maritime Powers,
and the final success of which seemed even to the most moderate
expectation to be very close at hand. England, allied with a
confederation of slaveholding States, the corner-stone of whose
constitution is not merely the lawfulness but the expediency of
slavery, and the thinly-veiled object of whose policy is the wide
extension of slave territory and the speedy revival of the slave
trade-England, recognising such a confederation, and thereby imparting
to it a vitality and strength which it neither possesses nor deserves,
and assisting it to make good its position against the Free States of
the North, from which, for the sake of perpetuating and extending
slavery, it wantonly seceded;-such a position as this would have been
for our country a cruel necessity, entailing upon it a humiliation,
and exhibiting to the world a scandal, for which no military nor naval
success could have been accepted as adequate compensation. Thank God,
we have escaped the danger.</p> 
<p>And yet, with this miserable contingency before their eyes, we do
not see how the British Government could safely or honourably have
declined to front it, nor how they could have met the embarrassment in
which it placed them more wisely or with more dignity than they have
done. As soon as the facts relating to the capture of Messrs. Mason
and Slidell on board the Trent steamer had been laid before them, they
were calmly referred to the law officers of the Crown for judicial
investigation as to the bearing in which they stood to the law of
nations; and, on the report of those responsible officers that the
Captain of the San Jacinto had taken upon himself to execute judgment
on his individual, and of course unrecognised, authority, without
appealing to the decision of a Prize Court, and had thereby offered an
affront to our flag, Earl Russell irnmediately forwarded to Lord
Lyons, our Minister at Washington, a despatch, couched in the most
courteous terms, assuming that the act of aggression could not have
been committed with the authority or approbation of the Federal
Government, and intimating that the only reparation which this country
could accept would be a restoration of the captured gentlemen to the
protection of the British flag. Confident as her Majesty's Ministers
may have been in the expectation that Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward would
see not only the justice but the policy of admitting this claim, it
behoved them in common prudence to make instant and effectual
preparation for the disagreeable alternative. Winter was setting
in. Canada, in the event of war, would lie exposed to the first
hostile blow from the Federal States. She was wholly unprepared. The
quarrel was not hers. England was bound to place her, if possible, in
a position of security before the rigour of the climate should
preclude all access to her along her own coasts. Hence the despatch to
Washington was immediately followed by the dispatch of troops to
Quebec and Halifax. All available means were taken to strengthen the
fleet. In short, while earnestly desiring peace, and shaping their
course so as to facilitate to the utmost its preservation, the British
Government exhibited the greatest promptitude, activity, and
forethought in making ready for war. In both respects, we believe,
they secured the approbation of the country.</p> 
<p>Mr. Seward's despatch to Lord Lyons has happily averted the dreaded
rupture of amicable relations between the two peoples. He has
justified our claim-he has surrendered the prisoners. Let us accept
with generosity what has been conceded with a show of
cheerfulness. His able despatch might, under other circumstances,
provoke criticism. Its conclusion should disarm any such desire. A
mutual analysis of national motives would do neither nation the least
good, and would probably exhibit neither to unmixed advantage. On both
sides irritating questions might be asked which it would be difficult
to answer in any way that would not exasperate. We have asked the
Federal Union to do us right, and they have done it, openly admitting
that what we asked was justifiable and reasonable. Between individual
gentlemen such a course is held to bury the offence out of sight, and
the propriety of the rule is equally recognised by nations. We should
be sorry, therefore, to demean ourselves by raking among the ashes of
the past for matter of offensive comment, or food for
self-complacency. There is in any such attempt a revolting malignancy
and pettiness of spirit which true and magnanimous Englishmen will
scorn to countenance. Reparation having been made, bygones become
bygones. The wretch who shakes hands over his antagonist's apology and
concession, and thereupon begins to reopen his complaint, displays
himself as a pitiable example of impotency in the government of his
own passions. If the <hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi> fails to
satisfy him, he is justly believed to be nursing a wicked design
beneath a pretended regard for the unsullied purity of his name. Great
Britain, we are certain, will not be guilty of that unspeakable
meanness. What has been frankly yielded, even though more tardily than
she could have wished, will be as frankly received. Why it was not
offered before she will forbear to inquire; and no one better then she
knows, and none more fully than she can appreciate, the difficulty of
at once closing the ears and the heart against the whispered
insinuations of national pride. The last American war was occasioned
by our failing to determine in time what we resolved, when too late,
to surrender. We have reason to be thankful that Mr. Lincoln did not
delay his decision beyond the limit allowed him for deliberation.</p>
<p>We may extract if we will from the anxious experience through which
we have just passed two or three lessons that may be of service to the
world generally as well as to ourselves in particular. We have already
recorded our emphatic approbation of the steps taken by her Majesty's
Ministers to obtain redress for the injury inflicted upon us by
Captain Wilks. We sincerely wish that, inasmuch as it was well known
that they had sent out to the Government at Washington a courteous but
firm demand for reparation, and inasmuch as it could not be known that
such demand would be rejected, there had been less of angry excitement
during the interval. That portion of the public press which for the
last month has been labouring with great power, and, we are compelled
to confess, with too much success, to inflame the warlike passions of
the British people by parading before them as a premeditated and
defiant insult what turns out to have been the rash and foolhardy act
of a naval captain, committed on his own responsibility, has done
itself and the people of this country but little credit. Had it been
necessary to stimulate our own rulers to the performance of what was
due to the honour of this nation, some extenuation, if not excuse,
might have been pleaded for pursuing this course. But no such
necessity existed, or was believed to exist. Neither could the
extravagant and fierce denunciation of the American people and their
institutions contribute in the smallest degree to the pacific decision
of the Federal Government; for the greater part of it will have been
read across the Atlantic only after the offence has been disclaimed
and the reparation made. Unhappily, we have allowed ourselves to be
goaded into an unseemly display of passionate indignation, without any
obvious necessity and before the fitting occasion for it had arisen,
to the manifest danger of increasing the in-will of America and the
exposure of ourselves to ridicule in the eyes of foreign nations. The
inconvenience which will, no doubt, accrue to us from this want of
self-restraint may well teach us that, when a people have taken the
proper steps to vindicate their national honour, it becomes them to
await the issue with self-possession and calm forbearance.</p>
<p>The events of the past month will, we trust, impress upon the minds
of our countrymen another lesson. The occasion has been one on which
the Emperor of the French, if actuated by the secret hostility to this
country which not a few have persistently laid to his charge, might,
without going out of his way, have turned to a selfish account by
leaving it to take its course. A war between England and America would
have made him master of the situation in Europe. Once more, as in the
presence of the Indian mutiny, he has rebuked our distrust by the
loyalty of his behaviour. He chose to throw the whole weight of his
immense influence with the Cabinet at Washington into the scale of
peace by urging a frank concession of our demand. We trust the fact so
honourable to his Government will be borne in mind when next an
attempt is made to sow between him and ourselves the seeds of a
groundless suspicion.</p>
<p>Lastly, let us, in parting from this subject, express our earnest
hope, as we have taken occasion to do more than once already, that the
difficulty from which we have just escaped will lead to a liberal
revision of maritime law. It is susceptible of vast amendments in
favour of neutral commerce, and, we believe, the policy of Great
Britain has hitherto been the chief obstacle to their being
effected. If the painful excitement through which we have passed
should conduce to the framing and establishment of a clear and
reasonable maritime code, the benefit will have been cheaply purchased
by the outlay to which we have been subjected by the affair of the
Trent. In that case the event will have furnished the happiest modern
solution of Samson's riddle, "Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness."</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Edinburgh and Nova Scotian we have news from
New York to the 4th inst. The chief points of interest are the
departure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their secretaries, and the
suspension of cash payments by the United-States' Treasury and the
banks.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEPARTURE OF MESSRS. MAS0N AND SLIDELL.</p>
<p>The Boston <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi> of the 30th ult. says:-
There was no communication with Port Warren on the 28th, in
consequence of the gale, and the prisoners taken from the Trent were
ignorant of the decision of the National Government in favour of their
release. Next day newspapers were carried down, containing the
official correspondence, and Mr. Mason was noticed at the window of
his room perusing the intelligence with a smile of satisfaction upon
his countenance.</p>
<p> On the 1st inst., at eleven o'clock, the four prisoners left Fort
Warren, in Boston Harbour, very quietly, and went on board the steam
tug-boat Starlight, and were conveyed to Provincetown, on the northern
extremity of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where they were received by the
British steam gun-boat Rinaldo, which was to convey them to Halifax,
Nova Scotia, whence they would be conveyed to England by the Cunard
steamer.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EUGENIA SMITH CASE.</p>
<p>Orders have been given by the Government for the release of
Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, taken from the British schooner Eugenia
Smith by the United States' steamer Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p>THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE CABINET.</p>
<p>A usually well-informed correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New
York Tribune</hi> gives the following account of what passed within
the White House in reference to the Trent affair:-</p>
<p>At the first Cabinet meeting held after the seizure of
Messrs. Slidell and Mason, the President expressed himself in favour
of restoring them to the protection of the British flag if it should
be demanded. He said it was doubful if the course of Captain Wilks
could be justified by international law; and that, at all events, he
could not afford to have two wars on his hands at the same
time. Attorney-General Bates echoed this opinion. He thought the
seizure unjustifiable, and was in favour of giving up the men upon
demand. Secretary Seward was non-committal. The other members of the
Cabinet disagreed with Mr. Lincoln positively; and Secretary Chase
argued forcibly and with warmth that the course recommended by the
President would be dishonourable to the United States as a
nation. Thus matters stood until the first belligerent note from
England. No further discussions took place, nor was the question again
mooted in the Cabinet until Christmas Day. The despatch from Earl
Russell to Lord Lyons was delivered at the State department on
Saturday, as we telegraphed the next day, and Mr. Seward immediately
went to work on his reply. Remembering the views of the Cabinet
previously expressed, Mr. Lincoln was not in haste to call them
together. One meeting was adjourned to prevent premature discussion,
and another on the regular day did not take place. The first was on
Christmas Day, and after Lord Lyons had made his
communication. Immediately M. Thouvenel's despatch had been delivered,
Mr. Seward's reply was read to the Council, in a session prolonged for
five hours. The despatch of M. Thouvenel had convinced the opponents
of the policy of surrender that the public opinion of Europe would
sustain England, and it was used to secure unanimity in that
policy. Mr. Seward's despatch, however, was subjected to much
criticism. Many alterations and modifications were suggested. The next
day a revised copy was read to the adjourned Cabinet meeting; further
changes were suggested; and the despatch, as a whole, was not approved
and adopted until Friday morning.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TONE OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>The tone of the American press, taken as a whole, is much less
hostile to England since the settlement of the Trent difficulty than
it had been for many months previous. The Philadelphia papers are more
bitter than those of New York and Boston. There is, however, an uneasy
impression abroad that the British Government is only seeking an
opportunity for breaking the blockade of the Southern ports for the
sake of dismembering the Union and procuring a supply of cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SUSPENSION OF CASH PAYMENTS.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the 28th ult., the New York bankers held a
meeting and agreed to suspend cash payments from the 30th ult. This
example was followed by the banks throughout the country. The specie
in the vaults of the New York banks had fallen from 50,000 000 to
24,000,000 dols. Exchange on England had risen to 113, gold was
already at a premium of l&#x00BD; to 2 per cent. The banks had
informed the Government that they could give it no more aid. They
refused to take the fourth loan of 50,000,000 dols, asked by the
Federal Government. The scheme of Mr. Chase for superseding the
ordinary bank currency by an issue of Government notes had been
dropped. The commercial classes were pressing on Congress the
necessity of providing a revenue to the amount of at least 150,000,000
dols. The popular subscriptions to the national loan are now merely
nominal in New York, not amounting to 100,000 dols. a week.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>The Senate has agreed to Mr. Sumner's resolution, asking the
President to transmit to the Senate all the correspondence which has
taken place since the Paris Congress in relation to neutral and
belligerent rights upon the ocean.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevens had introduced into the House of Representatives a bill
for abolishing Southern ports of entry.</p>
<p>The Navy Department had sent out specifications inviting proposals
from shipbuilders throughout the country for the construction of
ironclad steam-batteries. The commission appointed to examine the
Stevens floating-battery had reported against it.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had been confined to his bed for ten days by a
depressing attack of low typhoid fever. At last accounts his health
had somewhat improved.</p>
<p>The Comte de Paris and the Duc de Chartres, acting, it is said, on
the advice of their mother, had resigned their commissions in the
Federal service.</p>
<p>New-Year's Day was marked by especial cordiality on the part of the
diplomatic corps. All the Foreign Ministers, with their Legations,
were present at the official reception at the White House, and all
subsequently called on the Secretary of State. The presence of the
entire British and French Legations at both places was especially
noticed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>There have been destructive fires both in Nashville, Charleston,
and Richmond. In the former city the commissary stores, including a
portion of the Ordnance Department, and valued at one million dollars,
were destroyed. In Richmond the theatre had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The Confederates in Kentucky had destroyed a large portion of the
railway between Louisville and Nashville.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> states that a large
Federal force from Beaufort had landed at North Edisto, on the South
Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The return of the chief emigration agent of the Canadian Government
for the year 1861 shows that the troubles in the neighbouring country
have partially turned the tide of European emigration towards
Canada. The gross total of persons landed in 1861 was 19,923, against
only 10,150 in 1860. This gives an increase of nearly 100 per cent;
and the agent "has every reason to believe" that the year just entered
upon will show, if Canada is spared the calamity of war, as large an
increase of immigration in 1862 over that of 1861 as that of 1861 was
in excess of the previous year. The nationalities of the immigrants
were:-Norwegians, 8814; English, 3579; Irish, 3160; Scotch, 2011;
Germans, 2182; Russian Poles, 27; French, 10; United States' Citizens,
12; Canadians and others, 371. The destination of about half was the
United States.</p></div2>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> Tuesday's <hi
rend="smallcaps">Gazette</hi> are published some documents making an
important addition to the large mass of official correspondence which
has already been published with reference to the Mason-Slidell
case. These documents more immediately concern the course of our own
Foreign Office in the matter.</p>
<p>On the 19th of December Earl Russell wrote to Lord Lyons, giving
the details of an interview which took place on that day between his
Lordship and Mr. Adams, the American Minister. On that occasion
Mr. Adams communicated to our Foreign Secretary the substance of
Mr. Seward's despatch, declaring that Captain Wilks, in seizing the
two Southern Commissioners and their secretaries, had acted without
the authority of the Washington Government, which stood "quite
uncommitted" on the question at issue. The noble Earl's comment upon
this explanation was, that he "thought it would stand in place of an
apology." On the point which still remained to he settled, Lord Lyons
was instructed as follows- "If he (Mr. Seward) asks what will be the
consequence of his refusing compliance, I think you should say that
you wish to leave him and the President quite free to take their own
course, and that you desire to abstain from anything like menace."
Mr. Adams asked Lord Russell point-blank, "whether, if Lord Lyons came
away a declaration of war would be the immediate consequence?" -a
question to which the noble Earl replied that "nothing was decided on
that point; we should wait for a reply from America, and then decide
upon our course."</p>
<p>In a despatch dated Jan. 11, Lord Russell has the satisfaction of
announcing to our Minister at Washington-who is thanked for the
"discretion and good temper" he has manifested in this important
matter-that the liberation of the prisoners and the explanations
offered by Mr. Seward "constituted the reparation which her Majesty
and the British nation had a right to expect." His Excellency was,
however, informed that her Majesty's Government could not assent to
the conclusions arrived at by the Federal Secretary of State on some
points of international law, and that the discussion of these
questions, would form the subject of a special despatch. "In the
meantime," adds Lord Russell, "it will be desirable that the
commanders of the United States' crusers should be instructed not to
repeat acts for which the British Government will have to ask for
redress and which the United States' Government cannot undertake to
justify."</p></div2>

SURPRISED<lb/> BY CONFEDERATE CAVALRY.</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">UR</hi> Special Artist in the Federal camp,
visiting the advanced posts on the 12th ult., came upon General
Blenker's pickets at Auandale, about ten miles from Washington. Whilst
he was in the neighbourhood a dash was made at them by a squadron of
Confederate cavalry- fine, rough-looking fellows, dressed in
nondescript uniforms, red shirts, grey tunics; some with boots and
some without; armed with sabres and revolvers. Many of them were very
powerfully built, and as they rushed in among the men of the 45th New
York they clutched at them and dragged thirteen off at a gallop. Three
or four were killed on each side. An Engraving of this dashing attack,
from a sketch by our Special Artist, is given at page 61.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HIS</hi> magnificent work was erected for the
purpose of connecting the New York Central and the Great Western of
Canada Railways, and the cost was contributed by both companies in
equal portions. It is by means of this bridge only that an unbroken
journey can be made from New York, or Boston, to the western part of
Canada, without changing carriages; the consequence of which is, that
the best and cheapest route to the west, not only of Canada, but also
of the United States, is still by the New York Central and the Great
Western of Canada Railways, although many other western routes have
sprung into existence since this was completed. Chicago and the
western prairie country generally are reached by this route more
easily than by any other, as is also Detroit and all parts of
Michigan.</p> 
<p>The great bridge the subject of our present notice was not the
first of the kind which spanned the gorge of the Niagara River, an
ingenious suspension-bridge having been constructed across it many
years ago by Mr. C. Ellett, but of very fragile and temporary
character when compared with the present work.</p>
<p>The Niagara Railway Suspension-bridge was erected from the designs,
and under the personal superintendence, of Mr. John A. Roebling, at a
cost of 400,000 dols. The first engine crossed over it on the 8th of
March, 1855. It carries a double line of rails on the upper part, and
an ample roadway for carriages below.</p>
<p>The plan adopted in the construction of this suspension-bridge
differs materially from those usually built in England. Instead of
flat wrought-iron plate-links, connected together by pins passing
through their extremities, Mr. Roebling uses a simple wire-cable, or
rather four wire cables, each lOin. in diameter, and composed of 3640
separate wires, the whole of the cables being capable of bearing a
weight of 12,000 tons; the actual load they carry never exceeds 1000
tons. The wire ropes are securely anchored in the solid rook,
30ft. below the surface; they pass over the summits of four solid
stone towers, 8Oft. in height. Beside the wire cables there are 624
suspending-rods, whose ultimate strength is equal to 18,720 tons;
these support the roadway at different parts, and are connected with
the cables above. There are also sixty-four over-floor stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1920 tons, and fifty-six river-stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1680 tons; these latter stays extend from the
bridge to the rocks on either side of the ravine. The total length of
span between the towers is 8OOft., and the "railway track," as it is
always called in America, is 250ft, above the surface of the water in
the river.</p>
<p>The great object sought to be obtained in this remarkable bridge
after strength to carry its load, was rigidity; for in all
suspension-bridges, as ordinarily constructed, the deflection and
oscillation would be such as to entirely prevent their being used for
the purposes of carrying railway traffic. The Niagara Suspension
Railway-bridge, although not perfectly rigid, is sufficiently so to
allow of heavily-laden trains passing over it at a maximum speed of
five miles per hour; even then a very considerable deflection takes
place, but not such as to in any way betray weakness; on the contrary,
it is rather an indication<pb n="68"/> of strength, as showing the
correct action of all its parts, by which means a true bearing is
obtained over every part of it.</p>
<p>A wonderful amount of ingenuity and mechanical skill is displayed
in the construction of the roadway, which forms a species of lattice
or tubular girder, the railway track being on the top outside, and the
carriage roadway on the bottom inside. The frequent admixture of wood
and iron, and the numberless small bolts and screws passing through
the former material, will require constant care and supervision to
prevent decay occurring, and may probably cause the cost of
maintenance of the bridge to be excessive. Portions are now being
constantly renewed, and always with an increased strengthening of the
parts. The bridge, however, taken as a whole, must be looked upon as a
decided success and a triumph of American engineering skill; while the
advantages of a perfect communication between the United States and
the most valuable portions of the British possessions in North America
cannot be overrated. The general effect of the Niagara
Suspension-bridge is that of extreme lightness and beauty; the
situation in which it is placed is exceedingly fine, being in view of
the Great Falls, while below it the Niagara River rushes through its
confined channel, a foaming, noisy rapid 15Oft. deep, almost as
terrible in its roar and force as the mighty cataract itself.</p>
<p>A bridge similar to the Niagara Suspension-bridge, and of even
greater span, but only carrying an ordinary roadway, ha[sic] been
built over the River St. John, in the city of St. John, in New
Brunswick. This bridge, some time after it was erected, gave way
during a terrific gale of wind. The suspension cables remained sound
and fully equal to their duty; but the roadway had been insecurely
connected with the abutments, and it broke adrift at that point. The
whole length of roadway oscillated many feet clear of the abutment
altogether, yet only a portion of it gave way, the bridge proving
itself in all other respects equal to withstanding strains that it
never was expected to be subjected to.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna we have news from New York to the
evening of the 11th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">WAR NEWS.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had not yet fully recovered from his attack of
typhoid fever, but had taken several airings in a carriage.</p>
<p>General Bnrnside's expedition had left Annapolis and would
rendezvous at Hampton Roads. The precise destination of this
expedition has been kept a profound secret. The Boston <hi
rend="italic">Traveller</hi> announces that several divisions of the
army of the Potomac will reinforce this expedition.</p>
<p>A fight is reported to have taken place at Huntersville, in Western
Virginia, in which the Confederates retired with loss in killed,
wounded, clothing, and stores.</p>
<p>A portion of the Mississippi expedition had already started on its
mission, which is supposed to be an attack on Nashville.</p>
<p>The steamer Vanderbilt had arrived in New York from Port Royal with
about 700 full bales of Sea Island cotton.</p><pb n="81"/>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S COURTESY.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has tendered to Lord Lyons permission to the British
troops en route to Canada to land at Portland, and proceed by railroad
through Maine to their destination.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The Richmond papers declare that their army is suffering severely
from the cold and that it is to a great extent demoralised. They think
that Great Britain will not be satisfied with Mr. Seward's despatch
upon the Trent question, and will make further demands. The Richmond
<hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> thinks that the sinking the stone fleet
will do no harm to the city of Charleston, but will render it
impregnable to a sea attack. Since the sinking of that fleet the
steamer Ella Warley, from Nassau, ran into Charleston with a cargo of
arms, medicines, and other stores. Several vessels have left the
harbour and run to sea by other channels, one of which has recently
arrived in Liverpool. The Captain saw nothing of the blockading
fleet.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>
<p>In a debate in the House of Representatives on the Trent question
Mr. Vallandigham expressed himself dissatisfied with the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said that America would be at war with
England in less than three months unless the Federal Government tamely
submit to the recognition of the South and the raising of the
blockade. Mr. Hutchins, of Ohio, considered that Mr. Vallandigham
wanted war with England for the benefit of the South. Mr. Thomas, of
Massachusetts, was of opinion that England had done that which had
implanted in the American breast a sense of wrong which would wait the
opportunity to strike a blow of retributive justice.</p>
<p>Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate's Committee of Foreign
Affairs, has spoken in the Senate, and taken positions similar to
those of M. Thouvenel and in advance of those taken by Mr. Seward. He
said:-</p>
<p>If Captain Wilks suspected the Trent he should have taken her into
port for decision. No Federal court, however, recognising American
precedents, could have lawfully condemned the Trent or detained the
Commissioner. The American Government has committed itself fully and
unreservedly to the right of a neutral flag to cover civil
passengers. The question has been argued with the greatest ability and
thoroughness by the most eminent American statesmen, including
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and other Presidents, and the whole record
of American diplomacy is luminous with arguments against such acts as
that of Captain Wilks. Captain Wilks, misled by a British law book,
violated American principles. England, by demanding the Commissioners,
stultified her history and virtually acknowledged the justice of a
position long maintained by America. The American people (concluded
Mr. Sumner) are indebted to Captain Wilke's act and Mr. Seward's
statesmanship for a great political triumph.</p>
<p>The Naval Committee has reported on a bill for the construction of
twenty iron-plated steam gun-boats.</p>
<p>The Committee of Ways and Means have reported a bill authorising
the issue of 100,000,000 dols. worth of demand notes, which will
constitute a legal tender, be receivable for Government dues, and
exchangeable at any time for Six per Cent Bonds, redeemable in twenty
years.</p>

<p rend="center">TRADE AND FINANCE.</p>
<p>Exchange on London has risen to 114; gold to 4 per cent premium,
and silver to 1&#x00BD; per cent premium. The imports of foreign dry
goods into the port of New York for the year 1861 amount to 43,600,000
dols., against 101,800,000 in 1860, being a fall in one year of 63 per
cent. In the year after the celebrated financial crisis (1858) the
imports amounted to 61,000,000 dols. The arrivals in New York of
passengers from foreign ports were 80,790 in 1861, against 266,627 in
1860; of passengers from California, 9117 against 10,710 in 1860.</p>

<p rend="center">ADDRESS OF CONDOLENCE WITH THE QUEEN.</p>
<p>At a crowded meeting of British residents held at the English
Cosulate in New York an address of sympathy and condolence with the
Queen was adopted.</p>

<p rend="center">NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP IN MISSOURI.</p>
<p>The Provost Marshal of St. Louis has notified to all newspapers
appearing outside that city that a copy of each issue must be sent him
for inspection, under penalty of suppression.</p>

<p rend="center">THE GOVERNORS' MESSAGES.</p>
<p>The opening of the year is the season when most of the State
Governors present their annual messages to their respective
Legislatures. The Governor of the Border State of Maine complains of
the deep and bitter hostility of large numbers of the people of New
Brunswick and Canada. He thinks that Portland should be made the
Quebec and Halifax of the United States, and that with only present
means of defence Portland would in the event of a war with Great
Britain soon be in possession of the enemy. It is requisite for these
purposes not only to construct military works on the coast, but
military railroads for their connexion with one another. If the United
States do not at once set about these works, Maine must do so on her
own account. He complains that the attitude of England has been marked
by many exhibitions of the most positive unkindness and ill-will,
while her friendship for the rebels has been manifested by an unbroken
succession of favours, valuable in themselves, but more valuable for
the hopes encouraged by the ostentatious manner in which they were
conferred. "We have all thought till recently that war with England
was scarcely within the category of possible events. That she should
make a war which she must know this country would feel and history
would record was waged by her in the history of barbarism and wrong,
and designed to inflict an irreparable and unprovoked injury upon a
nation which had been, in honest faith, her best friend and, as far as
the wishes of its people were concerned, her truest ally, was what the
American people could not believe."</p>
<p>The Governor of Michigan, another Border State, speaks "of the
manifest disposition of foreign Powers to intermeddle with our
domestic affairs," and recommends the Federal Government to establish
at some convenient point in the north-west an arsenal and manufactory
of arms, and also a naval station, to be located in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Mayor of New York, in his Message, urges that rafts or other
barriers should be anchored at the Narrows, in readiness to obstruct
the channel, if necessary.</p>

<p rend="center">DESPATCHES FROM LORD LYONS TO EARL RUSSELL.</p>
<p>In Friday's <hi rend="smallcaps">Gazette</hi> were published copies
of some despatches from Lord Lyons. The first informs Earl Russell
that Messrs. Zacharie and Rogers, taken from on board the Eugenia
Smith, under the British flag, and confined in Fort Lafayette, had
been released, and the act disavowed; a second refers to a case in
which a captured British schooner, the James Campbell, was taken into
port with the British flag flying under the American-a proceeding
which has been rebuked by Mr. Seward, and ordered not to be repeated;
and the third relates that certain English seamen, captured for a
break of blockade, having been required to take an oath never to be
engaged in such a proceeding again, have been declared by Mr. Seward
absolved from such oath.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend= "small caps">HIS</hi> vessel, whose presence in Southampton Water has caused the greatest excitement for the last fortnight, still keeps her position off

the mouth of the Itchen, supposed to be waiting the arrival of the

Sumter and holding a sharp look out on the movements of the Nashville,
still safely berthed in Southampton Docks. On Monday week the
Tuscarora weighed, and proceeded down the water, anchoring for the day
between Calshot Castle and the Lightship, returning to her old
moorings in the evening. On the following Thursday she made an
excursion round the Isle of Wight, and completed her cruise by
bringing up off Osborne, which quarters she quickly received notice to
leave, and she then returned to her old position as shown  in our Engraving. She is a smart, handsomelooking craft, ieavily armed, with eight Dalhgren guns -two of them, placed amidships, are the famous

columbiad 120-pounders-and a rifled 30- pounder of Parrot's on her forecastle. She is commanded by Captain Craven, and has a large and well-appointed crew of 200 men.</p>

<p>Messrs. Slidell and Mason and their secretaries have stilea from Halifax for Bermuda.</p>

<p>The United States' Government is erecting batteries on Croil's

island in the Long Sault of the St. Lawrence. These batteries will command

the Canadian Cornwall Canal.</p>

<p>The Confederate steamer Sumter was ordered on Saturday last

to emit Cadiz 'within six hours. She accordingly proceeded to Gibraltar.

Before entering that port she captured two American vessels, one of which she burned, releasing the other, apparently because she was bound to a British port, and was laden wit a cargo belonging to neutrals.</p>

<p>The West Indian, a vessel belonging to a Southern planter, has
arrived at Liverpool direct from Charleston, having successfully run
the blockade. She is 241 tons burden, and has s full cargo of spirits
of turpentine. She loft Charleston in the evening of the 24th of
December. It was a fine starlight night,with a favourable wind ; the
blockade was run without meeting with any of the blockading fleet. The West Indian left Charleston

after the stone fleet had been sunk, and ran down to the sea through one of

 channels left open by the Federals.</p> </div2>

<p>Once more we hear from America that a grand movement by the North
is in hand. Land and water armaments are to penetrate into the heart
of the South, Nashville is to in taken, and then a great blow is to be
struck at New Orlea'is. We can only say, as heretofore, that we shall
see. The Mississippi will now be the centre of interest for the
spectators of the strife. The sinews of war are to be provided by a
fax of 150 millions of dollars, at least such is the resolution of the
Congressional Committee of Ways and Means. There had been some violent
anti-English language in both Houses, but it seems to have expressed
the feelings of a miserable minority, the people generally being bent
upon the prosecution of the war with the South. It was said that the
Vindictive effort to destroy Charleston harbour was not likely to be
very mischievous, some reports declaring that the sinking of the
vessels would actually facilitate the improvement of the port, while
Southern organs thank the North for having made the city
impregnable. The American question has not received much public
discussion here during the week, save that Mr. Massey, the Chairman of
Committees and in some sort a Government authority, has delivered a
speech in 'which he manifested a desire that the blockade should be
broken. The journals of the Southern States believe that, bond
Pabnerston's Government are friendly to the North, and that the people
of England are inclined towards the South; and therefore the slave
journalists venture to predict a speedy fall for our present
Administration. We cite this in evidence of the titter ignorance of
the Americans of English affairs.</p></div2>

<p>As regards foreign affairs there is not much to record, except that
the Spanish expedition to Mexico is left to do the principal part of
the work of amelioration; and the commander seems inclined to perform
his duties in an effective way, and one which would probably invite
unfriendly interference by the United States if they were united and
had not their hands full. But circumstances forbid the enforcement of
the insolent and nonsensical doctrine that the Powers of the East have
no right to interfere in the affairs of the Western World, a bit of
geographical pedantry which will certainly not be tolerated in
Europe. The interests of the New World are too important to -the Old

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> Hon. Wm. Lowndes Yancey is a native
of the State of South Carolina, where he was born in 1815. Form!all
years plist, he has resided in the great Cottoate of
Alabama. Mr. ranrey is a cotton-planter, end until the date of
secession of Alabama was a member of the Bar of that State.</p>

<p>Though exercising a strong influence upon the politics of the South
during the last twenty years Mr. Yancey has but rarely been a
candidate for political honours. He has, however, served as a member
of the House of Representatives and of the Senate of Alabama, and has
also been a member of the Federal Congress at Washington. While in
Congress he took a prominent part in the annexation of Texas and in
the settlement of the difficulties between England and the United
States with reference to the disputed territory of Oregon. He was the
first in Congress to denounce the party in that body who desired to
repeal the convention for the joint occupancy of Oregon, entered into
in 1818, contending that such a repeal under the circumstances would
lead to a war with Great Britain, which he strongly disapproved of.He
also voted for the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to the
Pacific Ocean, his object being to withdraw, the slavery question from
Congress, if possible, and thus to lessen the causes of irritation
between the North and South. The Northern vote, however, defeated the
measure.</p>


<p>Mr. Yancey's chief claim to public notice rests in hisearly
recognition of the ineradicable differences existing between the North
end South, and which time, instead of diminishing, ex- tended and
strengthened. In his opinion these differences were fast
sectionalising the people of the North and the South, and he
predictedthat the Union would be dissolved whenever they stood arrayed
as sections, the one against the other.</p>


<p>In a public letter, written several years since,which excited great
attention at the time he gave it as his opinion that the South would
no longer submit to further compromise of what she considered to be
her constitutional rights, that neither parties nor compromises could
save the Union, that its dissolution was but question of time, and
that it would first takae place in the Cotton States, and thence would
spread into the Border States-a prediction that has been signally
verified within the last few months.</p>


<p>The events in progress in the Northern States,showing that the
North would present a candidate for the Presidency upon an avowed
sectional basis in 1860, induced Mr. Yancey in 1859 to urge upon the
Legislature of Alabama the passing of an Act making it the duty of the
Governor to call a convention of the people of that State to consider
so serious an event. 'When, in 1860 Mr. Lincoln was elected as an
exponent of  Northern, and an enemy of Southern, interests, the
convention of Alabama was immediately called, followed by those of all
the other Cotton States, the whole of 'which deliberately withdrew
from the Union, and, on the 11th of March, 1861, formed the Government
of the Confederate States of America. Mr. Yancey was at this time a
leading member of the convention of Alabama, and reported the
ordinance of secession.</p>


<p>In selecting three gentlemen to form a commission to the Powers of
Europe to present the claims of the Confederate States to recognition
and friendly commercial relations, President Davis considered it an
occasion to recognise the long persistent services of Mr. Yancey in
the cause of the South; and, as he had been the first to urge and
obtain the consent of the South to secede and form an independent
Ccnfederacy, it was felt that he should be the first in a commission
to obtain recognition of the new Power from the elder nations of the
earth, and especially from Great Britain and France. Hence Mr. Yancey
was appointed to be the senior or chief of the commission to Europe,
and has been in this country
 and in France in that capacity since May last.</p>

<p> In November last Alabama elected Mr.Yancey to represent her in the Senate of the Confederate States, which will be organised on the 17th of February next, the day when the
permanent supersedes the present provisional government of the South.</p>

 <p rend="center">A NIGHT ALARM IN THE FEDERAL CAMP.</p>

 <p>F<hi rend="smallcaps">REQUENTLY</hi> there are alarms in the
 Federal camp on the Potomac at night caused by the driving in of the
 pickets and the appearance in force of the Confederates at different
 points of the Union lines. On these occasions it is necessary to
 communicate with the Commander-in-Chief, and to do this expeditiously
 a new system of signals has been introduced into the Federal army. By
 day messages are sent from one division to another by the use of
 differently coloured flags, thus doing away with the
 necessityof:dispatching mounted troopers iwth written orders; and by
 night lamp-torches take their
place with the same effect. These signals can be used with an army in
motion, the corps attached to the different brigades occupying as they
 move all elevations or lofty buildings on their route. The
 accompanying Illustration represents the signals at work by night. At
 the signalman's feet lies a large brass lamp, which is the axis
 around which the motive light forms its curves-each curve, according
 to the direction which it takes, signifying a number, the meaning of
 which number being known only to the officer commanding each
 corps.</p>

<p rend="center">ADVANCE OF THE SKIRMISHERS OF THE <lb/> BUCKTAIL RIFLES ON DRAINSVILLE.</p>

<p>The heroes of the fight at Drainsvllle,Virginia, on the 20th ult.,
were the Bucktail Riflemen, a corps of sharpshooters raised in the
mountains of Pennsylvania. To be eligible for service in this corps
each man must have shot a buck, and hence the badge the members
 wear on their cape, and the name they bear. The forces engaged in
 this fight-almost the only which the Federals have gained in the
 field in that neighbourhood--were the brigades of General Stuart on
 the Confederate side, and of
 General Ord, Unionist, to the latter of which
the Buoktails belong. The incident illustrated on the first page is
where the riflemen are advancing their skirmishers through the
undergrowth towards the Confederate gum, while other Federal regiments
are making a flanking movement by a detour on each side to clear
 the pine woods. The Bucktails were consequently exposed to the
 severest fire during the action, and sufered the most. But the number
 of dead left by the Confederates in the field in front of their 
position-nearly all of whom were shot through the head-show that they
also paid dearly for the
 losses suffered by the rifles.</p>

<p>Is it our unhappy destiny to become involved in a third war with
the people of the United States, with whom we have so many ties of
language, race, religion, and laws? This is an apprehension which
weighs heavily on the public mind at the present moment, and which
Mr. Seward's highflying diplomacy, concurring with the incensed temper
towards England of the Northern people, will not allow us to
slide. "The relations between the two countries," said Mr. Gladstone,
at Leith, "afford a thousand points of contact every day, and must
necessarily likewise afford opportunities for collision." He would be
a bold man who would be willing to give assurance that those
opportunities will always be met in a spirit of mutual forbearance and
concession. The British Americans, whose situation compels them to a
close acquaintance with the character and tendencies of their
neighbours, forewarn us with ominous unanimity that the evil day is
only postponed, not conjured away for ever. How the events of the last
twelvemonth have necessarily resulted in bringing an American war,
which seemed so distant in 1860, into the foreground of our national
prospects merits a brief explanation.</p>

<p>The eleven "Confederate" States, in seceding, shattered with the
same blow the Union and Constitution of 1787 and the basis on which
peace between Britain and the Union had hitherto rested. Without
forgetting the influence in behalf of international amity wielded by a
small section of New England politicians, of whom the late Daniel
Webster and Charles Sumner are the best-known representatives, we
must, nevertheless, mainly attribute the maintenance of peace for the
last thirty years to the unwillingness of Southern politicians to
initiate a war which, if successful, could only result in
strengthening the Northern States by adding to them a territory which
would immediately give at least four anti-slavery States to the Union
and overbalance Slave-soil acquisitions at the South by immense
Free-soil acquisitions at the North. It is patent to every one that
those who struggled so fiercely and fraudulently to wrest the single
State of Kansas from a Northern immigration would be in no hurry
(however great their dislike  of British influence) to make sacrifices
to annex British America to the Union. They therefore judged it
politic to bridle the bellicose propensities of the people of the
Middle and Western States and to put them off with a succession of
vexatious international disputes never meant to be urged to the issue
of war. From this situation resulted peace, but a peace little to be
envied, because it was a pace without amity, and sometimes even
without common courtesy. On several occasions of late years it cannot
be denied that the English nation have felt that this was a situation
which benefited their political and commercial interests at the
expense of their honour.</p>


<p> This guarantee of peace is now withdrawn, and we look around in
vain to find a substitute. The South can never again be to us what
she has been. If in the present conflict she is able to maintain her
independence, then the Northern people stand alone, absolute masters
of their own destiny. If, on the other hand, the South is subjugated
by the North, she will use whatever political influence she may
hereafter possess in the Union to precipitate a foreign war, in order
that she may find therein a splendid opportunity for revolt, and a
sweet occasion for revenge. It is bootless to inquire whether the
independence or the reconquest of the South would be the most
unfavourable combination for the continuance of pace with the British
empire. It is sufficient that neither one coutingeficy nor the other
offers any stable basis on which we could reasonably rest our hopes. A
new experiment would commence-that of administering British rule on
the American continent alongside of a multitudinous, pugnacious,
-anti-British, and henceforth<hi rend="italic">unchecked</hi> democracy, dwelling south of
the St. Lawrence and the lakes. Who says that this experiment will he
allowed to evolve itself without interruption ? Not the British
Americans, nor those best acquainted with the ideas and passions of
the Americans of the North. This everpresent apprehension of war, and
all the expense of preparation that it involves, is what we must
henceforward resign ourselves to pay as the price of our continued
dominion on the American continent; and it is highly flattering to our
national self-love that no voice has been heard in any part of British
America praying us to remove our flag, although the knowledge that the
proximity of that flag is a chronic source of irritation to the
neighbouring democracy is possessed by every
schoolboy in Canada.</p>
 
<p>But if a third war with the United States be an only too probable
occurrence, then it may be said, the sooner it comes the better. "Let
us accept the first gage of battle thrown down by the Transatlantic
Demos and punish them for their rash arrogance by ensuring the
dismemberment of the Union." This is the hasty logic of the
soldier. The statesman and the moralist will argue quite
differently. Conceding that in a merely military point of view the
conditions may never be so favourable to our side as during the
existence of the present troubles in a political, commercial, and moral
point of view. If we should be tempted to pick up the glove thrown
down by a passionate people in their hour of difficulty and distress
the British nation would never be forgiven by any class or section of
the Northern people. If through any direct agency of this nation their
idolised Union were dismembered, what would be the result? Keenly
watching every turn of the world's kaleidoscope, the Northerners would
subordinate their whole foreign policy to the fantaical prosecution of
one idea-that of dismembering the British empire[sic]and
humiliating the British nation. Mr. Seward has already given us a
friendly hint of the prospects of our trade with the United States in
such an event. Conscious of the resentful character of his own people,
he shudders as he contemplates a contingency "which will leave<hi rend="italic"> no
roots remaining</hi> out of which trade between the United States and Great
Britain, as it has hitehrto flourished,<hi rend="italic"> can ever again spring up</hi>." If
our manufactures would be excluded how could our English and Scottish
immigrants hope to fare? From the Atlantic to the Pacific the United
States would be too hotly vindictive towards our race and name to
offer an asylum to our emigrtion. This is consideration of no small
moment to our middle and working classes, from whose ranks the whole
of our emigration proceeds.</p>

<p>We could expect no compensation for this terrible hostility i the
ardent attachment of the Confederate States, whose independence we
should have established. There is a moral gulf between the British and
Slave State people which no accidental, ephemeral, political and
military alliance could bridge over. The Southern Confederacy, if it
can make good its independence by its own unaided resources will
probably offer to our commerce better terms than it ever enjoyed under
the old Union; while the creation of a balance of power on the
American continent would be viewed without regret as well by Great
Britain as by the other nations of the Old and New Worlds. But these
advantages must be won for us, if at all, by Southern patriotism, and
not by English interference.</p>

<p>If these premises be correct, they lead up to this conclusion, that it
is our truest policy to exercise great forbearance towards the United
States during the course of the present war and to avoid doing anything
which seems to evince a desire to take advantage of their temporary
difficulties. It is not conceivable that any cause of difference can
arise betwee the two nations during this crisis which the
embarrassed nation would not be willing to refer to the arbitration of
a third party. It woul  be our duty and interest to give as wide an
extension to the principle of arbitration as possible; but, in the
event of cases arising which in the opinion of our statesmen could not
with propriety be referred to an umpire, then we could well afford to
be magnanimous, and wait to vindicate our honour until the United
States had their hands disengaged. Europe could not misinterpret our
motives, and the American Democracy are no longer under the delusion
that Britain "cannot be kicked into a war" with their irresistible
selves. But, indeed, the very readiness on our part to take such a
generous position would not fail to touch the heart of the American
people, and dispose them to make reparation for whatever injury or
insult they might have inflicted on us. It would also do much towards
creating such a feeling between the two nations as would postpone for
a long time, if it did not for ever avert, the outbreak of another
war. As the older, sager, and, as we claim, more chivalrous nation,
Britain, we believe, would find it conduce not less to her honour than
to her interests to take such an attitude.</p>


<p> If, however, this is to expect too much of human nature as dis
played in the relations between two rival nations, let us at least
rise superior to every temptation to take the United States at a
disadvantage, remembering that there are cases where it is not <hi
rend="italic">V&#x0153; victis</hi>but <hi rend="italic"> V&#x0153;
victoribus</hi>, and where military triumphs are fruitful only in
political, moral, and economical losses to the nation which wins them,
If after the present war is settled, by the recunquest or the
independence of the States which acknowledge Mr. Davis as their chief
the Northern Democracy force an unjust quarrel upon us, we shall see,
as we saw in 1812, a powerful peace party arise among the Americans
themselves whose condemnation of the war will enfeeble its intensity,
curtail its resources, shorten its duration, and neutralise the
resentments it would engender. But such a party will only arise in the
event of our meeting the North in fair single combat. If in such a war
Great Britain were victorious, in the reaction of defeat universal
suffrage would be offered up as a victim to the wounded national pride
of the American people, and with a limited suffrage on the south of
the St. Lawrence we should have reached once more a solid guarantee of
peace. If Great Britain were defeated and obliged to abandon some of
her possessions on the continent, the victors, in the acquisition of
one or more disaffected and anti-American provinces, would soon
discover that they had damaged themselves more than their opponent. If
(what is highly probable) a treaty of peace left neither party
victorious, the bellicose democracy would have lesrat once more that a
war on the Canadian frontier "does not pay," and would be little
inclined to re-enact for a fourth time a stale and worn-out
tragedy. Such an international single combat, deplorable as it would
be, might find us better friends at its termination than at its
commencement; and in no case, on whichever aide victory inclined,
could it leave behind it that "study of revenge-immortal hate," which
would surely be the most fell accompaniment and the most pernicious
legacy of a struggle into which we should allow ourselves to enter as
the virtual ally of those whom the whole people of the loyal States
rightly or wrongly regard as rebels, parricides, and traitors of the
deepest dye.</p></div2>

<p  rend="center">PROTEST OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>THE following correspondence has passed between the Liverpool Shipowners' Association and the Foreign Office:</p>

<p  rend= "right">Shipowners' Association, Liverpool, Jan. 13.</p>

<p>My Lord,-It has come to the knowledge of the Liverpool Shipowners'

Association, through the public prints, that the Federal Government of
the United States have sunk a atone squadron in the mom channel of
Charleston harbour. This proceeding cannot fail seriously and
permanently to injure the entrance to that harbour. The association
fears that, unless strong representations and romonstrances are
promptly made, a similar course may be immediately followed in the
case of the other harbours of the Confederate States. The association
does not think it necessary to dwell at length on the importance of
this question as affecting the general interests of commerce, but
feels called upon, as representing an important interest, to address
your Lordship on the subject. I am, therefore, instructed by the
association respectfully to press this matter on your Lordship's
earnest consideration. I have the honour to be, my Lord, your
Lordship's most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p  rend="right"> F<hi rend="smallcaps">RANCIS
A. CLINT</hi>, Chairman.</p>

<p>To the Right lion. Earl Russell, Foreign Office, London.</p>


<p  rend="right">Foreign Office, Jan. 10.</p>

<p>Sir,--I am directed by Earl Russell to acknowledge the receipt of
the letter which, on behalf of the Liverpool Shipowners' Association,
you addressed to him on the 13th inst., calling his attention to the
course which the Federal Government of the United States have adopted
for closing the main channel of Charleston harbour by sinking there
vessels laden with stone, and expressing the fear of the association
that, unless strong representations and remonstrances, are promptly
mode, a similar course may be immediately followed in the ooze of the
other harbours of the Confederate States. I am to request that you
will state to the Liverpool Shipowners' Association that the attention
of her Majesty's Government was at once attracted by the rumours which
obtained currency some weeks ago of each a course as that in which you
refer being contemplated by the Government of the United States, and
on the 20th of December her Majesty's Minister at Washington was
informed of the view taken of it by her Majesty's Government. Lord
Lyons was told that such a cruel plan would seem to imply despair of
the restoration of the Union, the professed object of the war; for it
never could be the wish of the United States' Government to destroy
cities from which their own country was to derive a portion of its
riches and prosperity. Such a plan could only be adopted as a measure
of revenge end of irremediable injury against an enemy. Lord Lyons was
further told that oven as a scheme of embittered and sanguinary war
such a measure would not be justifiable. It would be a plot against
the commerce of all maritime nations and against the free intercourse
of the Southern States of America with the civilised world. Lord Lyons
was desired to speak in this sense to Mr. Seward, who, it was hoped,
would disavow the illegal project. Now, however, that the project
seems to have been carried into effect at Charleston, Lord Lyons will
be instructed to make a further representation to Mr. Seward, with a
view to prevent similar sobs of destruction in other ports. -I am,
Sir, your most obedient servant,</p>


<p>F. A. Clint, Esq.,&#x0026;c.</p>
 <p rend="right">E.<hi rend="smallcaps"> HAMMOND.</hi></p>

<p>The subject was discussed at the meeting of the council of the
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on Monday, when the following
resolution was adopted -" That this chamber views with great
satisfaction the remoustrances made by her Majesty's Government with
regard to the blocking up of Charleston harbour by sinking vessels
laden with stone."</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Asia we have news to the 15th ult. The principal points are the removal of Mr. Cameron, the Secretary for War,

and the struggle between the Secretary of the Treasury, Congress and,

the New York bankers in reference to the ways and means.</p>

<p rend="center">THE REMOVAL OF MR. CAMERON.</p>

<p>This act for which the President is solely responsible, is
attributed, like the removal of General Fremont, to two very different
causes-first, nepotism and favouritism in the distribution of army
contracts;, and, secondly, a radical variance with the President on
the slavery question-Mr. Cameron taking the Emancipationist side. That
the latter is the more powerful motive seems to be indicated by
the. President's choice of a successor to the vacant post-namely,
Edwin Stanton, a Pennsylvanian Democrat and strong
anti-Abolitionist. Mr. Stanton was a member of Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet
after the Secessionists had left it; and the appointment is looked
upon as evincing a desire, on the part of Mr. Lincoln to conciliate
the support of the Democrats, at the rising influence of the
Abolitionists in Congress and the' country, The appointment gives
satisfaction to the army; but the, Senate has not yet confirmed it,
nor that of Mr. Cameron to the post of United States' Minister at
St. Petersburg in lieu of Mr. Cassius Clay,. who petitions to be
recalled.</p>
<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>

<p>The important negotiation between the bankers of the three great cities and Mr. Chase has not yet been, concluded. The scheme oftaxation and loans submitted by the former is unsatisfactory to the
politicians because it is too favourable to the banks.</p>



 <p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The Senate passed the bill compensating the owners of the British

ship Perthshire for her wrongful detention. The bill met with some

opposition from Senator Hale avowedly based on his anti-English

feeling. The opposition in the Lower House to the bill appropriating.

35,000 dollars for enabling the American Commissioners to make proper
arrangements for the transmission and reception of goods at the
world's fair of 1862 was more successful. The occasion was seized by
Mr. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois, to deliver a philippic against the British Government  and people.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EUROPEAN EXPEDITION TO MEXICO.</p>
<p> A note addressed by My. Seward to -the British, French, and Spanish

Ministers at Washington has been published. The President authorises. Mx. Seward to express his satisfaction at the recognition by the three,

Powers of the high interest the United States have in the destiny at

Mexico implied in the invitation extended to him to become a party to the joint expedition. The Pleaident,however, refuses the invitation on the ground, firstly, of the President's desire to maintain the traditional

policy of the United States, which forbids them to make any alliance with foreign Powers; secondly, because Mexico, being a Republican

State, deserves great indulgence from the United States. Inasmuch as Mexico is now shaken by home dimensions, and menaced by a foreign

war, the President is not disposed to seek satisfaction from Mexico at

the present moment.</p>


<p rend="center">MILITARY AND NAVAL.</p>

<p>General Burnside's expedition has sailed from Hampton Roads. No further advance has been made by the Mississippi expedition. General M'Clellan's health is not yet fully re-established. The Duo de Chartres and the Comte de Paris have returned from their furlough and resumed their staff duties in the Federal army.

 Work in the New York navy-yards had become slack, the " mortar fleet"
being nearly fitted out. The expedition for which these vessel. were
intended was expected to be the last of those about to be undertaken
on the Atlantic seaboard, as the Government agents had ceased to
charter or purchase steamers and sailing-vessels, ferry-boats, canal-
boats, and whatever other variety of naval craft they could obtain.

From Havannah we learn that up to the 8th ult. forty-seven vessels

had run the blockade of the Southern coasts, and arrived in Cuba-viz.,
thirty-seven at Havannah, six at Matanzas, and four at Cardenas.</p>
<p rend="center"> THE GOVERNOR OF NEW-YORK ON BRITISH RELATIONS.</p>

<p>Governor Morgan, in his annual message, gives expression to the

enlightened mercantile sentiment on this subject. He says:--

A recent occurrence, which created great solicitude both here and in Europe renders it not improper for me to say that no State in the Union has so large an interest as New York' in preserving amicable relations, especially with commercial Powers.

After speaking of the tonnage and value of vessels owned in th port

of New York, which amounted to 1,464,011 tons, and 96,000,000 dols.

respectively, and to the imports from and exports to foreign countries,

which in 1860 were 384,000,000 dols, in value, in addition to which

the coasting trade, amounting to double, if not quadruple, these figures, he continues

Hostilities with either of the great Powers of Europe, and, most of
all, with that

Government which, from consanguinity, language, and, customs is most;

intimately related to us, would be of untold disaster. No more pretext, no

caprice of Court or Cabinet, no cause whatever, unless it involved national


dignity or we are denied a positive right, could justify the
representatives of this State in consenting to a war with foreign
Powers, especially at a period when extraordinary supplies of men and
money have been and will continue to be drawn from us to overwhelm the insurgents at home. . . We should

not weaken ourselves by taking upon us a war of questionable necessity, Let us give no intended offence, and tamely submit to none.</p>

<p rend="center"> CALIFORNIA.</p>

<P>This State has been visited by the severest floods which have ever

occurred since its settlement by the Americans. They were caused by

heavy rains which melted the snow in the mountains, by which the,

various streams were rapidly swollen, and rose to a great height. Immense damage has been done to the cities. of Sacramento and Marysville, and also to the agricultural settlements in the neighbourhood. At Long Bar, near Marysville, about fifty Chinamen were, drowned and at Sand Flat an entire Chinese settlement was swept

away, tl!Ie poor fellows climbing into the sycamore-trees only to torn
away by the rising current. At another bar nearly one hundred

Chinamen were drowned in a narrow gorge, leaving only one to tell

the tale. All the bridges on the rivers of Upper California have been destroyed by the same terrible agency.</P>
<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The high tariff in the United States is beginning to have a favour

able effect on Canadian trade. In Montreal large quantitees of cotton,

goods have been purchased on American account. Most of these will<pb
n="105"></pb>
be smuggled. Cotton goods are now fully thirty per cent dearer on

the American than on the Canadian side of the frontier line. A large
trade is also springing up in teas, sugars, and other articles which
used to be cheaper in the United States than in Canada, but which are
now greatly dearer, on account of the increased duties; and the
smuggling is all reversed. This partially compensates Canada for the
low price of agricultural produce and the stoppage of the sawn lumber
trade, consequent on the cutting off the Southern market.</p></div2>

Mr. Seward from which his Lordship specially dissents are two-namely,
that ambassadors or agents or their despatches, are to be regarded as
contraband of war; and next, that either persons or goods, of whatever
kind, proceeding in a neutral ship from one neutral point to another
are in any case liable to capture. These principles, he says, are
repudiated by all writers on international law, whether English,
Amercan, or Continental. In conclusion he notices the "singular
passage in Mr Seward's despatch in which that gentleman says that he
would have detained the prisoners if the safety of the Union required
it. "His frankness," says his Lordship, "'compels me to be equally
open, and to inform him that Great Britain could not have submitted to the perpetration of that wrong. -From a despatch from Lord Lyons to Earl Russell we learn that Mr. Seward declares that the blocking up of Charleston harbour is only temporary; that the Federal Government will themselves remove the obstructions "as soon as the Union is restored"; and that the best proof of its being incomplete and partial is "that in spite of the sunken vessels and of the blockading squadron a British steamer laden with contraband of war had just succeeded in getting in."</p></div2>

<dateline rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 1, 1862.</dateline>

<p>M<hi rend="smallcaps">R. MASON</hi>, the author of the Fugitive
Slave Law, and his 

co-Commissioner, Mr. Slidell, have arrived in England; and the Trent drama, which at one time threatened to rise into the dignity of tragedy, is now over. The actors who performed the part of prisoners must resume their positions in private life

and assuredly we have no wreaths to throw them, nor inclination to summon them before the curtain for what paragraph-makers call an ovation. Lord Russell has published the despatch in which he demolished the barley-sugar edifice raised by Mr. Seward. The tone of the reply is, of course, perfectly courteous;

but the arguments are mercilessly hard. The garbled quotations by
Mr. Seward from Emmerich Vattel, the Neufchatel authority on International Law and the Nature of Love are restored to the context and to significance; and Lord Russell reasserts the rule

that civilians do not by their presence in a neutral vessel alter its
neutrality, be they who they may, nor do they expose themselves to
capture. To the curious observation of Mr. Seward that if it had been
for the interest of his country to detain the captives they would have
been detained the Earl simply replies such an idea is indefensible,
and that England would not have permitted such a course. The honour
and the justice of this nation being now vindicated, we presume the
matter may drop, unless Mr. Seward has leisure to compile another
miscellaneous column of fragmentary law. This, however, the clever
American lawyer may not have inclination to do, inasmuch as the sudden
and important rupture in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet may give its remaining
members enough of real business to attend to. Mr. Cameron, the War
Secretary, whose views on the subject of slavery are more in
accordance with those of England than of the North, has been suddenly
dismissed by the President, and his place supplied by Mr. Stanton who
holds by the Domestic Institution. The measure has excited a great
sensation among the powerful Abolitionist,<pb n="109"></pb>
party, and an attempt is being made to alter public opinion as

to the character of the act by blackening the reputation of
Mr.Cameron-a course not new in America, but as to the justice of which
there is at present no evidence before an English journalist. The war
offers no new feature, but it is said that the Confederates have
inflicted a severe blow upon the Federals in an action near Port
Royal, and that the details have been suppressed; but the statement
rests only upon the authority of private letters. Congress, it is more
pleasant to write, has assented to a grant for the purpose of sending
,American contributions to our International Exhibition, andwas "not
much moved" by a furious anathema pronounced against us by a gentleman
appropriately named Lovejoy, who declared that he hated England, and
would swear all his little Lovejoys to a similar feeling. Evidently
here are some matrimonial alliances in prospective for the descendants
of O'Brien De Brassicis.</p>

<p>The French troops for the Mexican expedition are now embarking, and
the rumours that it is intended to consolidate Mexico into a kingdom
under "an enlightened despotism," representative institutions having
utterly failed to keep adventurers and savages in decent order, are
becoming more and more rife, and go to the extent of even designating
the Archduke Maximilian of Austria as the King of Mexico, England, it
is said, waiving all objections in consideration of the gain to
humanity which the civilisation of Mexico win afford. It maybe that
the idea will be received with something less than favour in the
Federal States, but the South lies between Washington and the
Mexicans, and would have no objection to see the precedent of the
establishment of a new dominion-perhaps none to such dominion being a
monarchy.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend="italic">HE</hi> gentleman to whom we are indebted for the Illustration on the next page writes as follows from Gibraltar, on the 18th ult.. respecting the subject of his sketch:-" At 7.30 a.m., Jan. 18, the Confederate war-steamer Sumter, Captain Semmes, was seen from the signal-station to capture a large barque flying the Union colours, Having taken

possession of her, she proceeded in chase of another, which in half an hour she also captured. These events occurred about two leagues from the shore. She then gradually drifted further into the Mediterranean; and at 2 p.m. one of the prizes burst into flames, and is now (4p.m.) one sheet of fire from stem to stern. The Sumter is now steering towards Gibraltar."</p>

<p>A letter from Gibraltar, dated Jan. 20, published in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>  gives

the following interesting account of the Sumter's doings in the Mediterranean, and of the condition of the ship and crew:-</p>

<p>You will have already heard by telegraph of the arrival of the Sumter in

this bay. On Friday night (the 17th) a message was received here saying that she had left Cadiz, but that, her course was not known. As the wind was favourable for the passage of vessels through the Straits to the westward, it was thought not unlikely that she would steam for Gibraltar, with the object of intercepting the many Federal merchantmen homeward bound.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning signal was made from the look-out on the summit of the rock that the Sumter was six miles to the eastward, capturing two large Federal ships. The news, as may be imagined, caused the greatest excitement, and everybody rushed out to catch a glimpse of the privateer and her prey.</p>

<p> The seizure was accomplished easily enough: no defence could be made. A boat's crew was sent on board, the Federal flag hauled down, and the thing was done. The cruiser was evidently used to her work. No time was lost in searching the prizes, the few valuable effects were removed, the match was lighted, and in another moment the blazing ship was fast drifting away with the current. When evening closed the flames were still visible, darting upwards in fitful dashes on the eastern horizon. The first ship taken was loaded with sulphur, consigned, an the master endeavoured to make out, to Baring brothers; but, as Captain Semmes afterwards remarked, sulphur being the principal ingredient of gunpowder, and its exportation from England being just at this time prohibited, it was considered as well to destroy it, especially as the master had no papers to show. The other vessel taken, a large barque proved to be laden with English cargo; so she was released, and came in here yesterday.

In the evening of Saturday the Sumter anchored in this bay. On Sunday I

went on board, most anxious to see the celebrated craft that has led
the Federal Navy so dance over so many miles of ocean. When going
alongside I could scarcely believe that so poor a vessel could have
escaped so many dangers. She is a screw-steamer, with three masts, a
funnel strangely out of proportion to her sine, and a tall, black
hull, so high out of water that she gives you the idea of being
insufficiently ballasted. Four 32 pounders peeped from her sides, and
a large 8-inch pivot-gun was on her main-deck forward. Before she was
fitted for her present work she was a passenger-ship running between
New Orleans and the Havannah. Her unsightly appearance arises from the
alterations that have been made in her decks. In order to afford more
accommodation, and to give more cover for the engines and guns, a
light, temporary flushdeck has been built over what was originally the
only deck of the ship. This raises her an additional ten feet out of
water, and at the same time dwarfs her masts and funnel. She is crank
and leaky. Her engines are partially above the lower-deck, and, with
the object of preserving them from the effects of gunshot, they are
surrounded by a cylindrical casing of 6-inch wood covered with
half-inch bars--a very poor protection against an 8-inch shot. Her
officers and crew number ninety in all. The latter are a hardy set of
fellows, ready for any work--mrn who would stick at nothing. They are
of all nations --even the Irish brogue was among them. The commander,
Captain Semmes, is a reserved, determined-looking man, whose left hand
knows  not what his right doeth. He received me most courteously, and took me over his ship. </p>

<p>It is stated that the Sumter has been seen in Genoese waters, a few
leagues off the port.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">On board the Picket, Chesapeake Bay, Jan. 10.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">he</hi> Slidell and Mason affair having been satisfactorily disposed of, and the army of the Potomac still being confined to its lines, I have determined to accompany General Bnrnside's expedition to some unknown point down in Dixie, and here I am with five others in a cabin six feet nothing listening to the leadsman as he chants in monotonous tones "By the deep seven," feeling inch by inch for the channel through a fog that confines the prospect to a fathom or so of steaming water round the vessel. But before I proceed any further with a description of my voyage I will recur to one or two items connected with my sojourn in Washington, which may be disposed of briefly.</p>

<p>Of course the absorbing topic till within the last twelve days was
the probable ground the American Government would take in reference to
the demand of England for the surrender of Slidell and Mason. When I
last wrote matters bore an exceedingly bellicose appearance, and I for
one looked upon a war between the two countries as not improbable; in
fact so much was I impressed with its possibility that I intimated to
a highly respectable "coloured pussun" who takes in washing_that I
should require my linen home immediately, ready to pack up. However,
"L'hnmme propose et Dieu dispose" and this time though Jonathan
proposed doing a great deal that, was shocking and terrible to English
ears, he has finished by doing the right thing at last; and so I
suppose we may bury the hatchet and smoke the calumet of peace.</p>

<figure entity="v40p119">
<head>NEW-YEAR'S RECEPTION AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON.--FROM
ASKETCH BY OUR SEPCIAL ARTIST--SEE NEXT PAGE.</head>
</figure>
</p>

<p>Well, as diplomatic relations had not been broken off, between

the Court of St. James's and the White House, I assisted to swell

 the crowd of anything but swells who went to pay their respects to
 the President on New-Year's Day. The diplomatic corps were first in
 making the morning call de rigueur; then followed the officers of the
 army and navy; and the mobility, with whom I was, came last, getting
 but a feeble shake from the exhausted Presidential hand and arm. The
 Sketch that I have forwarded (engraved on page 119) will give your
 readers a notion of the disposition of the scene. The President
 stands close by One of the entrances to the reception-room, having
 next to him the Officer of Public Works, who is placed between
 himself and Mrs. Lincoln; the Secretaries are slightly in the
 rear. The visitors pass -directly in front of the Chief of the State,
 and each appears to consider it imperative on him to endeavour o
 squeeze the nails out of the president's fingers, who, by-the-by,
 appears to have a pleasant word for everybody, and especially
 addresses himself to the ladies and children. The whole affair lasts
 about six hours, and during this time every one remains on foot,
 making more tedious and tiring a ceremony that at any time, or under
 any circumstances, must he a disagreeable one. I presume that what I
 saw on be occasion was all right- but it appeared to me that scarcely
 sufficient respect was shown to the head of the Government by many of
 those who attended the lev&#x00E9;e. This idea especially suggested
 itself by the appearance of a considerable portion of the company,
 not so much on account of their fashion of dress as the neglect of
 their persons,Surely tidiness and cleanliness are not opposed to
 republican institutions; and it would have added to the President's
 satisfaction had some of the "bunches of fives" been less incrusted
 with the "free soil of America." The lion of the reception was Judge
 Harney, from the territory of New Mexico, who appeared in a full
 hunting costume of deerskin, attracting everybody's attention by his picturesque ensemble. Indeed, he tells me that no other garments are to be obtained on the ains, and that he adjudicates thus robed, with a rifle on his knee.</p>

 <p>New Year's Day is celebrated with great enthusiasm by the Americans
 generally. The custom which requires the ladies of a family to keep
 open house for all gentlemen who choose to call grew up in New York,
 which city is said to have imported it from Amsterdam, the mother
 city. From New York, as a centre, it was widely diffused over the
 United States and from private circles it soon spread, in a modified
 form, into public life. In the United States the theory that men in
 official position are the servants of the people is rigidly acted
 upon. Hence it because the fashion for the Mayor of a city to receive
 his "friends" on this day-the said friends including every male
 inhabitant of

the city. In like manner the Governor of the State was held to

the obligation to "receive" at the State capital. Proceeding one degree higher, the President of the nation falls in with the same ceremony. The President's reception, as before stated, is divided into in parts-first, a special reception of the diplomatic corps in the forenoon, and at noon a general reception of the public of both sexes, to enjoy the honour of a shake of the hands with, or a bow from, the chief "public functionary" of the Union, and the highest embodiment of the Sovereignty of the people. But to go back to the starting point.</p>

<p>For some time, as you are aware, there has happened scarcely
anything of importance on the Potomac, and my residence in the
neighbourhood of head-quarters staff has been productive of subjects
of but little interest, with the exception of the fights at Ball's
Bluff, Drainsville, and some odd picket engagements. Now the Burnside
expedition appears to me the only bellicose entertainment at present
on the rds, and its proportions are, infinitely greater-at least, as
far as I can glean at present-than the one which went to Port Royal. I
have reason to suppose its destination is to some important point on
the Southern coast. However, I will not attempt to prognosticate, as
anything at present is kept a profound secret from all but the General
command and the chief naval officer. Rely on it, you will hear from  me by the first chance I have of sending to you if the Confederates do not succeed in sinking the ship on which I am on board. Atpresent I must close; the fog is clearing up, we are entering Hampton ads, and this short note has to go on board the return steamer,

which is leaving immediately for Baltimore.</p>

<p>Mr. Yancey, now in London, as Commissioner from the Confederate
States writes to<hi rend="italic"> Daily News</hi>, contradicting a
statement that he is an advocate of the slave trade. He says:- "I have
never advocated the African slave trade. I do not know two public men
in the South of any note who have done so. The people there are and
have been almost unanimously opposed to it. The State laws, so long in
force, prove this, and another striking fact. There have not been 100
slaves imported into the South from any quarter for the last
fifty-three years. I know of but one small cargo, and I never heard of
another. The slave trade is carried on between Africa and Cuba alone; Southern men

have nothing to do with it. Yankee captains, Yankee ships, Yankee ship-chandlers, and Yankee capital are the notorious mainsprings of that trade.

When in the late Federal Union, in order to gain new senators to
resist Yankee taxation, the South won very desirous of forming new
Slave Slates out of the territories. But, being now out of that Union,
there is no such motive, and there are slaves amply abundant,with
their increase, for all our wants. No State, no prominent man in the
South, wishes to revive the slave trade. No sooner had the Cotton
States seceded than the Provisional Government established by them
adopted the Federal laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This
Constituion has been submitted for ratification or rejection to the
several States composing the Confederacy, and all thirteen in
number-have ratified it. Not a voice has been raised throughout the
entire South against the prohibitory clause . . . . The adherents of
Mr. Lincoln con'end that the North was determined to prohibit slavery
in the territories and the South seceded on that account. That was the
Immediate cause-it was the spark communicated to the barrel of powder;
but it was the powder that did the work and was the real cause of the
disruption. Without, however, going Into a discussion as to the real,
and, far deeper, the ulterior causes, let me show that the North, in
its avowed position cared nothing for the slave, and only used the
slavery question to obtain a political advantage. Its policy did not
propose to free a single slave, but to keep them as slaves for ever within particular territorial limits. Its policy was that none of the slaves of the Union should be removed to certain lands of the Union. The reason for that was, that for every new State carved out of those territories two senators were added to the Senate. If

 the territories could be kept for Yankee emigrants the new States
 would send two Northern senators to aid in the system of legislative
 robbery of the products of slave labour--not in aid of legislative
 abolition of slavery. For this very reason the South, in
 self-defense, finding the North for the first time united on that
 section as a policy, determined no longer to hear the ills of such a
 Govern ment It will be perceived that the North was not moved by a
 moral but by a  political policy, as devoid of honesty as of
 constitutional principle." In conclusion Mr. Yancey says:- "My
 mission here is not to ask for an approval of, nor yet to apologise
 for, the laws of the Confederate States and the opinions of their
 people. It is simply to obtain a recognition of those States as a
 Government whose people are producers of cotton, tobacco, corn and
 naval stores, and who desire to offer to manufacturing Europe the
 benefits of free trade in the peaceful interchange of those valuable
 products for the woollen, cotton, silk, and hardware fabrics of the

 Old World, unrestricted and untaxed by prohibitory tariffs. In view
 of that great object, any discussion of the internal or domestic laws
 of the Confederate Statesis irrelevant. Our system of labour is our
 own,injuring no other country, and for which no others are
 responsible to God or to man, and about which we will treat with no
 country."</p></div2>

<p>Colonel Samuel Colt, the inventor of the famous Colt's

revolver, died at Hartford, Connecticut, on the 10th ult., in his forty-eighth

year. It is stated that the wooden model of his pistol was made on

board a vessel while the inventor was on a voyage to Calcntta, in
1829. He received his first patent in 1835, and established a factory
in Paterson, N.J., but met with indifferent success. Colonel Colt
afterwards invented a submarine torpedo which was intended for the
destruction of vessels. He gave two exblbitions of the power of his
new invention in the bay off Castle Garden, by blowing up firsts a
schooner and afterwards a large brig. He then established a line of
telegraph between New York and Sandy Hook and Montauk, which was
intended to announce the arrival of vessels, and to facilitate the
dispatch of important foreign news but this enterprise failed, and
Mr. Colt became reduced in circumstances. A year or two later he again got possession of his patent for the revolving pistol, and with the assistance of a few capitalists who joined him a company was formed and a manufactory established at Hartford, which has proved very successful, not only in the making of pistols but in the manufacture of a revolving rifle,

which was also the invention of Mr. Colt. </p></div2>

<p>But, whatever else may betide it is quite certain that grave

questions of international law will arise for discussion. The delicacy
of our relations with the contending States of America will render
necessary the exercise of all the tact and judgment which the
Government have at their command during the ensuing sitting of the
Legislature. There is, we believe, little or no concealment of the
fact that a section of the House of Commons, composed of men of all
parties, will bring the subject of the blockade of the Southern ports,
and even the recognition of the Southern Republic, formally before
Parliament. It is hardly less surely ascertained that our Ministry has
had to resist no ordinary pressure which has been put upon them in
reference to these subjects from a quarter which is not generally
famous for taking a denial; and it is no small, tribute to the skill
and temper with which the department of Foreign Affairs is at present
conducted in this country that for the present, at least, the strictly
neutral policy in American affairs which England has adopted has been
triumphant. When, however, a movement which will not bear on the face
of it the stamp of mere party motives becomes prominent in the
Parliament of Great Britain, it would be too much to expect of human
and political nature to suppose that the pressure from abroad will not
be renewed with additional vigour of argument, caught from that which will be assumed to be a phase of public opinion in this country. In such a case, only too probable, it will need the binding up of every faculty of endurance and determination on the part of the Government to resist the force, the constraining power, and the influences brought to bear upon their policy towards America.</p>

<p>Above all things, there should be no dalliance with this question, no hesitancy on their part in their declarations as to the course which they intend to pursue. Already the trade and commerce of England has suffered enough by the disturbed condition of the American States; and in this, the beginning of the year, it would be a crime towards those interests if the attitude of the Government was such as to leave a doubt as to what line they propose to take in this important matter. At present our rulers profess and observe that strict neutrality which in embodied in a phrase of Earl Russell when he said that it was the duty of England to allow every nation to settle

its own internal affairs.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL VICTORY IN KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Zollicoffer, who occupied a strong position
on the north bank of the Cumberland River, in South-eastern Kentucky
finding that General Thomas, at the head of a Federal division of
15,000 men, was menacing his rear, determined to attempt to drive back
General Schoepf, whose force of 8000 men was intrenched at Somerset, a
little town six miles north of the Cumberland River. On the 18th the
attack took place, and the battle lasted nearly all day. General
Zollicoffer was killed, and his army retreated precipitately to the
intrenchments on Cumberland River. On the following day General Thomas came up and followed the Confederates to their intrench-ments. On Monday, the 20th, he was preparing to storm them, when he found them deserted, the enemy having left all their cannon, stores, tents, horses, and waggons in his hands. Even the steam-boat and nine barges the fugitives had used to cross the river were found uninjured.

It is computed that 275 Confederates were killed and wounded, while the Federal loss is acknowledged to have been heavy, one regiment having had seventy-five killed and wounded. General Zollicoffer's body is in the hands of the victors. General Schoepf is a Hungarian refugee, and when the war broke out was holding the humble position of messenger in the Patent Office at Washington.</p>

less mud of the Virginia roads. The health of General M'Clellan,
though improved, does not yet enable him to be as active as he could
wish. Very little is said, of the sanitary condition of the army by
the journals. The Washington correspondent of the New York <hi rend="italic">Independent</hi>, however, draws a gloomy picture of the camp hospitals:-"Complaints are constantly made and rarely listened to by the proper

authorities. The regular hospitals within the district are in an excellent

condition, but the regimental and brigade hospitals in Virginia are in a

shocking state. The Sanitary Commission does not usually extend its care to them. In one of them eighty sick men have lain for weeks without bed, straw, sheet, or pillow. Beds and bedding are generally unknown to these places, and the girth of the benevolent never reach them. The sick soldiers pass through the most distressing and long continued fevers in their usual military clothes."

About 1000 prisoners have been exchanged by the two belligerent Governments.

Mass meetings of German citizens had been held in several places, to denounce the treatment received by General Sigel, of Missouri, at the hands of General Halleck. The resolutions denounced the narrow spirit of nativism with which the graduates of West Point were animated towards officers of European birth and education.</p>

<p>Ex-President Tyler died at Richmond on the 17th ult. after a very

<p>A report from New Orleans says that a large meeting of the French

residents was held on the 10th ult, to devise some means of leaving the

Confederate States. A committee was appointed to communicate with

the Federal forces at Ship Island on the subject.</p>

<p rend="center">BRITISH OFFICERS EN ROUTE FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The British officers who passed through the United States en route for Canada were pleased with the courtesy extended towards them by

- the officials and the people; One of them who went out by the Canada, and arrived at Boston on the 10th ult., writes a follows:--

on landing the next-morning the English passengers were no lees
delighted than surprised to find that the sinister anticipations which
we had entertained of annoyance from the mob were so far from being
realised that we were<pb n="137"></pb>
received with the utmost politeness and courtesy. The whole of the baggage

was permitted to pass through the Custom House without examination, and in

no single instance was a passport demanded, while, accustomed as I am to the attention and courtesy which a stranger usually receives in an American city, I was most agreeably astonished, so soon after the surrender of the Commissioners, and in the very place of their late imprisonment, to be welcomed with a friendliness and a warmth which left nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>On the journey from Boston to Buffalo by the New York Central

Railway and its connections, the "conversation of the passengers on the

topic of the day confirmed the opinion which I had formed at Boston,

that a great reaction had set in in favour of England."</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The State Legislature, which meets at Sacramento city, had
adjourned to allow the water to subside. The people of San Francisco
had sent aid to the distressed citizens in cooked provisions and
clothing. The American River, on which the city lies, rose at one time
fifty feet. Very heavy rains continued to fall, and it was expected
that the annual gold products of California[sic] would be reduced by
millions of dollars. Oregon and Washington Territory had been
similarly visited.</p></div2>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">ELLIGERENTS IN BRITISH PORTS.</hi>-An important letter: has

been addressed by Earl Russell to the Lords of the Admiralty laying
down very stringent rules with regard to American vessels of war or
privateers which may enter BritiSh ports. No such vessels will be
permitted to enter any port of the Bahama Islands without special
leave of the Lieutenant Governor ; and with reference to all British
ports, whether in the United Kingdom or in the colonies, the vessels
alluded to will not be allowed to obtain any of the facilities for
warlike equipment; and, when a ship belonging to one belligerent has
sailed, twenty-four hours must elapse before a ship belonging to the
other belligerent may also leave the harbour.The first result of these
instructions has been to get rid of the two visitors who have so long
outstaid their welcome in Southampton waters. The Nashville is off,
and the Tuscarora after her. The Tuscarora put to sea on Saturday,
returning to Yarmouth Roads on Monday morning. Captain Peagram, taking
advantage of her return, at once notified to the Admiralty of his
intention to sail, and thus obtained the twenty-four hours' start of
his adversary. The Nashville steamed out on Monday afternoon, and when
last seen she had made the passage of the Needles, and was  "standing
away for sea with all sail." A despatch states that the frigate
Shannon had taken up a position near the Federal ship Tuscarora, with
the view of preventing her from following the Nashville before the
expiry of the twenty-four hours prescribed. Captain Peagram and his
officers seem to have kept their secret well, nothing whatever being
known as to the destination of the Nashville. A large steamer has been
seen off Cape Clear. She showed neither colours nor name, but from her
general appearance and movements she was suspected to be either a Federal or a Confederate war-vessel.</p></div2>

<p>Meantime we may record that in the fortunes of the American War
there appears to have been, for the first time, a change in favour of
the North. An engagement has taken place in Somerset County, in the
State of Kentucky, where the Confederates, with a comparatively small
force, made a dash to break the line which the Northern Generals seem
to be seeking to draw around their antagonists. The fight was
protracted, and, as usual, the numbers of the slain are in curiously
small proportion to that of the combatants and of the hours during
which the struggle is said to have "raged." But at length the death of
the Southern General and a decided movement by the overpowering force
of the North turned the day, and the Confederates fled, leaving their
slain and many of their wounded. The Commander-in-Chief has had other
foes to deal with, and has actually been compelled to submit to an
examination before a Congress Committee as to his plans of the
campaign. It is satisfactory to learn that the intelligent civilians
who sat in judgment on General M'Clellan were pleased to admit that he
seemed to know whathe was about, and certified to the people that
there was no cause at present for interfering with the young
Napoleon. Certain of the organs of the South write in rather a despairing way as to the condition of its army; but there is no sign of compromise, and no doubt the strongest efforts will be made to hold out until it can be ascertained whether France and England, or either, will interpose by mediation or by an infraction of the blockade.</p>

<p>A semi-ministerial admission that the three Powers-England, France,
and Austria-disbelieve in the fitness of Mexico for self-government,
and that two of them will take an active part in the establishment of
a monarchy under an Austrian Archduke, has occasioned considerable
"sensation ;" but as the topic must receive ample consideration in
both Houses of Parliament it may be well to delay judgment upon this
new and bold measure. Were the Northern States at peace, we imagine that so unceremonious a disregard of the Monroe doctrine would rouse a storm which under existing circumstances it may be convenient to postpone. </p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE QUEEN'S SPEEECH</p>

<p> M<hi rend="italic">Y LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,</hi></p>

<p>We are commanded by her Majesty to assure you that her Majesty is

persuaded that you will deeply participate in the affliction by which her

Majesty has been overwhelmed by the calamitous, untimely, and irreparable

loss of her beloved consort, who has been her comfort and support.</p>

<p>It has been, however, soothing to her Majesty, while suffering most acutely under this awful dispensation of Providence, to receive from all classes of her subjects the most cordial assurances of their sympathy with her sorrow, as well as of their appreciation of the noble character of him the greatness of whose loss to her Majesty and to the nation is so justly and so universally felt and, lamented.</p>

<p>We are commanded by her Majesty to assure you that she recurs with

confidence to your assistance and advice.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's relations with all the European Powers continue to be friendly and satisfactory; and her Majesty trusts there is no reason to apprehend any disturbance of the peace of Europe.</p>

<p>A question of great Importance, and which might have led to very serious consequences, arose between her Majesty and the Government of the United States of North America, owing to the seizure and forcible removal of four passengers from on board a British mail-packet by the commander of a ship of war of the United States; but that question has been satisfactorily settled, by the restoration of the passengers to British protection and by the disavowably the United States' Government of the act of violence committed by their naval officer.</p>

 <p>The friendly relations between her Majesty and the President of the United

States have therefore remained unimpaired.</p>

<p>Her Majesty warmly appreciates the loyalty and patriotic spirit
which have been manifested on this occasion by her North American
subjects.</p>

<p rend="center">HER MAJESTY' SPEECH.-THE ADDRESS.</p>

<p>>The Royal Speech having been read by the Lord Chancellor and again by the clerk at the table,</p>

<p>Lord D<hi rend="smallcaps">UFFERIN</hi> moved an Address In reply, which, as usual, was a mere

echo of the Speech from the Throne. Adverting to America, he pointed out the ties of Interest and parentage which bound us to the United States, and

expressed his approval of the neutral attitude,the Government had assumed  very outbreak of the civil war now desolating that country. He regarded the disputes which had arisen between the Northern and Southern States as the result of an incompatibility of temper but, at the same time, he held that her Majesty's Government, in the wise precautions they had taken to protect the vast commercial interests of the nation and to maintain unimpaired the prestige of our naval prowess, had received the full sympathies of every British subject. Amid loud cheers from all sides of the House, he briefly adverted to the patriotism, and determined spirit which had been manifested by Canada when a war with the United States appeared even more than imminent. In conclusion, he expressed a hope that the course her Majesty's Government had taken, in conjunction with France and Spain, in reference to the state of Mexico, would result in the establishment of order and the resumption of commercial tranquillity.</p>

<p>The Earl of S<hi rend="smallcaps">HELBURNE</hi> briefly seconded the Address.</p>

<p>The Earl of D<hi rend="smallcaps">ERBY</hi> concurred with the mover
and seconder of the Address in the tribute they had paid to the memory
of Prince Albert; and said he felt that the peculiar circumstances under which they had met rendered it most desirable that there should be no unnecessary differences of opinion. With regard to the American difficulty, he was bound to admit that her Majesty's Government had no alternative in the course they had taken. The moment they found that the act of Captain Wilks was not sanctioned by international law, a grave, serious, and imperative duty devolved upon them from which they could not shrink. However great sight be the horrors of war, far greater must be the ignominy of forfeiting the honour of the country. He deeply regretted the course which the Federal Government had taken, because, although they had assented to the just demands of this country, they had done so with a very ill grace, though feeling that they were in the wrong and had placed themselves, their Government, and their people in a position of undeserved humiliation. They had yielded not to their own sense of justice but to a demand by force, because they knew that this country would be satisfied with no less. Yet, though he approved the course the Government had taken in reference to the American difficulty, he thought they ought to be cautious how they entered upon negotiations which had for their object an alteration in the principles upon which international law was now regulated.</p>


<p>Earl G<hi rend="smallcaps">RANVILLE</hi> expressed his satisfaction at the course which Lord Derby

had taken, and said that throughout the whole of the differences with the

American Government her Majesty's Government had entertained but one

desire, and that was the preservation of the neutrality of the country, so far

as the internecine disputes with America were concerned, but not at
the cost of dishonour to the British name. The moment the outrages
upon the Trent occurred the Government felt that they had, but one
duty to perform, end that was instant and satisfactory reparation; and
it afforded him the utmost pleasure to find that in the course they
had taken they had been unanimously supported by the feelings of the country.

Earl R<hi rend="smallcaps">USSELL</hi> stated that all the papers which related to the American

difficulty and to the affairs of Mexico should at an early day be laid
before Parliament. He expressed his satisfaction at the manner in
which the efforts of the Government to maintain the honour of the
British flag had been supported by the country, and drew a contrast
between the unanimity which prevailed on the present occasion with
what had, been the course adopted in former times when, whatever might
be the proposition which might be submitted by the Ministers, it would
be sure to meet with the dissent of the Opposition. Adverting to the
present position of American affairs, he stated that there could be no
doubt, from the rapid success which had attended the efforts of the
Confederates to break the blockade, that it was of a most ineffectual
character, but at the same time the Government had no desire to press
hardly on the Northern States, but hoped that they would be able
themselves to settle their difficulties with the Southerners. Whether
this struggle ended in the total disruption or in more firmly
cementing the Union, her Majesty's Government would feel that they had
done their duty to both sides by preserving a strict neutrality.</p></div3>

<p rend="center"> HER MAJESTY'S SPEECH.-THE ADDRESS.</p>

<p>The Speaker having read her Majesty's most gracious speech,</p>

<p>Mr.<hi rend="smallcaps">PORTMAN,</hi> who was received with cheers, rose to move that an humble

Address be presented to her Majesty in answer to her most gracious Speech.</p>

<p>He remarked that there was one question of deep importance which might have led to serious consequences, and that was the differences which had arisen between this country and the United States. The pacific conclusion of the question was, he believed, due to the prompt and vigorous measures which had been taken by her Majesty's Government. The insult was one

  which no nation could have allowed to pass unatoned for. It was a breach

of international law and an insult to the British flag. But the course taken by her Majesty's Government was the one that was best calculated to maintain peace and to assert the dignity of this couutry. It was gratifying to find that the tone adopted by her Majesty's Government had been followed by the

- Government of the United States. He did not wish to say anything invidious

or irritating on this subject, but he might be permitted to remark that the

attitudes of the two peoples were essentially different-that, whilst
great numbers of the citizens of the United States were desirous of
pushing matters to extremity, the people of this country desired, in
the first instance, to ascertain the rights of the case, and, having
once done so, they evinced a stern determination to demand reparation,
and, if necessary, to enforce that reparation. Happily, the difficulty
had been settled without entering Into a war, and he was sure that the
course which had been pursued by her Majesty's Government had received
the full approval of the large majority of the nation. One of the
principal results which had followed the manifestation of feeling in
the United States had been the display of loyalty evinced by her
Majesty's subjects in British North America, showing that they could
appreciate the wise and liberal form of government under which they
lived and under which they enjoyed the fullest civil and religious
liberty. This country had received from our ally the Emperor of the
French a proof of friendship by the readiness with which he had expressed his concurrent opinion on this matter; and he believed that the prompt and unhesitating expression of that opinion had gone far towards the solution of the difficult question. It was gratifying to find that during this painful struggle we had preserved tho strictest economy; and, although he regretted the suffering and distress which existed amongst the manufacturing population, he believed the exigencies of the case would only give an additional impetus to British energy and be the means of opening new fields whence a sufficient supply of cotton could be derived. There was another result on which he might congratulate the House, and more particularly hon. gentlemen opposite,

,and that was the success which had attended the organisation of our

naval reserve.</p>
<p>Mr.<hi rend="smallcaps">DISRAELI</hi> expressed his conviction that
the information contained  in the Speech from the Throne, both upon
our domestic affairs and foreign relations, must be regarded with
satisfaction by the House at large. In the threatening aspect of
American affairs he most cordially recognized the propriety of the
course taken by her Majesty's Governmsnt in preserving a strict
neutrality; and he was proud of the dignified and honeurable attitude taken by her Majesty's Government towards the Northern States in the late difficulty, while he admitted that the American Government had, all things considered, met the question at issue in a fair and honorable manner. With regard to the dispute between the Northern and Southern States, he thought all that the former had a right to demand of this country was that we should not recognise the independence of the latter prematurely and without due consideration. Taken in connection with the interposition in the affairs of

Mexico, he considered this part of the question to be of the greatest im-portance, and he called upon the Government to lay before the House all the

information in their possession on the subject of the blockade. He
regarded the announcement made by the Government of their part in the
Mexican intervention with very great anxiety, for this country was the
first to recognise the independence of Mexico when she rebelled
against Spain; and, although it had at first been stated that the
grounds of interference were the insecurity of property and the non-settlement

of British claims much more extensive reasons had since been assigned.</p>

<p> Lord<hi rend="smallcaps"> PALMERSTON</hi> could not permit some of
the remarks made by the right hon. gentleman to pass unnoticed. With
regard to the dispute between the American States, the noble Earl at
the head of the Foreign Office had shown a discretion, a temper, and a
dignity which must be gratifying to the country--equal to the
occasion, and not exceeding it. Prom the outset of the dispute her
Majesty's Government had preserved a strict neutrality, and from that
strict neutrality it was not their intention to depart. They regretted
the commercial and manufacturing distress to which the unhappy state
of affairs had given rise in England; but they were not prepared,
because of that distress, to depart from the course of conduct which
they had hitherto pursued.

With regard to the Mexican intervention her Majesty's Government had no

other motive of action than that which had been openly assigned, and
were no party to any, design of changing the form of government and
imposing upon the Mexican people a form of government which might not
be acceptable to them.</p></div2>

</bibl>
<p>But with that audacity which seems

to be the common characteristic of Transatlantic Republics, Mexican
Governments of every party have been foremost in pillaging, insulting,
threatening, and even taking the lives of foreign residents. No
international obligations have been allowed to stand in the way of the
President for the time being, or of his creatures. Europeans have been
mercilessly fleeced, as such, by forced loans. Consuls have been
ill-treated, and their national archives ransacked. Promises have been
made but to be broken. Solemn stipulations have been recklessly
violated, and at length, under the seeming connivance of the party in
power, the design was openly entertained of ridding the country of all
foreign residents, and, of course, of confiscating and appropriating all their property within reach. Several causes contributed to indispose the leading European Powers to call Mexico to account. The extreme jealousy of the United States of any interference with the affairs of the New by the Powers of the Old World-the mutual distrust by the latter of each other's ultimate designs-the fear lest some complication of practical policy in the Western Hemisphere might eventuate in hostilities in the Eastern, and the expense of reducing Mexican anarchy, prevailed to lengthen out the patient endurance of European Governments. Outrage became at last intolerable, at least in the judgment of the allies, and, after considerable negotiation, England, France, and Spain agreed to, a convention by which they pledged themselves to united action for the purpose of wringing satisfaction and redress from the lawless Republic.</p>

<p>Any one of the allied Powers could have reduced Mexico to reason with
the utmost ease; but it seems to have been thought that any one of
them operating singly might turn success to a selfish account. The
convention, therefore, must be regarded as a document intended to
impose restraint upon the assailants, and not made necessary by the
strength of the assailed. Each of the contracting Governments
renounces all intention of permanent conquest, and the redress that
they seek they engage to seek in common, and not separately, or at
each other's expense. Spain has been somewhat suspiciously eager for
the fray. Her forces were first on the scene of action, and the port
of Vera Cruz and the fortress of San Juan d'Ulloa are already in the
occupation of the allies. Mexican Generals, however, although capable
of surrendering strongholds without a blow, are equally capable of
offering a show of desperate resistance where it is plainly of no
avail. The latest intelligence prepares us to expect that intestine
feuds will be momentarily buried, and exhausted Mexico will defy the
arms of the three allied Powers. So affairs stood when information from that quarter was last dispatched.</p>

<p> Meanwhile, however, a novel aspect of the case has turned up for
 discussion. The design seems to have been somewhere entertained of
 putting an end to Mexican confusion by converting the Republic into a
 Monarchy, and placing the Archduke Maximilian, of the house of
 Austria, on the throne. Happily, as we think, the conditions laid
 down by this illustrious scion of an Imperial house as indispensable
 to his acceptance of the honour are such as will be found
 impracticable. Not that we regard Monarchy as an institution wholly
 unsuited to Mexico, especially in her present state, nor that we
 associate with the Austrian Archduke all the faithlessness which has
 characterised the family of which he is a member. Had the project
 originated in Mexico, or received the undoubted sanction of the
 nation, we can well believe that it might have eventuated in a
 permanent settlement of Mexican affairs, and a rapid development of
 the unbounded resources of that splendid territory. But for any such
 arrangement to have been the outcome of European intrigue, aiming at
 not so much what is thought best for Mexico, but what may be most
 convenient for European diplomacy, would be fatal to its success. Royalty forced upon the people of Mexico might possibly overawe them, but would not engage their hearty allegiance; and one can easily imagine what would be the inevitable fate of the new kingdom in the course of a few years, whether the Confederate States of America establish their independence or whether the United States be again restored to an unbroken Federation. Mexican institutions must represent Mexican sentiments, or the country will inevitably and speedily be absorbed by her powerful and

anti monarchic neighbour.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the North American we have telegrams from New

<p rend="center">THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.</p>


<p>This expedition, consisting of 125 vessels of all classes, started
from Hampton Roads, in Chesapeake Bay, on the 11th and 12th
ult. Encountering heavy fogs and severe storms, they did not arrive at
Hatteras until the 15th. The screw-steamer New York ran on the bar at
the entrance to the harbour and soon became a total wreck. All hands
were saved; but her cargo, consisting of 200,000 doll. worth of
powder, rifles, and bombs, was totally lost. The gun-boat Zouare and
the steamer Pocahontas were also wrecked near the lighthouse. Ninety
valuable horses belonging to the Rhode Island Battery had to be thrown overboard. Several tow-boats, and schooners laden with provisions, were wrecked. No lives were lost except those of thm Colonel and surgeon of a New Jersey regiment and a mate, through the swamping of a life-boat. Up to the 26th ult. General Burnside had made no advance beyond Hatteras Bar. The precise object of the expedition still remains undisclosed to the public.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL VICTORY IN SOUTHERN KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>General Thomas's official report of the battle at Mill Spring has

been published. The affair was as decisive as the first reports represented it to be. A war correspondent thus describes the manner in which the Confederate General Zollicoffer met his death:-

At the point of the V died General Z. He fell, nearer our camp than
any other man of his army. He was with Battle's regiment, his own home friends,

 born and brought up around him at Nashville. A short distance from him

to his right, a party of his men had been broken from their comrades and

were herding together like frightened deer. Colonel Fry's men (loyal Ken-

tuckians) were just about to fire on them. Colonel Fry himself was at the

right of his regiment, at the point of greatest danger. General
Zollicoffer was on foot, and within a few feet of the
Colonel. A. gunboat concealed his uniform. Seeing the condition of his men, as the Colonel rode up, General

Z. said, "Colonel, you would not fire upon your friends, would you?"
Colonel F. supposed from the General's manner and remark that he was
one of our

own officers, and at once replied, "Certainly not, Sir; I have no such
intention." He turned and rode a few steps, when one of the General's aides fired

at him, wounding his horse. Believing that he was tricked, Colonel Fry at

once wheeled and fired at the General with his revolver. The latter
raised his

<p>The proceedings in Parliament have as yet had little of interest. The orations on the opening evening were chiefly addressed to the one melancholy topic with a reference to which the Royal Speech began.</p>

<p>America, of course, came in for a share in the opening discussions. The Opposition heartily approved of all that the

Government has done, and Lord Derby took pains twice to

correct a report that made him express a belief that we should soon have to recognise the Southern Confederacy. Mr. Disraeli spoke more favourably than his chief in regard to the Government of the Northern States, and said that they had dealt manfully with the great difficulty presented by the secession; and he therefore thought that any communication from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet should be received in a generous spirit. The prudent reticence which characterised both Houses last Session as regarded American affairs is likely to be imitated, although in the Lords more than one nobleman has expressed himself strongly upon the conduct of the Lincoln Government towards England, and although an endeavour will be made to fix Lord Palmerston to some definite expression of opinion on the sufficiency of the blockade.</p>

<p>We do not learn much from the latest mails from New York touching the last battle; but it is clear that the Confederates

were worsted, and fled with considerable energy, but not until

after a fierce struggle of many hours. The battle must have been a desultory one, as is clear from the small number of the slain and also from the mode in which General Zollicoffer was killed, he and his friends having been riding about the field apparently with no express object, and having come upon another
small body of wanderers on the other side. Each body took the other
for friends until very near, and then a hand-to-hand fight ensued, and
the General was brought down by a shot from a revolver. All this looks
remarkably unlike an incident in a real battle, and indicates a sort
of guerrilla warfare. But the result as certainly unfavourable to the
South, and the victory is made the most of in New York. On the other
hand, the expedition along the coast met with an unfortunate check. A
vessel loaded with valuable munitions of war went on a rock and sunk;
and, though but few lives were lost, the ready lies of the telegraphic
correspondents magnified the affair so awfully that General M'Clellan
thought right to order the journals to call in the sheets in which
they had given the false intelligence. This they could not do, but
spread, in the contrary interest, the news that Government was
repressing intelligence, and by this means a panic was created. The
truth came out at last--the casualty was a severe one, but was merely
one of the accidents of war which are supposed to be included in the
calculations of every prudent General. Up to the present time,
therefore, the ninety days which were to end the campaign were melting
away without any remarkable advance towards the desired
object.</p></div2></div2>

there was any truth in the report as to the manner in which
Mr. Shepherd, a British subject, had been thrust into prison in New
York, and also his treatment while under confinement. It had been
stated that the letters addressed to him from the British Embassy had
been torn open, and that he had been pressed to renounce his
nationality and take the oath of allegiance to the United States in
order to facilitate his liberation. -Earl <hi

explanation furnished by Mr. Seward, Mr. Shepherd was considered a
citizen of the United States. He had been arrested on suspicion of
being a spy, and the American law, as interpreted by its law officers,
gave to the President in times of emergency the power of arrest. There
was no objection to lay the correspondence on the table.-The Earl of
<hi rend="smallcaps">CARNARVON</hi> was surprised to hear that the report was correct; and he hoped that when the correspondence was produced it would appear that the Government had not only remonstrated against the injustice,

but had claimed compensation for the imprisonment.</p>

compelled to take the same course in order to obtain their release
from imprisonment.-Earl R<hi rend="smallcaps">USSELL</hi> said that a
correspondence on the subject had taken place, and had been laid
before Parliament, and from that it would appear that the Federal
Government alleged that these persons had been engaged in treasonable
conspiracies, and, the President having exercised his legitimate right
in suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, he was not prepared to say that
the detention of those persons was illegal, or demanded more decided
Interference on the part of her Majesty's Goveroment.-Thco Earl of

could be quoted to justify the compelling of the subjects of one

<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">ARLIAMENTARY PAPERS CONCERING THE CIVIL WAR
IN AMERICA.</hi>--Several important Parliamentary papers were published yesterday

week. The first consists of correspondence relating to the civil war in America, chiefly between Lord Lyons and Lord Russell. This correspondence goes back

as far as Nov. 17, 1860, when the primary elections in the United States had

assured the elevation of Mr. Lincoln to the presidential chair. All
the mo-mentous events which have occurred in the interval are narrated
and dis-cussed. There is a long letter addressed to Lord Russell by
Messers. Yancey, Rost, and Manns, urging that the Confederate States
were entitled to be regarded as a Government de facto; and there are
other proofs of the activity of those gentlemen. No. 2 is a reprint of
the Amerinin Bluebook containing all the diplomatic correspondence
between Mr. Seward and the representatives of America at foreign
Courts. No. 3 contains the correspondence on the question of maritime
law which has been raised by the Transatlantic struggle. The fourth
paper is on time withdrawal by the United States of Mr. Bunch's
exequatur as Consul at Charleston; the fifth is on the seizure of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell; and the sixth relates to the Nashville and
Tuscarora.</p></div2>

<p>By the City of Washington we have advices from New York to the

8th inst. The only military operation of the week is the</p>

<p rend="center">C<hi rend="smallcaps">APTURE OF FORT HENRY.</hi></p>

<p>This Confederate fort is situated on the Tennessee River, in Western

Kentucky, not far from its mouth. On the 6th seven Federal gun

boats, under the command of Commodore Foote, attacked the fort,

and, after one hour and a quarter's bombardment, the Confederate

General Tilgheim and the garrison of sixty men surrendered uncon

ditionally. The fort contained twenty guns, and offered a
strong-resistance. The boiler of the gunboat Essex exploded, killing
thirty Federals. The Federal land forces did not arrive until after
the surrender. Fort Dennellson, on the Cumberland River, will be the
next point of attack.</p>

<p>The Burnside expedition has sailed for Roanoke Island.</p>
<p rend="center">FINANCE</p>

<p>The anxieties of the Secretary of the Treasury have been relieved by the passage of the Treasury Note Bill through the House of Representatives, with the clause making the notes a legal tender, by a large majority. The telegrams to the contrary were erroneous. The House of Representatives has added an amendment. making the payment of interest on Government Bonds optional in coin or paper.</p>

<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has unanimously passed resolutions to
sustain the Government in giving currency to the legal tender notes
until they can be placed on a specie basis by the imposition of taxes
adequate to their redemption. On the other hand, the people show no
revived disposition to invest in the National Loan, of which nearly
50,000,000 dols. remain on the hands of the Government. Gold is
3&#x00BD;prem.; the 7.30 Treasury notes are selling at a discount of
l&#x00BD; per cent; and the contractors are clamoring for payment. The Federal and State Treasuries, however, are most anxious to keep faith with the public creditor, and have paid the interest on the several National and State debts in coin. It is stated on high authority that the amount of the funded Federal debt was on the 15th of January 306,700,000 dols., having risen to thin amount-from 65,000,000 dols. since Mr. Lincoln's inauguration. This is irrespective of a large and daily- augmenting floating debt. The same authority estimates that by the end of this fiscal year (June 30) the funded and floating debt will amount to 650,000,000 dols.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>In the Senate, on the 31st ult., the resolution appropriating

35,000 dols. to forward the interests of American exhibitors at the

International Exhibition was rejected by the vote of--Ayes, 17;

Nays, 22. A bill to prohibit Americana engaging in the coolie trade passed the Senate. Mr. Bright, senator from Indiana, has been expelled from the United States' Senate for corresponding in the spring of last year with Mr. Jefferson Davis on the subject of gunpowder.</p>

<p> The House Committee on Commerce has reported on the Reciprocity

Treaty with Canada. The report deprecates the abrogation of the treaty, but advocates its amendment, with a view to benefit American industry. It affirms that while Canada draws from American imports a revenue of 1,000,000 dols., the United States only derives 25,000 dols. from duties on Canadian imports.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ADMINISTRATION.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has at length yielded to outside pressure and
ordered the removal of the captured privateersmen from a common gaol
to Fort Lafayette, where they are to betreated as ordinary prisoners
of war. A flag of trace from General Johnston, of the Confederate
Army, with<orig reg="dispatches"> despatches</orig> for the President had been received. It is

supposed that it relates to the exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p>The President has granted a respite of three weeks to Captain Gordon, of the slaver Erie, who was to have been hung on the 7th inst. Judge Cowles has written a letter to the President begging him to commute the sentence of death.</p>

<p>The Maine Senate having requested the Governor of that State to

demand explanations of Mr. Seward for his offer to pass British troops
across that state, the Secretary of State replies, in a long letter,
that the immediate grounds of the proceeding were the saving the
persons concerned from risk and suffering which might be feared if
they were left to make their way, in an inclement season, through the
ice and snow of a northerly Canadian voyage. It was a customary act of
comity such as the United States' Government receives from New Grenada
whenever it passes troops across the isthmus:--</p>

<p><q rend="blockquote">The United States have not only
studiously<orig reg="practiced"> practised</orig>orig> the meet perfect
justice in their intercourse with Great Britain, but they have also
cultivated on their part a spirit of friendship towards her as a
kindred nation, bound by the peculiar ties of commerce. The Grand
Trunk Railroad, a British highway, extended through the territories of
the United States to perhaps the finest seaport of our country is a monument of their friendly disposition. The reciprocity treaty, favouring the productions of British North America in the markets of the United States, is a similar monument of the same wise and benevolent policy. I shall net affect ignorance of the fact that popular asperities have recently appeared in that portion of the British Empire, as well as in the British Islands, which have seemed to indicate a growing alienation of sentiment among portions of the British people. But the Government of Great Britain has nevertheless, during all this time, held towards us its customary language of respect and friendship. This Government, practising entire frankness, yields its full faith to these assurances. The popular asperities to which I have alluded are believed to have had their origin in accidents and misapprehensions of a temporary character. While the policy of this Government has been to fortify its territories so as to be able to resist all foreign as well as domestic enemies, if such enemies must come, it has been equally careful at the same time to secure even greater strength by showing itself consistent in all things, scrupulously just, and, if possible, magnanimous towards all other nations.</q></p>

 <p>If, however, Mr. Seward concludes, the State of Maine feels herself

aggrieved, the orders will be cheerfully modified</p>.

<p rend="center">CONFEDERATE REPORT ON BULL RUN</p>

<p>General Beauregard's official report on the battle of Bull Run has

been published, The loss of the Confederates was 1800 killed and

wounded. The effective Confederate force engaged was 21,000 men

and twenty-nine guns. The report concludes as follows:-</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is doubtless expected that through this report my countrymen should be made acquainted with some of the sufficient causes that prevented the advance of our forces and prolonged vigorous pursuit of the enemy to and beyond the Potomac. The War Department has been fully advised long since of all those canoes, some of which only are proper to be here communicated. An army which had fought like ours on that day against uncommon odds, under a July eon, most of the time without water and without food, except a hastily snatched meal at dawn, was not in the condition for the toil of an eager, effective pursuit of an enemy immediately after the battle. On the following day an unusually heavy and unintermitting fall of rain intervened to obstruct our advance. Added to this, the want of a sufficient cavalry force made an effective pursuit a military impossibility.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Russell, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent, has quitted the United

States for the purpose of making a tour of inspection in Canada.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the assurances from Washington correspondents

that the Federal Government has perfect faith in the friendly assurances

offered to it by the leading Governments of Western Europe, the New York press obstinately persist in representing that an intervention by France and Great Britain will take place on or before the 1st of April next.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan has forbidden the Hutchinsons to sing their antislavery songs in camp and has ordered them back to Washington.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Michigan has sent a petition to Congress stating that as slavery is the cause of the war it should be swept from the land.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Anti-slavery Society have had their annual

neeting without any of the usual disturbances.</p>

<p>During the week 173 bales of Government Sea Island cotton have

been sold at from 28c. to 71c. per pound, the average price being 55c.

Nine bales of Uplands were sold at 25c. to 26&#x00BD;c.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Owing to the continuance of the floods, the Legislature of this State have adjourned from Sacramento City to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made to send telegrams direct from

Halifax, Nova Scotia, to San Francisco. </p>

<p>Public opinion in the Northern States appears to be calling
peremptorily for action on the part of the military authorities; and
journals which are usually well-disposed towards the Government do not
scruple to declare that unless something be done towards the
subjugation of the South it will be difficult to protest much longer
against the interference of other nations. The call seems to be heard,
and a simultaneous movement of three forces, intended to clear
Kentucky of the Southern troops, is announced. Again, we are told that
another fortnight will bring us great news. Mr. Jefferson Davis was to
be inaugurated as First President of the South on this day (the 22nd),
and has selected the especial sacred volume on which "his lips shall
be pressed" in ratification of his vow to protect the system of
man-stealing and man-selling. The great consideration with the North
is, of course, money; and, provided this can be found, it is most
probable that the long and magnificent preparations made by General
M'Clellan will enable him to strike an important blow, one which will
satisfy the honour of the North and permit Mr. Lincoln to listen to
terms of compromise. A strange rumour is, however, promulgated, to the
effect that the President and his War Secretary design to take the
responsibility of commanding the advancing army, while General
M'Clellan will be left to act upon the Potomac. We mention this
because it is gravely asserted in several journals, but the statement does not seem very truthful.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE SEIZURE OF THE TRENT.</hi>-On the motion
for going into Committee of Supply on the Supplemental Estimates (Army
and Navy), Mr. B<hi rend="smallcaps">RIGHT</hi>, in a speech of some
length, adverted to the affair of the Trout. He expressed his approval
of the tone adopted by Lord Russell in the despatches which he had
addressed to the British Minister at Washington, but entirely
dissented from the policy of warlike preparation, the root of which
the country was now required to defray. He defended the American
Government from the imputation of being under the influence of a mob,
showed how the menaces which had been indulged in had paralysed trade
even to its farthest ramifications, and asserted that the real
interests of this country and the progress of human freedom were bound
up with the cause of the Federal States.-Mr. B<hi
rend="smallcaps">AXTER</hi>, while approving of the preparations made
by the Government, urged that the North American colonies, whose
wealth and public spirit had been made conspicuous by recent events,
should pay the expense of their own military establishments.-Lord P<hi
rend="smallcaps">ALMERSTON</hi> defended the Government from the
imputations of Mr. Bright. The policy which her Majesty's Government
had pursued in reference to the affair of the Trent had met with the
general approval of the country, because it was obvious that no other
course could have been adopted to assert the honour and independence
of the country. If the American Government really felt that they were
bound by their own principles of international law to give up the
Confederate Commissioners, why did they wait for a remonstrance from
England, and why had they kept them for several weeks in prison? Her
Majesty'e Government had no information to lead them to believe that
the prisoners who had been taken out of the Trent would have been given up. On<lb/>
the contrary, they were bound to arrive at an opposite conclusion, for
Captain Wilks had been converted into a hero, and his act had been
applauded at a public banquet, and had been commended by the House of
Representatives and the Department of the Admiralty. So far from her
Majesty's Government  having incurred the censure of the House or the
country, he submitted that

they would have deserved the displeasure of both if they had simply
rested their case upon a demand and had taken no steps to extort
redress by the usual means. The Government had done what they
conceived to be their duty, and, although they had done no more than
their duty, they believed they had given expression to the feelings of
the country at a moment of no ordinary difficulty.</p></div2>

ceration he considered compensation should have been
demanded.--Earl R<hi rend="smallcaps">USSELL</hi> in reply, said that
Mr. Shaver had made no application to him for compensation. The gist
of the case was whether this gentleman had or had not rendered
assistance to the Confederates, as alleged by Mr. Seward. The noble
Lord, in answer to the objection that the President had been guilty of
an unwarrantable stretch of authority, said that the power of
suspending the writ of habeas corpus was vested in him.</p></div2>

<p rend="right">On Board the Guide, Hatteras Inlet,</p>
<p rend="right"> North Caroline, Jan. 22.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day on which I dated my last letter from the
Picket we arrived at Fortress Monroe, accompanied by most of the ships
composing the Burnside expedition, only half a dozen or so being
delayed by the fog. The latter joined the fleet on the following
morning in Hampton Roads with the exception of the John Trucks, which
had got on shore in the Chesapeake, and had not been got off up to the time of our leaving; she had the Epeneuil Zouaves on board. There has been so much said of Fortress Monroe by others at various times during the present campaign, and especially by Mr. Russell, that there is little or nothing left for me to bore your readers with in reference to this famous American stronghold. Neither have I made you a sketch of the place, which is singularly inappropriate for illustration, beng nothing more than an intrenched camp on a low spit of sand, but immensely strong for all that. Besides, we spent but

little time there, and that was all confusion of preparation for
departure for our unknown destination. The secret had been well
kept. Not a soul, except the General-in-Chief and perhaps Commodore
Gouldsborongh, had an inkling of our<hi rend="italic"> feuille de
route</hi>, though manifold were the conjectures of those with whom I
was thrown in contact. I heard every place mentioned, from Galveston,
in Texas, up to the York River and the Rappahannock, and some even
supposed we were bound up the Potomac to clear out the Confederate
batteries at Evansport and Shipping Point. But this state of
uncertainty, was not to last long, as the officer commanding the
troops on each ship had sealed orders given him, which were to be
opened after getting six miles to sea. Well, we arrived, as I have
said, at the place of rendezvous off Fortress Monroe, on the evening of the 10th inst., and we weighed anchor on the following night at 11 p.m. My vessel was the Picket, a screw, the smallest in the fleet, on which General

 Burnside had established his head-quarters, much against the wish

of every one, for, although she was perfectly new, her proportions were scarcely those of a ship fitted to cope with a heavy sea. Before leaving there were all kinds of discomfiting prognostications about the weather. Old pilots shook their heads end prophesied north-easters; anxious groups surrounded the barometer and reported it going down rapidly, while evil crokers foretold worse disasters than happened to Sherman's expedition on its way to Port Royal. But matters had been already delayed too long, and so it was anchor apeak and away despite ancient mariners and mercurial oracles. As I had been invited to accompany the General, and had accepted, of course we rowed in the same boat; where he went there should I go but I must confess I should have preferred his choosing a large steamer instead of the mite of a cockleshell we were embarked in. Well, when we had got six miles down the roads towards Cape Henry, the General gave instructions to our Captain to shape his course for Hatteras, and then, for the first time, I became aware of our destination. We were to pass over the bulkhead of Pamlico Sound and attack the Confederate position at Roanoke Island; and, if successful in this, to advance on New Berne, and thus form a basis from which to make approaches towards the centre of North Carolina, occupying the different lines of rails, and cutting off the communications of the Secessionists on the Potomac with the Southern seaboard States. To do this we had a force of something like 16,000 men, and afleet of a hundred transports and store-ships, including fourteen or fifteen small river steamers fitted as gun-boats to act in shallow water.</p>

<p>Woe is me&#x0021;  There was more in the prognostications of the old pilot and barometer than we were willing to admit, for on rounding Cape Henry we got into the trough of a real Atlantic sea, and found the breeze rapidly freshening into a gale. For a moment we all thought we were going to "turn turtle," and I, who had just laid down on a couch in the deck-cabin, was hurled against the door, which burst open with the concussion and shot me through it into the lee scuppers, where I rolled about in six or eight inches of the wholesome briny. At the present moment I am greatly confused as to the evolutions we performed in that one great lurch, followed, alas&#x0021; by many after ones; but I cannot help thinking we stood on the funnel for at least five minutes. When at last I collected my battered remains together I found a party of anxious, lightly-clad, shivering individuals holding on to stanchions and ropes. However, the captain got her head to it and matters were somewhat improved, and the little Picket struggled forward very much after the fashion that some gentlemen do returning home late from a dinner party. I groped my way back to my couch over the ruins of the steward's crockery, and, by a judicious use of padding, succeeded in wedging myself in

 tight, and so slept soundly till morning.</p>
<p> Day dawned with a thick fog hod a heavy swell on. Now and then the misty veil would rise and give us occasional glimpses of the coast of North Carolina, arid, uninviting, end desolate in appearance: nothing more than a succession of hummocks of sand, jotted here and there with the skeleton timbers of many good ships cast away on the inhospitable shore. Towards evening the wind blew a perfect gale from S.S.W., making the eating of one's dinner exceedingly problematical. The only way of taking in supplies was to hold on by one hand and watch the opportunity of feeding with the other. Two of the party, after the first spoonful of soup, betrayed unmistakable signs of a loathing of food, causing "the steward to hasten with the necessary basin ;" but, with the characteristic obstinacy of people attacked with their complaint, they repudiated anything being the matter with them, and, by delaying their exit till the supreme moment, overreached themselves and those sitting beside them.</p>
<p>Oh dear&#x0021; I wish there were no such things as naval expeditions for

correspondents to go upon. Before I get through with this letter I

shall have to relate experiences that will make your readers think I am

romancing; and this suspicion will hardly repay me for the misery I

have endured during the last fortnight. Not a day has passed that it
has not blown a gale, diversified by an occasional hurricane and a
wreck or two. But belay there&#x0021; as we nautical men say, and let
me spin my yam in a methodical manner. Well, as I was saying, towards
evening it blew a gale of wind, and then we found out our mistake in
going to sea in a little river steamer like the Picket. The only good
that the gale did us was to blow away the fog-banks that ever and anon
enveloped us in their damp and opaque folds, giving us a chance to
judge our whereabouts. But, alas&#x0021; it also brought us many
ills. The "white horses" raced madly over the ever-increasing mounds
of green water that piled themselves on our bows, a heaving barrier to
our progress. Vastly the little vessel dipped and staggered forward;
before she could rise to one sea another would strike her and send her
reeling back, spars and hull trembling from each successive blow. We
had barely sufficient power to keep her head to it, and, as all hands
held on, there were many anxious glances at the coming wave, speeding
along as though it would engulf us on its way. About midnight we saw
the lights of a steamer half a mile distant on our port bow, and to
attract the attention of those on board we fired a totted gun astern
of her, which had the effect of bringing her within speaking
distance. She turned out to be the Eastern Queen, a large ship
belonging to the expedition; and, as she rose and fell within crushing
proximity, we hailed her Captain to lie by us till daylight. Not a
soul on board closed their eyes in sleep during the long dark bouts
that waned not. Once I thought we were gone, for, while clutching the
after-davits, I found myself buried in the sea up to my waist, the
gunwales rolling completely under. In that one moment I recollected
the most trivial occurrences of my earliest boyhood; thirty years of
unimportant existence flashed through my mind. But this mental
biography was brought to an abrupt termination by the return jerk of
the vessel, which wrenched me from my hold and deposited me, with a
bruised head, amongst a pile of ammunition-boxes. Day broke with a
leaden sky, against which the angry, white-crested waves raced their
mad career over the reefs of Cape Hatteras, that threw its headland
oceanwards but eight miles distant. From our hurricane deck fourteen
steamers could be seen labouring to weather this storm-point. How
should we fare with our small-powered engine and cockleshell boat?
Bravely we breasted on staggering beneath the giant blows of each
successive sea, our decks swept fore and aft and all on board reeling
from side to side like drunken men. One figure stood immovable
grasping by the bits, scanning the horizon for traces of ships as we
rose on each glittering mass of foam. It was the square, manly form of
General Burnside, whose anxiety for the fate of his army was intense,
many of the vessels on<lb/> which the troops were embarked being
nothing more than huge top-hampered river steamers, with projecting
guards that would smash up like cardboard if fairly struck by a
sea. But, happily, as we and the day advanced, more wreathy lines of
smoke indicated the approach of others of the fleet; and oh, good
fortune&#x0021; by 11 a.m. we had weathered the cape and were hove to
off Hatteras Bar, waiting for the little black tug-boat that was
steaming out to pilot us in. Without exaggeration, I may state the
height of the breakers through which the narrow channel ran to have
been nearly, if not quite twenty feet, with a depth of thirteen feet
in the deepest part. The Picket was the first to venture over, closely
followed by the Peabody and Eastern City, and having on her starboard
quarter the pilot-tug. So awful was the entourage of hissing breakers,
and so certain our destruction should we yaw off but a point or two
either way, that this was probably the most hazardous period of our
tempestuous voyage. The Sketch I send (engraved on page 187) is
faithful to the truth, and will better illustrate our position than
anything I can express in writing. By midday we were over and at
anchor in Pamlico Sound, under shelter of a spit of sand which up to
the present constitutes the entire Federal department of North
Carolina. On this land, partially submerged at high water, are built
the forts captured by Commodore Stringham and General Butler last
August or early in September, I forget which; but to my mind the
greatest harm that could have been done the Confederates would have
been to leave them quietly in possession of this God-forsaken
spot. Please, as the showman says, to turn to the other Sketch
(engraved on page 186), and judge for yourself if such a place is fit
for habitation by aught save clams and muscles. But the occupation has
been of great advantage to the Federal Government as it has
effectually placed a seal upon the outlets of Albemarle and amlico
Sounds, shutting in the few vessels the Southerners have<hi rend="italic"> dans ces parages.</hi></p><p>

 It was on the 18th inst. that we cast our anchor in the waters of

Secessia, fourscore vessels drifting and crashing into each other in

a harbour, if so it can be designated, scarcely large enough to float
a dozen comfortably. At one moment the little Picket had three huge
floating barracks blown on to her in a heap, making it extremely
probable we should drag to sea together and go to pieces on the
bar. Everybody on board worked with a will; axes and hand-spikes were
in every hand, assisting to clear away the surrounding wreck; and your
correspondent as he sprang for the chains of the Northerner, grasping
a fender to ease off the shock as she closed in missed his footing,
and was only rescued from being flattened out like a pancake by the
activity of some soldiers who dragged him up the side a second before
the collision took place.</p>

</p>

<p>The great difficulty to be contended against in the harbour is the
shallowness of the water, except in certain places, and in these the ships are wedged together, with scarcely room to swing, and with the rush of the tide out from the Sound, or in from the ocean, assisted by incessant gales of wind, there is hardly a minute of the day that some vessel does not come to grief. About a mile up is the bulkhead, formed by a ridge of sandbanks,over which ,the gunboats and transports of lighter draught have to pass before they can advance to the attack of Roanoke Island. I foresee even now, though many are over (all the gun-boats are) that there will be great difficulty about this, for the vessel on which I am writing is stuck hard and fast, and thumping and humping in a howling northeaster. In answer to our signals for assistance the Commodore who has come down to take command of the naval portion of the expedition, replies that nothing at present can be done for us, as it is dangerous, and we must wait for the weather to moderate before any attempt can be made to relieve us. This is a very pleasant state of affairs, considering we have only four casks of water in the hold and no means of communicating with the store-ships. Fortunately we put our troops ashore to lighten us before attempting to cross, otherwise we should have been in a very bad condition indeed. I hope our timbers are sound and well riveted together, else I may expect to disappear through the floor beneath me, after the fashion of a pantomime trick, during one of the thumps. By-the-by, as I have digressed, I may as well mention here that General Burnside has changed his quarters from the Picket, and we are now on board a large steamer called the Guide. On the 14th, the day after our arrival, the City of New York struck on the bar, and in a short time became a total wreck (she is shown in the Illustration on page 186). Fortunately, the crew and those on board were saved in surfboats, but three other poor fellows attempting to reach the harbour in a launch from a weatherbound vessel outside got capsized in the breakers, and sank before our eyes: the oarsmen, who, luckily, had on life-preservers were picked up by a schooner. The three lost were the mate of the ship and the Colonel and Doctor of the New Jersey regiment. Among the disasters to be chronicled on this day is the sinking of the Zouave transport inside the inlet. She drifted on her anchor and stove in her bottom. Two or three tugs got round her and took off the men.</p>


<p> On the 15th we changed to the Guide, and had scarcely got

on board when a barque came crashing into her stem on, driving

her jibboom into our galley, and scattering the cooks and
pre-parations for dinner. On the 16th the wind changed from a gale of
wind from S.S.W. to a still harder blow from N.W., preventing us from
making any progress with the lightening of the ships that were to
cross the bulkhead. Measles were reported to have broken out on some
of the transports, with a few cases of fever. At dark all hands were
startled by the report of a heavy gun, and on reaching the hurricane
deck we saw a large brig drifting rapidly on to the bar. As it
grew-darker and her outline became less defined the excitement became
intense. It was evident to all she was in a most critical position,
and every moment might be her last. Slowly the black hull rose and
fell, each time gliding nearer and nearer to the vortex of white
breakers, which, once amongst, nothing we might attempt could save
her. Saddenly a fringe of musketry fire surrounded her bulwarks
blue-lights were burnt in her tops, and imagination brought us through the howling blasts the despairing shrieks of the terrified soldiers crowding her decks. Volley after volley succeeded each other in rapid succession, and yet apparently we could not help her; none dared face the tempest and, perhaps, share her doom. General Burnside boarded every steam-tug in the harbour; offered any reward, and also to go himself, but all held back. Were three hundred fellowmen to be launched into eternity, their death-cries in our ears, and yet no effort made to save them? Hurrah! one brave seaman volunteered to take his little steamer out, General Burnside jumped on board of her, but, at the earnest entreaties of his friends, he delegated the honour of the position to a member of his staff. Anxiously we watched her progress through the troubled waters, battling her way and wrestling with the waves as she advanced on her mission of mercy. Fortunately, she reached the bar before the brig had been thoroughly drawn into the breakers, and, getting a hawser to her, succeeded in rescuing her from her perilous position. When the steamer returned she had scarcely a vestige of bulwark or paddlebox left: all had been smashed and carried away by the force of the sea. In fact, each day has seen some narrow escape or bad disaster. There are at present four total wrecks and five or six vessels on shore, the last evil report being the loss of the Pocahontas, with ninety horses on board, twenty-five of which only were saved. The crew reached the shore by a warp.</p>

<p rend="right">Jan. 26.</p>

<p>With one exception, when it blew a topsail breeze, we have had a

continuous howl from all the points of the compass, making it next to

impossible to progress with the lightening of the vessels destined to
cross the bulkhead. Probably the greatest misfortune of all is the
non-arrival of six water-ships, on which we depended for supplies
after our ten days' rations had been consumed. The consequence is, the
entire fleet is on short allowance, with no immediate prospect of
relief, as in all probability the expected vessels have been lost
during the fearful hurricane that prevailed with unmitigated violence
for three days, and only ceased yesterday morning. During this time we
on board the Guide were thumping our bottom out on the bulkhead, and
have only just been got off, while at least a dozen other ships
displayed their colours, Union down. Most of these were suffering from
short allowance of everything, but no help could be given them till
the fury of the storm had abated. Our position was the most
problematical of all, as our safety simply depended on the strength of
the ship's timbers, and her power to endure the continuous straining
as she thumped from side to side in her bed of sand. This morning we have news of another wreck outside the spit. Numerous bodies have been washed on shore, but, as nothing remains of the vessel, we are ignorant whether<lb/>
she belonged to the expedition or not. The probability is she one of the missing water-schooners.</p>

<p>I have been here long enough to ascertain one fact, and that is,
with a few exceptions, General Burnside is the only competent man in
the expedition; and, from the personal respect and friendship i feel
for him, I trust he is not going to be made the scapegoat of the
apathy, supineness and incompetency of others. The Commodore whose
duty it should have been to attend to everything connected with the
sea transport of the troops, has shown himself but twice in the
quarter gallery of his ship, and each time with his hands thrust
deeply into his pockets, gazing listlessly at ships running ashore or
drifting into each other. General Burnside, on the contrary, has
performed all the duties of a harbour-master, narrowly escaping being
swamped on more than one occasion. Whenever a ship has been in
distress the general has been the first man off to her assistance; and
there is not a grade in his army that he has not filled during the
last fortnight, so anxious is he for the well being and comfort of his troops.</p>

<p>To-day is fine,  more steamers are working over the bulkhead;

in all probability the first brigade, escorted by the gun-boats, will
be on its way to Roanoke tonight. The General changes his quarters
this afternoon to the Spalding, and I go with him. In a day or two, I presume, there will have been many heads broken; for, if we can believe the contrabands who make their way here hourly preparations have been made to give us a warm reception. They tell us the Confederates have a dozen gun-boats and some powerful shore batteries mounted with l00-pounders. In our expedition there cannot be less than seventy or eighty guns afloat; and so I suppose when the entertainment commences there will be lots of noise made.

This letter leaves by a bearer of despatches, who has promised to mail it for me in Washington. My next will probably contain the account of a victory or a defeat, ould nothing in the shape of shot

or shell interfere with my pen or pencil.</p>

<p>The Africa brings New York journals of the 12th ult. The general tenor of the advices is again favourable to the Federals. The steady perseverance and more lasting qualities of the North have already nearly cleared Kentucky of the Secessionists, carried the war into Western Tennessee, and seized on two more points on the coast of North Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>News has been received from the Burnside expedition to the coast

of North Carolina. . The telegrams are very<orig reg="meager"> meagre </orig,>but we gather from them that on the 5th ult. General Burnside sailed from Hatteras Inlet for Roanoke Island, which lies between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. This island had been carefully fortified by the Confederates, and they had had warning of the point of attack. The island was captured after three days' fighting. The loss was heavy on both sides. The Confederate flotilla of gun-boats was dispersed; three were sunk and two captured. On the 9th ult., the expedition attacked Elizabeth City, which the inhabitants evacuated. It was completely burnt, but whether by the inhabitants or the shells from the Federal fleet is not known. The Federals had occupied the site of the burnt city, and were advancing on Edentown. These two towns are situated on the north of Albemarle Sound.</p>

<p>In Tennessee, Fort Donnelson has not yet been attacked. The Memphis and Ohio Railroad bridge fifteen miles above Fort Henry, has been taken possession of by the federal troops. This cuts off the connection between Memphis and Nashville. Federal gun-boats have ascended the Tennessee River as high as Florence, Alabama, and encountered, no opposition. General Smith on the west, and General Grant on the east of that river were pursuing the retreating Confederates. - The report that the gravity of the circumstances had

 drawn General Beauregard from Manassas to Nashville, leaving General Johnstone in command at the former position, has been confirmed.</p>

<p>General Thomas, in command of the Federal forces in southeastern Kentucky, had advanced no farther south than Monticello, the state of the roads hindering a more speedy progress. From the papers found in the deserted camp of the Confederates, on the Cumberland, it is evident by the admission of their own military and civil leaders that in Eastern Tennessee[sic] the mass of the people are loyal to the Union, and wait with impatience the arrival of the Union armies.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The term of the twelve months' volunteers from the Gulf States is

now expiring, and in many of the best regiments a large majority

decline to re-enlist for the war.</p>

<p>The Confederate Government had declined to admit Commissioners Fish and Ames into the Southern States.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARREST OF GENERAL STONE.</p>

<p>This General, till lately in command of the army of the Upper

Potomac, was arrested at Washington on the 9th, and sent to Fort Lafayette on the following serious charges:-</p>

<p> 1. For misbehaviour at the battle of Ball's Bluff.</p>

<p>2. For holding correspondence with the enemy before and since the battle of

Ball's Bluff, and receiving visits from rebel officers in his camp.</p>

<p> 3. For treacherously suffering the enemy to build a fort, or strong work, since the battle of Ball's Bluff, under his guns, without molestation.</p>

<p>4. For a treacherous design to expose his force to capture and destruction

by the enemy under pretence of orders for a movement from the
Commanding General which had not been given.</p>

<p>The news of this arrest caused the greatest consternation among

the officers of the regular army, to which General Stone belonged.</p>

<p rend="center"> THE ADMINISTRATION.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Cameron, the late Secretary for War, on the occasion of his retirement, has been published. The correspondence is of a highly friendly and even affectionate character, and is dated Jan, 11. Mr. Lincoln speaks of the Czar of Russia as the" great Sovereign whose personal and hereditary friendshp for the United States so much endears him to Americans."</p>

<p>The correspondence between Secretary Seward and Mr. Dayton,

United States' Minister to Paris, concerning the admission of American
citizens to the Tuileries has been published. Mr. Seward thinks that
Mr. Dayton ought to furnish the profession or occupation of the
applicants but not their "social position," as distinctions of social
position are unknown in America. The letter concludes in a highly patriotic strain:-</p>

<p><q rend="blockquote"> "It is peculiarly uncomfortable, at the present moment, to find American citizens leaving their country a prey to faction and civil war, disturbing the court of a friendly Power, and embarrassing our representative there with questions of personal interest and pretension. Let the Emperor and

Empress of France receive when they will, and as many or few as they
will, and let all others, as well as those who are admitted turn their
attention to the question how they can serve their country abroad;
and, if they can find no better way to do it than by making their
attendance in the saloons of the Tuileries, let them return home to a
"country that now, for the first time, and not for a long time, needs
the active efforts of every one of its loyal children to save itself from destruction. Finally, above all things, have no question with the Government of Fiance on this subject. Rather introduce nobody, however justly distinguished, then let a question of fashion or ceremony appear in the records of the important period in which we are acting for the highest interests of our country and of humanity."</q></p>
<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The House Treasury Note Bill is now before the Senate's Finance Committee. Among the amendments proposed is one making it obligatory to pay the interest of the national debt in coin. In the meantime a bill authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue 10,000,000 dols. In Treasury notes has been hurried through both Houses.

Mr. Sumner offered a series of resolutions declaring that the revolted

States have committed felo de se, and that their relations as members of the United States no longer exist; that their allegiance has been severed, and the Federal Government owes no obligation to any pre-tended State Government usurping a certain territory; that individuals occupying such territory owe allegiance to the General Government only, and the General Government to the individuals; there fore, persona heretofore held as slaves under local laws, now of no effect, may look henceforth to the General Government for protection as individuals.

<p>The arms of the Federal Government have achieved a valuable success in the capture of the isle of Roanoke. The destruction of the weak fleet of the Confederates is a small matter, but the opening up the way for General Burnside to attack in rear the army, which it was not thought advisable to assail in front, is an operation that makes a mark in the campaign. The country into which General Burnside has to penetrate, if he is to assume the offensive, is very difficult, but there is reason to believe that its difficulties have been exaggerated. At all events, he has established a base of operations. The plan of General MClellan would appear to be a scheme for sundering the Confederate forces as much as possible, instead of attempting<lb/>
to overwhelm them in little; and if the perseveres in such tactics,
and the money of the North hold out, he may have the honour of
achieving a comparatively bloodless triumph. The officers of the South
have larned the trade of war, and know better than to refuse to
surrender untenable postions. In the meantime, the civilians are
warring in Congress, and Mr. Charles Sumner has laid before it his
bold propsal for dealing with the South. He wishes to declare all
local government in the Slave States as at an end, to reduce those
States to the condition of territories, and thereby to place the whole
population, inluding the four millions of slaves, on an equality of
civil rights. It can hardly be supposed that Congress will think that
matters are sufficiently forward for the adoption of this plan, which
could be justified only when the North should be in force sufficient
to prevent the servile war that would be invited by such a
proclamation; but that such a proposition should be brought forward at
all shows the increasing power and courage of the Abolitionists. In
London the birthday of Washington has been celebrated by American
residents and visitors, but the demonstration has been confined to the
Loyalists, and the most friendly sentiments towards England were
enunciated.</p>
<p>It is stated that the Captain of the Sumter has been arrested at
the instance of the Captain of the Tuscarora, but we don't learn, as
yet, whether the former is to be handed over to the latter; if so,
there will be "a short shrift."</p></div2>

<p>A<hi rend="smallcaps">MERICAN POSSESSION OF SAN
JUAN.</hi>--Mr. H<hi rend="smallcaps">ALLIBURTON</hi> asked the
Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs various questions regarding the
possession of a portion of San Juan by the Americans.-- Lord P<hi
rend="smallcaps">ALMERSTON</hi> said the occupation of a portion of San Juan by the Americans took place under

an arrangement made in 1859 between General Scott, representing the
American Government, and Colonel Douglas, the then Governor of the
island. The main conditions were, without prejudice to the claim of
either party to the whole of the island, that the occupation should be
a joint one. The negotiations which had been going on between the two
Governments with a view to a final settlement of the question of
occupation, and of the claims over the<orig reg="neighboring"> neighbouring</orig> channel, were
suddenly interrupted by the breaking out of the civil war. Under the
circumstances of the case he did not think it necessary to enter into
any details.</p></div2>

<p>The<hi rend="italic"> Philadelphia Enquirer</hi> of Jan, 28 gives the following amusing

account of a lev&#x00e9;e held by_the new Federal Secretary of War, Mr.

Stanton:--

The clock strikes ten, the awaiting crowd rush in as the doors swing
open, and, being among them, we soon find ourselves in the presence of
the Secretary. Now one stands in front of him, and with a smiling-
countenance he reaches out his hand, and, takes a hearty grip with a
greyhaired man. "Well, Sir, what is your wish?" "My name is -; my son
fought at Springfield, and was wounded in the arm. He was on Fremont's
staff, but is now without a commission. I want one for him, that he
may again try his other arm here on the Potomac or in Missouri." "You shall have it, Sir," replied Mr. Stanton, and, turning to his secretary, he ordered him to note the case. "Return home," he added; "the papers will be sent you."</p>

<p>As the man attempted to thank him, he stepped to one side to two ladies

who had just come in. "Madam, what can I do for you?" "Want a clerk

ship for my son; his father was killed at the battle of Belmont." Turning

again, be noted the case, took the address, told the lady to send him a sample

of her boy's writing, and he would care for him. The other was connected

with a Minnesota regiment over the river, and had some complaint about the treatment she had received in camp from some of the officers. "Madam, you must go to the head-quarters of General M'Clellan." "I have been there, Sir, and they would not read my papers, or listen to my case." "Then give them to

me, and I'll see why."</p>

<p>A small bright-eyed boy, alone, was trying to work his way through the crowd, and the Secretary turned to him and asked what he wanted. "I want my father got out, Sir. He was taken at Bull Bun, and has not come home with the rest," He gave his name and regiment; it was noted; and the Secretary, lifting him up, kissed him upon the forehead, and said, " Your father should be proud of such a noble boy, and I'll see that he is released."</p>

<p>A man with a half-military dress says he has been wronged by the examining board, and has been deprived of the command of his regiment (a Philadelphia cavalry regiment). "Sorry, Sir, if it is not all right. I cannot go back to investigate the acts of my predecessor." The Colonel insisted his case was a plain one, if he could be heard. "Well," said the Secretary, "If you will get the officers to reconsider it I will then listen to it."</p>

<p>An individual has some new invention for firearms. "Go to the Ordnance

Department and get them to investigate it, and if they will recommend
it I will be glad to see it adopted." A Colonel with a green uniform
on has some passes he wants to read. "Are you an army officer?" "Yes,
Sir." "Then you cannot be heard until to-morrow; come and see me then."</p>

<p>A large and well-dressed man wanted a word in private. "What about?" Some little matter about a contract he had for horses. "Cannot interfere, Sir; go to General Meigs. If there is anything wrong he will rectify it." Another succeeds in getting him off to the side of the room, and the conversation is inaudible until the Secretary replied, "No, Sir, on no account will I interfere in any contract while I am here for anything from a thimble up. There are men appointed to attend to that department, and I shall hold them to a strict accountability for every action."</p>

<p>Two soldiers wanted to be paid for the time they were in confinement at Richmond, having just been released, and presented a furlough they had received a week ago, and also an order for their pay for time and rations. "Why do you not take this to Major Beckwith, and have him attend to it?" "We did, Sir; and he says he has no order that will cover our case, and for want of 'forms' we are afraid we will be kept hero until our time is up, and we want to go home and see the folks before going at it again." Turning to

his secretary, he ordered him to write to Major Beckwith, and order him to report forthwith in 'writing why these men were not paid up, instead of being kept waiting. It was done; he signed it himself, and said,"Here, take that to him, and bring an answer."</p>

<p>After some other visitors are described, the account goes on:</p>

<p>In came Major Beckwith, with the note sent by the returned prisoners

"Why are them men kept waiting?" "Because I have no order for their special case." "Mr.Wilson, issue an order that will cover all the prisoners that may be released in future, and allow them full pay for every day they are confined in rebel prisons. Major, I have just learnt there are over 150 now waiting for their pay; every man most be paid to-day, and speed them on to their homes."</p>

<p>A tall men wants a commission in the regular army. "Have you been in

any battle yet, Sir?" "I was in the Mexican War." "That won't do; that

is too far back." "I was at Great Bethel." "That is better. I will examine

your record myself, and inform you if you are appointed."</p>

<p>A stout, healthy young man wanted a oommission or clerkship. "Have you

been in any battle?" "No, Sir." "Then it will be of no use to apply, for I shall make all my appointments from the list of heroes; those who fight the country's battles must be cared for first."</p>

<p>Another wanted an appointment as quartermaster. "There are my recom

mendations, Sir, and I would be glad if you can read, them." "I cannot

do it now, I have not the time; but I will examine them." "Very well," replied

the would-be-quartermaster; "just read them. If you have any better man,

according to those papers, let him have the office; to that case I
don't want it."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">On Ward the Spalding, Pamlico Sound,</p>
<p rend="right"> North Carolina, Jan. 29,</p>

<p>A<hi rend="italic">T</hi> last, after immense exertion on the part of those concerned, General

Burnside especially having worked night and day, sufficient transports

have been got over the bulkhead to carry 11,000 men up the Sound,

end it is now a mere question of reshipping the troops that were landed to lighten the vessels and to provision them for ten days. It appears to me there must have been gross stupidity or cupidity displayed by those authorised to purchase the steamers for the service they are now engaged in, as their draught of water, in nine cases out of ten, exceeds by a great deal the depth found on the various banks and shoals that block the entrance to the inland seas of North Carolina; hence the delay of the expedition. Before we could continue up the Sound to Roanoke all the larger vessels had to laud their troops and provisions, otherwise they never could have crossed the bulkhead; and, as it is, they have been worried through the sand, inch by inch, a distance of over three miles, many taking four and five days to force their[sic] way through. Again, the channel is so narrow that it is impossible[sic] for more than one ship at a time to attempt the passage; and, should one stick, she has to be removed before another can be brought up. The two last are now on their way over, but, unfortunately, the leading vessel has grounded, and may cause a further delay of a day or two; however, the general opinion appears to be that we shall get off by the and of the week, and, when once fairly, started, it only takes ten hours to reach Roanoke. Now, had steamers of lighter draught been provided, nothing would have

 prevented the expedition from steaming up the Sound on the

first day of our arrival and striking a decisive blow before preparations could he made by the Confederates to offer effectual resistance, as it is extremely probable they were in ignorance of the destination of the Federal fleet. By this time they will have learned through their spies everything required to be known (two Secesh gunboats came within sight the other day and reconnoitred), and prepare accordingly a warm reception for the invading force.</p>

<p>As I understand the plan of attack it is as follows :-The gun-boats

will take the lead up the Sound, followed by the larger transports

having the troops on board, and the rear will be brought up by the
store-ships in tow of tugs. On arriving off the southern extremity of
Roanoke Island, the former will engage the batteries, which are said
to be immensely strong there, while the troops under the cover of
their fire will be transferred to scows and surf-boats, and, passing
over the shallows on the western side, land, and take the Confederates
in the rear, cutting off their retreat in the event of their being
beaten. Now, there is just a possibility of the Southern fleet showing
fight; they have fourteen gun-boats heavily armed with gnus of large
calibre, taken from the Norfolk Navy -yard ; and, if they do, they may
cause the Federalists great annoyance in going up the Sound. A few
shells thrown among the transports, crowded as they are with troops,
would create a considerable amount of confusion, and, as I happen to
be on board the leading ship, the General's, I most fervently hope
they will do nothing of the kind. As it is, I presume we shall get
awfully pounded on drawing within range of the batteries. Well, supposing Roanoke to be taken, the expedition will then proceed to New Berne, seizing the railway at that place, and, advancing inland to Goldsboro, occupy all the converging lines there with ultimate intentions on Raleigh; thus, as I said in my previous letter, cutting off all communication with the more Southern States, and leaving the Confederate army at Manassas helpless as regards reinforcements or supplies from any State south of Virginia. In Kentucky the Unionists are pushing forward to assist end support the movements of this expedition, the idea being that the two forces should form a junction, and so entirely shut out Beauregard's army from the rest of Secessia; then, I presume M'Clellan would advance with the main body of Federalists, and fight the decisive battle so long expected.</p>

<p>The last news we have here tells us that Sherman is about to move
on Savannah from Port Royal, that Butler is preparing to menace New
Orleans from Ship Island, and that the huge expedition down the
Mississippi has started, or is at the point of starting. So that
another month may bring you tidings of the last of the Confederate
States' Government, or such intelligence as will probably cause its
recognition by the European Powers, the latter in the event of the
failure of the Federal plans. Mind, I don't mean to prophesy any
success for the Unionists; I simply mention the programme apparently
to be followed. Again, as far as this expedition is concerned, I  have
certain doubts of its achieving all required of it, as I cannot shut
my eyes to the glaring incapacity of those whose business it is to
second the General in command. If everything depended on the exertions
of one man-I speak of General Burnside-I am convinced my task would be
to record a victory; as ,it is, I must wait the issue of the fight.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the Cunard -steamer America we have telegrams
from Halifax to the 21st ult., Boston journals to the 19th ult,, and New York journals of the day previous. The Federals have obtained such a decided military success as to afford ground for the belief that the Confederate Government will be shortlived.</p>

<p rend="center"> T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE SURRENDER OF FORT DONNELSON.</hi></p>

<p>Fort Donnelson, on the Cumberland River, was invested on the 13th,

and after three days' hard fighting, was surrendered unconditionally.

The land forces of the Federals numbered 40,000 men, under the command of General Grant. Commodore Foote brought up six gun-boats

(four of them iron-plated) to the attack on the river side. From the
moment of the investment of the fort the Federal troops lay on their
arms night and day, half the time without provisions, all the time
without tents, and a portion in a heavy storm of rain and snow. The
gun-boat attack was unsuccessful, Commodore Foote acknowledging that
four of his boats were disabled, and forty one of his men lulled and wounded. The total loss of the Federals on land and water is at least 300 killed and 700 wounded and missing. The loss of officers is very heavy. The Confederate loss of life is less heavy, as they fought behind intrenchments. They are, however, minus an army and some of their best Generals. Fifteen thousand men capitulated including Generals Sydney Johnston (who shared with Beauregard the honours of Bull Run), Buckner, and Bushrod. General Floyd escaped with 5000 men during the night preceding the surrender. He and his force went up the river on board some steamers 'without the knowledge of their superior officers. The Confederates lost, besides forty-eight field-pieces, seven heavy guns, twenty thousand stand arms, and a large quantity of commissary stores. On the morning of the surrender the Federal troops were about to storm the fort with the bayonet.</p>

<p> The news of this great success was received with great rejoicing in

Congress, among the army of the Potomac and generally throughout the Country. Congress passed resolutions thanking the army and navy. How it has aected the people of the Seceding States we do not yet know, but the impression is general that the resistance to the victorious armies of the Union will soon cease. General Grant has been promoted to the rank of Major-General.</p>

<p>Commodore Foote is already pressing onto Clarksville, about twenty

miles above Fort Donnelson. The Confederates have already evacuated

Clarksville. They will make their next stand in defence of the important manufacturing city of Nashville. General Beauregard has fallen back on this city from Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Federal army, commanded by General Mitchell, is close on his rear.</p>

<p rend="center">.THE CAMPAIGN IN ARKANSAS.</p>

<p>General Price, beaten out of Missouri, is being pursued by the

Federals through Arkansas. Much of his baggage, several officers,

and a considerable number of privates belonging to the rear of his army, have been captured.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>The official account of the exploits of this expedition have
appeared. General Burnside announces that he captured on Roanoke
Island six forts, forty guns, 2500 prisoners, and upwards of 3000
small arms. The Federal loss was thirty-five killed and about 200
wounded. Commodore Goldsborough occupied Edenton on the 12th, without opposition. In view of these reverses, Governor Letcher, of Virginia, has issued a proclamation stating that recent reverses "demand an exhibition of all our energies, an uncompromising spirit, and stern and determined resolution." He recommends a lev&#x00e9;e en masse of the whole of the male population between the ages of sixteen and sixty.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill making Treasury

notes a legal tender, with the Senate's amendment making the interest on the National Debt payable in coin.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish and Bishop Ames have agreed with the Confederate Government on an exchange of prisoners. At the time when the negotiation was concluded the Confederates held 300 prisoners more than the number held by the Federals.</p>

<p>The War Department has issued an order directing the release of all
political prisoners, except spies, on their subscribing a parole
engaging them to render no aid to the enemies of the United States. To
all such persons who shall keep their parole the President has granted
an amnesty for any past offences of treason or
disloyalty. Extraordinary arrests will henceforth be made under the
direction of the military authorities alone.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS</p>.

<p>The New York and Philadelphia journals preserve an entire silence on
the subject of Earl Russell's closing despatch on the Trent
affair. This is a sign that it commands the respect if not the
acquiescence of the journalists, and that they prefer to leave the
consideration of the points involved to the Secretary of State and the
jurists of the country. Elated, however, by the recent victories, they
begin to carp at the Mexican expedition, and to warn the Allies that
the American people will not permit the restoration of a European
monarchy on their southern border. The Boston Advertiser devotes a column to the discussion of Earl Russell's despatch, the positions of

which meet with its approval as enlarging the rights of neutrals.

Considerable popular excitement exists in New York concerning the

approaching execution of Captain Gordon, the slavetrader. Numerous

petitions have been forwarded to Washington to commute the sentence.

Public sympathy runs high in favour of the condemned.

Professor Agassiz is delivering a series of popular lectures on

natural history in Irving Hall, New York.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The last accounts from California state that an extraordinary

emigration to the goldfields of British Columbia is expected to take

place this spring. One steamer had just sailed from San Francisco

with 600 passengers for that destination.</p></div2>

<p>A decisive and important victory gained by the Federals has
naturally thrown the Northern States into great excitement. About this
action there can be no mistake, and there is no need for
exaggeration. Fort Donnelson has fallen after three days of hard
fighting and very considerable slaughter on both sides. Three
Confederate Generals are prisoners, with, it is said, 15,000 men; and
General Floyd, with 5000 men, saved himself by a flight which is not considered
"chivalrous."<lb/> Right and left, therefore, the forces of the

Union are clearing their way, and their operations may speedily

induce General M'Clellan to advance. It would appear that no time was to be lost, the victors in Tennessee were pushing onwards, and, though the character of the country rendered a check possible at any moment, it was not thought that they

 would meet serious opposition for some time to come. It is

also reported that Savannah has fallen, and there is no improbability
in the news. At length, therefore, the North may fairly be said to be
putting out its strength in earnest and delivering the effective blows
which might have been expected from the magnitude of its
preparations. The Secretary at War has availed himself of these
successes to rebuke in a

stern Puritan tone the language in which various American

writers have sought to imitate the Napoleonic bombast, which, as he says, began in "infidel France," and led the French up

Waterloo. There is no "organisation of victories," he says, the
triumph being due to the spirit of the Lord putting valour into the
soldiery of the North. But there is too much love for fine writing and
grandiloquence in America to make the stern Secretary's reproof very
effectual. We do not suppose that:, in the present state of the
American mind, any expressions of English admiration for the gallantry of the Federals will be received with favour; but we may put on record, to be read when all ill-feeling shall have subsided, that, apart from the satisfaction felt in England at any success obtained against the advocates of slavery, we are proud of the bravery of our cousins, and are ready to recognise in the endurance which they have displayed under trying circumstances an evidence that their relationship to the conquerors in the Crimea, India, and China, is more real than many will allow, We shall, of course, be told that these sentiments are curiously coincident with the success which is said, unfairly, to be the idol of England; but we will bear that, simply remarking that we have nothing to gain by a Northern triumph, whereas we might be commercially benefited by the establishment of the South.</p></div2>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> recently-organised territory of
Nevada, North America, besides containing the beautiful Carson Valley,
has been rendered famous by being the seat of the Washoe silver
-mines, the fame of whose riches drew, it will be remembered, a year
or two ago, swarms of hardy adventurers from even the golden regions
of California to the spot. This region, running north and south, lies
between the needy para lel ranges of the Sierra Nevada on the
Californian side and the Humboldt range on the side of Utah. As the
most conflicting statements have been made respecting the Washoe
silver-mines, some holding them up to derision and others enduing them
with the halo of extravagant expectations, a few graphic sketches of
its principal mining-places will not be unwelcome to our
readers. Mr. Edward Vischer, who has forwarded to us the accompanying
illustrations,with many others is a merchant, of San Francisco,
California, in which State he has lived many years. Practically
acquainted with mining pursuits, and not being personally interested
in Washoe or in mining operations of any kind, his views of the silver
region in Nevada, herewith given, may be taken as trustworthy :-" The
early feverish speculative excitement with regard to the Washoe
region, which as an inheritance of 1859 passed undiminished to its
successor, threatening California with a new mania of emigration like
that of the memorable Fraser River, has been checked just in time to
prevent more serious mischief and the ruin of many of our business
men. This was but the disappointment corresponding to silly
exaggeration the whole region east of the Sierra Nevada being fancied  a ready-made new

Potosi without the trouble of even opening a mine. It was, however, suddenly brought to a climax by the outbreak of hostilities with the Indians, which could only be terminated by military aid. Thus the new mining region, hitherto decked out with the fanciful radiance of the wildest imagination, was all at once reduced to the reality of mining in a remote wilderness; and it was then discovered that mining for silver, here as anywhere else, requires time and capital for the development of its returns. However, should the mines hitherto opened be the only ones, even precluding the hope of a further exten-

 sion of the promising field for mining, their successful working
 would be of incalculable benefit for California, which for a long
 while will have to furnish all the supply of necessaries and look to
 the opening of a rear country as the only true lever by which she may
 ultimately obtain a Pacific railroad. As to the realities of the new
 silver region, we wonder so little should be known about them; a
 quarter of a century will be a more appropriate term, when the
 millions of Washoe silver feeding the channels of an enlarged Asiatic
 trade may (by a reversing scale, telling of our advancement), bear a
 comparison with our lessened gold remittances vi&#x00e2; Panama to
 Europe." After enumerating the principal leads, the produce of the
 mines already opened, and the reducing-works established or in course
 of erection, he alludes to visionary speculation in Washoe mining
 works, "This," he continues, "Is the fictitious side of Washoe mining-the vapoury atmosphere which surrounds the new silver region. Its mirages no longer delude the thinking portion of our community, it is fortunate, indeed, that our public has at so early a stage had a salutary warning by previous disenchantment. In the meanwhile, the energetic spirit of practical enterprise, by a combination of technical and, financial resources, is gradually but steadily developing the colossal wealth of the new silver region, the discovery of which is the fruit of the adventurous turn of our prospectors, who, with almost superhuman exertions, and mostly with little benefit to themselves, have been the hardy pioneers of this new Potosi beyond the Sierra Nevada."</p>

<p>Mr. Vischer has since had the opportunity, by a visit to the Washoe

region, in May of last year, for the sake of personal information, to

confirm him in his opinion that the time has not arrived for justly estimating the financial importance of the discoveries in Western Utah, albeit their development, even thus far, has proved a main lever for the progress of California, whence most of the necessities of the new silver region have to be supplied. It has, moreover, established the claim of that region beyond the Sierra Nevada (now known as "Nevada Territory," since its separation from Utah and Mormon influences) to the birth of a new and promising community
in barren wastes apparently unfit for cultivation and the sub-sistence of & permanent population, the outposts of which, however,

by the progress of prospecting and actual mining enterprise, already extend to the Humboldt range of mountains, bordering on the Great Basin, with every probability of soon connecting the Washoe region with Salt lake through a continued line of settlements; the telegraph and overland mail stations, with the increasing traffic of Western

emigration serving as preparatory links of this phenomenon in the progress of civilisation.

Subsequently, in a quite recent visit to Washoe, the writer witnessed the extraordinary start which has taken place within the last few months, with many cases of individual success; the gradual development of many a new mining district, and the improved methods introduced, with works on a gigantic scale multiplying the chances for a
yield in precious metals, which cannot fail to assert its weight in the

financial scales of the world.</p>

<p>But we return to our immediate object, that of giving some particulars  relating to the Illustrations now presented to our readers.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ENGRAVINGS</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Devil's Gate</hi>, some three miles up the
Gulch of Gold Cannon, is a remarkable cluster of rocks on each side, forming a natural gateway and appropriate entrance to this demoniac region. To the south of it extending about half a mile down the Gulch, lies Silver City, with a population of some two thousand inhabitants; a place teeming with the activity of the entire traffic from California to Washoe.

Numerous teams are constantly occupied an the transportation of ore

from the mines to the crushing-mills (two of the principal of which

are represented in our Engraving; and the noise of some 500 stampers

and snorting of steam-engines render it a fit abode for the Cyclops.

The summit of the rock, forming the right side of the gate, at the time

of the late Indian troubles, was used as a fortification against the

Pah-Utes.</p>

</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Gold-hill,Mount Davidson, and the
Ophir-road.</hi>--Following the ascent of the Cannon for about two and
a half miles beyond the Devil's Gate northerly, we arrive at the
famous Gold-hill, the paying-place, par excellence, of the Washoe
region, as the produce of its mines, less remarkable for its positive
richness than the continuity of a steady average yield of from 50 to
75 dols., to the ton, chiefly in gold of easy extraction, enters into
immediate circulation. Its bountiful yield of such ore is practically
evinced by the uninterrupted line of heavy teams carrying the precious
rock to the mills of Silver City and on Carson River, the works
established in the vicinity of Gold-hill being insufficient even for
the requirements of the companies which erected and work them for ther
own use. The alloy of silver, hitherto disregarded, is increasing at a
rate which will imply a more complicated process, and retard the
result. This hill, perforated by numerous tunnels, with its stir of
life, resembles a vast beehive; and the airy scaffolding of the
schuyts for delivering the rock surround it as with the tracery of
some huge spider's web. The entire frontage of Gold-hill proper does
not exceed 250 yards, this space being subdivided into numerous claims
of from 5ft. to lOft, each, worked by a few men. Individual mining,
therefore, is the prevailing feature in this locality; and the
consequence is a certain recklessness in pushing into the pay-ing
ledge as fast as possible, with a frequent disregard of the safety of
support among tunnels in danger of "caving in."</p>

<p>The pressure of the immense force organised by the Federal

Government of America begins at length to tell upon the

Southern Confederacy. Several minor successes in the south-west have
culminated in the capture of Fort Donnelson, with nearly its whole
garrison, armament, ammunition, and stores. General Floyd, it is true,
with 5000 men, escaped during the night preceding the surrender,
otherwise the victory was complete. The Confederates have abandoned
the important strategical position which they held at Bowling
Green. Nashville, the seat of the Southern Government, appeared by the last advices received before writing the remarks which follow to be in imminent danger. Possibly, news of its having fallen into the possession of the Northern troops may reach this country before the issue of the present Number of our Journal, and, whenever it does the relation of the Border States to the great struggle between the North and the South will have been virtually determined. Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri will have been recovered for
 the Union. The army which has so long covered Manassas

Gap will be exposed to be taken in the rear and must retire.

General M'Clellan will be able to clear Virginia, and Secession<lb/>

will be shut up in the Gulf States, the Slave States proper, to fight for endurable terms of submission, or to hold out to the last for independence.</p>

<p>From the day when the boom of the first cannon fired in this

war swept over the surface of the Charleston waters, the part to be
taken in it by the four great Border States was looked for by both
parties with intense anxiety. In each of them the interests and
opinions of the population were known to be divided bethveen North and
South; and probably each, could it have resisted external influence,
would have preferred to occupy a neutral position, and, by interposing
between the extreme parties on both sides, to have ultimately effected
a reconciliation. Secessionists, however, at the outbreak of the civil war, held in their hands in all the States the machinery of government, both legislative and executive, and, by a prompt, energetic, and lawless use of the means at their command, succeeded in tearing them away from the Union, and placing much of their real and more of their apparent strength at the disposal of President Davis. The moral effect of this successful stratagem, especially upon the people and armies of the South, has, no doubt, been prodigious. But it was far easier to suppress for a<lb/>

period all show of sentiment in favour of the Union than to annihilate it. It has already asserted its right to be heard. Invarious places it has snatched up the weapons readiest to its hand, and done battle, in a sort of guerrilla fashion, with the usurpation, that would have crushed it out of existence. Assuming that General Halleck will complete the work he has so successfully commenced, he will liberate from the forced pressure put upon it by the Secessionists the whole amount of loyal sentiment diffused through the Border States, and, from being held in abeyance, it will become dominant. To all present intents and purposes the triumph of his arms will immediately restore Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri to the Union, and will thereby render Virginia untenable much longer by the Confederates.</p>

<p>The Southern army, which occupies so strong a position at Manassas,
and which has hitherto kept General M'Clellan and the army of the
Potomac at bay, can be safe where it is only so long as it has free
communication with the country behind it. A command of the railroads
which traverse that vast area, and by which its supplies and
reinforcements have hitherto been forwarded, is absolutely essential
to it. The importance,<pb n="264"/>
therefore, of holding the several centres where these railroads
converge on their way to the north-east was seen at an, early period
of the struggle, and wherever they have been menaced they have been
guarded by strong bodies of Con-federate troops. It is this
circumstance which invests the capture of Fort Donnelson with so much
interest. It constituted: a base for that division of the Southern
army the main business of which was to keep open the communications which connected the army in Virginia with every part of the seceded States. But, should the expedition which has recently seized Edenton,Elizabeth city, and Hertford gain possession of the line between Charleston and Savannah, and General Halleck, as seems most probable, obtain command over the junctions at Bowling Green and Nashville, President Davis or General Beauregard, or whoever presides over the military force in Virginia, will probably find it necessary, unless he would run the risk of being starved out or hemmed in, to beat a retreat from Manassas, and leave the Northern Generals, including M'Clellsn, to close round the Gulf States, and stamp out, meanwhile, the embers of civil war in the great Border States. Should they effect thus much -before the close of the spring season, they will have done all that can be reasonably expected of them, and the question at -issue between the two parties will be immensely narrowed.</p>

<p>Such a consummation will put the North into a fair position to consider whether an indefinite prolongation of the contest, with a view to subjugate the Slave -States, will be worth the immense suffering and expense which, in the event of their refusing to give up their independence, the attempt to force it from them will inevitably entail. The recovery of the

Border States will enable the Government at Washington to put an end to the war on terms at once honourable and advantageous-terms, moreover, which would relieve it from the responsibility of dealing with the difficult question of slavery. But we fear that this termination of the struggle is not to be hoped for, at least for the present. Possibly, too, it is only our ignorance of the real temper of the South -which permits us to wish for it. It may turn out, after all, that Secession has been -mainly the work of ambitious and disappointed politicians, whose objects, in the hour of misfortune, the majority of the population, even in the Slave States, will decline to further to the ruin of all their material interests and prospects. At any rate, whether the Confederacy shall once more be merged in the Union, or shall succeed in establishing, an independent Republic,one thing seems tolerably clear, and in this we rejoice, that the roots of the slave system will have

been cut up for ever.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Canard steamer Asia we have news from New

York to the afternoon of the 26th ult. The movements of the Federal,

forces on the Cumberland River continue to form the most important

feature of the week's news.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OCCUPATION OF NASHVILLE</p>

<p>Clarksville was occupied on the 20th by the Federal forces. Two-thirds of the inhabitants fled. Commodore Foote issued a proclamation assuring all peaceably-disposed persons that they might resume their usual occupations, provided that they gave up all military stores and equipments in their possession.</p>

<p>Pushing forward, the Federal troops on the 24th occupied Nashville,

the capital of Tennessee and one of the most important manufacturing

cities of the Confederate States. General Bueell entered the city
with-out resistance at the head of 10,000 troops and hoisted the stars
and stripes over the State House. The Confederates, under General
Beauregard, had retired to Murfreesboro', an inland place about thirty miles south of Nashville, where the Federals will not have the advantage of their gun-boats. The Tennessee Legislature had adjourned to Memphis.</p>

<p rend="center">LOSSES AT FORT DONNELSON.</p>

<p>The official returns show 321 killed, 1050 wounded, and 150 missing

on the Federal side. The prisoners taken by them number, not 15,000, but 3,300. They have been taken to Chicago and St. Louis.</p>

<p rend="center">OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND ARKANSAS.</p>

<p>In Eastern Kentucky the Federals have occupied Cumberland Gap.

In Arkansas General Price was defeated at Sugar Creek, and fled,

leaving many prisoners and arms in the hands of the victors. General
Halleck has issued an order forbidding the stealing or concealing'
fugitive slaves, assigning as a reason the urgent necessity of proving
to the Southern people that the Federals are fighting for the constitution and the Union, and not for emancipation.</p>

<p rend="center">OPERATIONS ON THE SEACOAST.</p>

<p>Burnside's expedition has burnt Winton, on the Chowau River. No
landing was effected, on account of the presence of a large Confederate force.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The Confederate Congress assembled at Richmond on the 18th ult.

On the following day the electoral votes of the eleven States which

voted for President and Vice-President were counted. The total number

was 109, and they were all given for Mr. Davis as President and Mr.

Stephens as Vice-President. The inauguration ceremonies took place,

at Richmond on the 22nd ult., Washington's birthday. Mr. Davisthen
delivered his inaugural address. He complains of" the malignity and
barbarity of the Northern States in the prosecution of the existing
war." While, he says, every guarantee of personal freedom has been
swept away in the North, in the Confederate States no act has been
done to impair personal liberty or the freedom of speech, of thought,
or of the press. He acknowledges that the "tide for the moment is
against us, but the final result in our favour is not doubtful." He
thinks the North "must sink under the immense load of debt which they
have<pb n="265"/>
incurred." Alter lauding the noble spirit of patriotism which animates
men, women, and children in the South, he predicts the sacrifices it
imposes will be an enduring bond, of harmony among the people. The
blockade is making them a self-supporting people.

"After a series of successes and victories which covered our arms with glory, we have recently met with serious disasters. But in the heart of a people resolved to be free these disasters tend but to stimulate to increased resistance." He concludes with a solemn invocation of the Deity.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis had appointed the 28th ult, as a day of fasting, humilia

tion, and prayer throughout the Confederate States.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The youngest son of the President, aged eleven years, has died at

the White House.</p>

<p>The President has signed the Treasury Note Bill. In its final shape it provided for the payment in coin of the interest on the public debt, and as security therefore stipulated that the customs duties should be payable in specie only.</p>

<p>The President has taken military possession of all the telegraph

lines, and military supervisors of messages have been appointed.</p>

<p>The Senate, by a vote of 29 to 9, has thrown out the State Department's project of a treaty for guaranteeing the payment of the Mexican debt for five years. General Scott's name was submitted as Commissioner to Mexico to procure the ratification of this now defeated project of a treaty.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANOUS</p>

<p>Washington's birthday (Feb. 22) was celebrated with more than

ordinary enthusiasm throughout the Free States. Mr. Forney read Washington's farewell address in the great hail of the House of Representatives. In New York the historian Bancroft was the orator of the day.</p>

<p>The British screw-steamer Stella had been chartered to convey American contributions to the International Exhibition.</p>

<p>The journals comment favourably on the speeches made at the open

ing of Parliament, but the Mexican expedition is more freely and

generally denounced than before, especially that part of it which includes the elevation of a European Prince to the throne of Mexico.</p>

<p>The barque Ariel had been captured off Providence on suspicion of

being intended for the slave trade.</p></div2>


<p>The condemned slave captain, Gordon, suffered the extreme penalty
of the law in New York on the 21st ult. The wretched man took
strychnine the night previous, but by copious draughts of whisky he
was kept alive until the hour of execution. The New York journals give
highly-coloured accounts of the scene. Gordon was the first person
ever hanged in the United Slates for participation in the slave
trade.</p>

<p rend="center"> BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND  LAND</p>

<p> The Montreal Company's steamer Hibernian brings news to

the 8th instant. The Government allows hardly any news of the movements of the army and navy to transpire for publication. Columbus, the last point held in Kentucky by the Confederates, has been abandoned. The Confederates carried away their stores and artillery, and burnt their barracks, but spared the town, it was immediately afterwards occupied by the Federals.

In Tennessee the Federals have advanced to Murfreesboro', from,

which the Confederates, under General Sidney Johnson, retreated to

Decatur, a town on the Tennessee River, in Northern Alabama, the report that the Confederates were surrounded at Murfreesboro' by General Buell being unfounded. It is admitted that the people of Nashville show no sympathy for the Union troops, and studiously avoid all intercourse with them. The Mayor had issued a proclamation assuring the citizens that General Buell was desirous that industry should resume its course, and urging the country people to bring in their supplies to the Federal troops, who would remunerate them for the same. The Federal malls now run to Nashville. Andrew Johnson, the loyal senator from East Tennessee, has been appointed by the President Provisional Governor of the State. He will repair to Nashville to organise a loyal State Government there.</p>

<p>The Confederates, on evacuating Mudtown, in Arkansas, poisoned

the provisions they were obliged to abandon. On entering the village

the hungry Federals ate of the same, and died to the number of forty-two officers and men.</p>

<p>General Banks's division on the Upper Potomac had crossed that, river without resistance, and the main body of the Federals had moved forward, but a heavy fall of snow has put a stop to any further advance for the present.</p>

 <p>In Western Virginia General Lander had breathed his last. He died from overexertion and the effects of 'a wound in the leg received a

Edward's Ferry. General Shields has been appointed his successor.</p>

<p>The expeditions on the coast line are heard of at two
points. General Burnside is threatening the town of Suffolk, in the
south-east corner of Virginia. The troops of the Port Royal expedition
were within seven miles of Savannah, where they are confronted by a force of Confederates. An obstruction of timber-rafts has been placed across the river to keep the Union gun-boats at bay.</p>

<p>From the blockading squadrons we have to report several items. A

British steamer, Labuan, has been taken in Mexican waters, under
circumstances likely to give rise to diplomatic correspondence. The
Labuan has been taken into New York, while her captain is on his way
to Washington to lay the case before Lord Lyons. The steamer was
loading with cotton at Metamoras, a Mexican port, and the charge made is that she was engaged in trade with the Texan port on the

opposite side of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>The Federal steamer South Carolina captured the Confederate

steamer Magnolia while attempting to run out of Mobile with a cargo of 400 bales of cotton. The engineer attempted to blow her up, but only succeeded in killing himself.</p>

<p>The steamer Nashville, after coaling at the Bermudas, has arrived

safely at Wilmington, North Carolina. She approached the blockading vessel with the Union flag flying. After passing her she raised the Confederate flag and moved towards Fort Macon. The blockading vessel having discovered the deception gave chase, following her within range of the guns of the fort, but did her no damage.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis has sent another message to Congress. He admits that

"the Government had attempted more than it had power successfully to achieve." The effort to protect the whole territory of the Confederacy, seaboard and inland, had brought on them serious disasters. After reciting the difficulties of procuring the means of defence under which the Government laboured, and the absence of a navy, he speaks of the surrender of Roanoke Island as "deeply humiliating." Of the capitulation at Fort Donnelson he says he is "not only unwilling but unable to believe that a large army of our people have surrendered without a desperate effort to cut its way through the investing forces whatever may have been their numbers." He thinks that bitter disappointments will nerve the people to still greater exertions. He blames the policy of enlistments for short terms, and says that the quotes called for from the different States will soon be ready. The numbers in the field are 400 regiments of infantry, with proportionate cavalry and artillery. The total expenditure of the Government for the year has been only 175,000,000 dols., less than one-third of the expenditure of the enemy.</p>

<p>Congress has passed a resolution recommending the military commanders to destroy all tobacco and cotton, to prevent its falling into

the enemy's hands; and another, by a unanimous vote, that the existing war be prosecuted until the enemy shall be expelled from every foot of soil within each of the Confederate States, and that no proposition of peace contemplating any other result be listened to.</p>

<p>Richmond nas been put under martial law by President Davis, and

a society of Union men, consisting chiefly of Germans, has been arrested. Gold is at 40 to 50 per cent premium.</p>

<p>The Governor of Georgia has called for 18,000 troops by the 4th of March. If not raised by that time, draughting would follow.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln has sent a message to Congress recommending that body to pass a joint resolution offering to purchase the freedom of the slaves in any State willing to emancipate on these conditions. The message does not propose any forcible interference with any Slave State, and the President thinks that only the border Slave States are likely to entertain the subject; but he thinks that if these States were detached from the other Slave States the rebellion would be at an end, as it is only buoyed up by the hope of erecting a great empire consisting of all the now Slave States. The message concludes with a vague threat :"If resistance continues, war must continue, and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may follow it. Such means as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle must and will come."</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives, on the 3rd inst. the Chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means produced the long-expected tax

bill. Its promoters estimate that it will produce 100,000,000 dols. It
includes duties on spirituous and malt liquors, tobacco and cigars,
oils, gas, paper, advertisements, soap, salt, ginger, pepper, and
leather. Flour is taxed ten cents the barrel. Railroad, steam-boat,
omnibus, and horse-railroad passengers are threatened with a

<p>THE important news has been received that President Lincoln, in his
Message to Congress, has proposed to build "a golden bridge for a
flying enemy." He recommends tht the North should offer to co-operate
with the Slave States for the gradual emancipation of the slaves by
pecuniary compensation, leaving it to each State, however, to retain
the system of slavery or not, as it may please. The President's effort
is directed to secure the Border States, which he thinks may choose to
go with the South in the event of the independence of the latter being
recognised. The proposal seems significant, as it would imply that the
President, though at present refusing to see anything but a rebellion
which the sword is to put down, may not have been able to resist the
conviction that certain portions of what was the Union will never be
recovered to it. He would, therefore, do the best he can towards
consolidating the rest. It is premature to pronounce upon the wisdom
of promulgating this plan, because such wisdom, or its absence, can
only be inferred from the effect of the announcement upon the popular
mind; but in one sense it may be permitted to Englishmen to applaud
it, inasmuch as it is another blow at the system of slavery. It is
something to have that system thus pointed out by the Chief Magistrate
of the Northern States as the<hi rend="italic"> teterrima causa</hi>
of revolt and anarchy. We hear of no response from the South; but by a
very narrow majority, 77 to 71, the Southern House of Representatives
recommend the military commanders to destroy all tobacco and cotton
rather than let either fall into the enemy's hands. The<hi
rend="italic"> Herald</hi>, the hired organ of the slaveowners, and
only Federalist under dread of long rope and short shrift, rather
approve the President's proposal, but cannot have had time to receive
final orders, The<hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> strongly approves it. We have no war news, save that the surrender of Nashville and of Columbus is certain, and that the genius of M'Clellan is again being acknowledged by his patient and sapient critics, who now see the two wings of the eagle flapping over the prey that awaits the blow of the beak-Anglic&#x00e9;, the advance of the central army. It is stated that Mr. Seward intends to announce the intention of the North to resist the establishment of a monarchy in Mexico.</p></div2>

THE FEDERAL VICTORY AT ROANOE ISLAND.

(From our Special Ards and Correspondent.)

WAaEUmTON, Feb. 28.

LT last the tide of fortune has turned in favour of the North, and the sue

era attending the formidable preparations of the past six months is now ecompensing the Federalists for the enormous expenditure winch has suighed heavily upon them. In former letters I have had occasion to iotice the' mprovement in the discipline of the Union Army, which has been gradually progressingowards a state of efficiency nuclei the

guidance and supervision ci the new Commander-in-Chief. To brigade

regiments, form divisions, and appoint divisional generals, were among

the first tasks which WCleUan set himself to accomplish; and, having succeeded in these, he published a series of general orders for the better regulation and conduct of military matters, and providing for a more thorough and perfect state of discipline through every branch of the service. The consequence is, that during all these apparently idle months the soldier's taskmaster, the drill-sereai, has been abroad, and now as the time approaches for action ille .nederal Government finds it has an army to rely on for support or 'vindication, astounding in its numbers as the growth of only nine months, and wondsrf ufly efficient considering the shortperiod it has been in the field. The combinations

of the General-in-Chief are now being seen and understood, and those

who have arraigned him in judgment before the court of their displeasure we now compelled to acknowledge their error, confuted by the successes that ha'veinaugtirated the firalpart of anew campaign. The 'victories in North Oarlina, Kentucky, and Tennessee, have dealt a staggering blow at secession; while the Federal troops, hitherto depressed by their early discomfitures, are now elated and confident, placing implicit reliance in their General, and being eager to carry the flag of the Union into t.heheartof Secessia. I am no "Sir Oracle," so l will not attempt to prophesy a triumph for the Federalists; but, seeing the improved condition in the morale of the Union forces, and feeling somewhat competent to give an opinion, I am inclined to believe that these first successes are not to be their last. I have watched the iothern army almost from its first appearance in the field. I have seen it a strijding, and known it in its bobedeyhoyhood the prey of bullying politicians, who by their pernicious counsels are responsible fo its ea.rliest defeats. mow see it arrived at man's estate, and it should or ought to achieve for itself an hononrable futm'v.

 My last letter was dated from Panilico Sound, North Carolina, on

the eve of the departure of the ezpedLitition to which I was attached

to attack oanoke Island. The rumours of an impending advance of the army of the Potomac and the distant sounds of victory from the west reached us even there, and I determined immediately Roanoke was taken, to hasten back to head-quarters, ready to witness what must be the most decisive and important movement of the campaign-the attack on the Confederate centre at Manassas. And here 1 am, after a delay of some days, caused by the prevalence of fearful storms on the coast, heartily sick of combined naval and military expeditions, and thoroughly determined to have nothing more to do with them, rimless I can first of all make a satisfactory arrangement with the clerk of the weather.

The telegraphic accounts of the success of General Burnside reached

New York, and thence were dispatched to England long before I could send you sketches in connection with the capture of Roanoke, so I will not attempt to give any elaborate details, and will simply confine myself to a brief description of the incidents which form the subjects illustrated by my pencil.

On the morning of the 7th the fleet of transports and gun-boats which had lain off the entrance of Crotan Sound during the previous night weighed anchor, the latter forming into line of battle in three divisions. The entrance into Crotan Sound is by a narrow channel scarcely more then one hundred feet in width, the navigation of which is exceedingly difficult, as a sandbar lies immediately o the mouth. However, the entire fleet, with one exception, were safely through by 10 am., and at half-past the first gun was fired from the Confederate battery, evidently as a signal of some kind or other. The mainland of North Carolina lay on our left, and this we had to hug closely for two miles or so, the deep water running there. Every moment I expected to see a puff of white smoke followed by a whiz come from among the tall brakes on the bank, but for some reason or other the Confederates had neglected placing a battery here, which appears to me the more astonishing from the fact that at any time during this two miles I could have almost thrown a biscuit on shore. After the above distance the channel made a curve to the right towards Roanoke, passing under the guns of the first fort and continuing along the sands to the extreme point of the island, with two other forts commanding it at equal distances from the first, they being so arranged that's, cross fire could be brought to bear on vessels attempting to force their way through. Between the first and second 'forts lay the Confederate steamers, seven in number, and the action was commenced at long range between them and the Federal gun-boats as the latter advanced steadily in line to the attack. At half-past eleven Fort Bsrtow chimed in as the Federal squadron came within its range, and it was now that the Spalding, on board which ship I was, with the General and his Staff, opened fire from her rifled Parrott. In a few minutes the plan of the action was somewhat changed, the Confederate steamers retiring behind some obstructions placed in the channel, and moving up towards the entrance to Afoemarle Sound, evidently with the purpose of drawing a portion of the Union vessels through the narrow opening left, and immediately under the guns of the second fort. Thin was seen and understood by

battery, the latter getting up two of his regiments first, the 9th 'New

York or Hawkins's Zouavea and the 21st Massachusetts. General

Park e,  he reached the flank of the breastwork, ordered the

above two regicoentB to charge, which they did in the most brilliant

manner, dashing through the swamp and over the stumps of the

pine-clearing, and into the battery which the Confederates were lisatily leaving. One officer alone, Lieutenant Selden, of the Richmond Blues, remained to dispute its possession. In my sketch (engraved on page 298) be is seen filling back from the parapet, dying as a gallant soldier should, with his face to the enemy. All could see him to the very last proud and erect, waving his sword and encouraging the men to stand. But his example was lost upon them, their panic was complete and Lieutenant Selden, whose gallantry had been unavailing, 'I saw laiI carefully in a sheltered spot ten minutes after he fell. The Confederates now retreated to the upper portion of the island, hastily pursued by Reno, who had with him but a small portion of his force. Foster also passed on with his men towards the rear of the water battery that had engaged the gun-boats throughout the previous dy, and, coming upon an intersecting path that led to it, he ordered the 4th Rhode Islanders to advance at the double and take it, which they proceeded to do with a deafening cheer. On rushing into the works they found, to their astonishment, the place deserted and guns spiked. The garrison, hearing of the defeat of their force in the centre of the island, and foreseeing an attack in the rear, had evacuated the place and retired in the sane direction as their beaten comrades. At Camp Georgia the entire Confederate force that had not succeeded in making its escape by way of Nag's Head was come up with by Genoral Reno, and, after firing a few shots, they surrendered in a mass, numbering nearly 3000 all told, 1500 having got across iloanoke and retired to Currituck with old General Wise, whose son was killed in the engagement at the fieldwork. Thus was Roanoke Island captured by the Federalists, their success giving them the command of all the inland water8of North Carolina, and a capital basis for operations on the mainland, which will he commenced immediately. The entire loss of the Unionists does not exceed 260 killed and wounded, though had the Confederates shown anything like a fight at their fieldwork the number might have been quadrupled. lam inclined to think that the latter, with 4r500 men and their strong natural positions, should have held at bay the Federal force brought against them - but more" kudos," therefore, is to be allowed the 'victors.

 With regard to the sentiment of the people on the island, it appears

tome to be quite as much one wayasthe other. I thick ali they want is to be let alone by both parties. The following were more especially the sentiments of a Mr. .Tarvis, farmer and fisherman, whose house had been taken possession of by the Zonaves: be was a perfectly bewildered individual. His family was in one of the negro shanties, and he was outside, mourning over the events of the day. Re bad "nothing agin the North," and had sold a great many shad, to go there. But the troops had killed one of his pigs, and his wife had lost her temper and her fiat irons. "Do you own any negroes, Mr. Jarvis ?" queried I, "Well, I did, but three of 'em went to Hatteras last week, two more have run away, I don't know where, and there's one in the kitchen I'll give away if anybody wants him 1" It was a clear case of unmistakable collapse. He was assured by one of the Staff who was present, that his remaining property should be protected, and that all deficiencies should be made good. if he was loyal.

I shall now send you some interesting subjects of the difficulties of transport, and the cause of the delay in the advance of the army of the Potomac, owing, as it is, entirely to the dreadful state of the Virginia roads. The first sign of dry weather will be hailed with delight by the men, who know they are to move from the camps where

they have passed six months of monotonous existence. F. V.
On the morning of the 7th the fleet of transports and gun-boats which had lain off the entrance of (Jrotan Sound dining the previous night weighed anchor, the latter forming into line of battle an three divisions. The entrance into Crotan Sound is by a narrow channel scarcely more than one hundred feet in widths the navigation of which is exceedingly difficult, as a sandbar lies immediately off the mouth. However, the entire fleet, with one exception, were safely through by 10 a.m., and at half-past the first gun was fired from the Confederate battery, evidently as a signal of some kind or other. The mainland of North Carolina lay on our left, and this we had to hug closely for two miles pr so, the deep water running there. Every moment I expected to see a puff of white smoke followed by a whiz come from among the tall brakes on the bank, but for some reason or other the Confederates had neglected placing a battery here, which appears to me the more astonishing from the fact that at any time during this two miles I could have almost thrown a biscuit on shore. After the above distance the channel made a curve to the right towards Itoancke, passing under the guns of the first fort and continuing along the sands to the extreme point of the island, with two other forte commanding it at equal distances from the first, they being so arranged that a cross firs could be brought to bear on vessels attempting to force their way through. Between the first and second forts lay the Confederate steamers, seven in number, and the action was commenced at long range between them and the Federal gnu-boats as the latter advanced steadily in line to the attack. At half-past eleven Fort Bartow chimed in as the Federal squadron came within its range, and it was now that the Spalding, on board which ship I was, with the General and his Staff, opened fire from her rifled Perrott. In a few minutes the plan of the action was somewhat changed, the Confederate steamers retiring behind some obstructions placed in the channel, and moving up towards the entrance to Albeanarle Sound, evidently with the purpose of drawing a portion of the Union vessels through the narrow opening left, and immediately under the guns of the second fort. This was seen and understood by Commodore Gouldaborough, who detached half a dozen of his boats to block their passage back again, and to engage them as nearly as the obstructions in the channel would admit. This is the period of the action I have chosen for one of my Sketches (engraved on the preceding page). About two p.m. the Confederate fleet retired out of range, the largest vessel, the Curlew, being so damaged that they had to run her ashore under the shelter of a battery near the upper point of the main land to prevent her sinking. She was afterwards burnt by her crew, and the battery blown up to prevent it falling into the hands of the Federalists. At S p.m. the troops commenced landing, protected by the guns of the Picket and Delaware, who shelled from amongst the pines the force that had been drawn up to oppose the debarkation. At six the thing ceased between the Federal gun-boats and Fort Bartow, and by midnight upwards of 9000 men had been safely put on shore without accident.

 The difficulties the troops had to contend against in landing were great, the place chosen being a perfect swamp, which extended inland a distance of a quarter of a mile, and in which the men sank to their knees and waists, To make matters more uncomfortable, a thin cold rain fell throughout the night, the soldiers having no other shelter than what they stood in, and many of them were completely benumbed by daylight. Nothing disturbed the stillness of the dark hours save one solitary report of a gun whichhersldefl thedeath of alllassathusetta soldier who was thrown out in the forest as a picket: this was the only collision that occurred during the night. There was something F aliarlyinipressivein the gloom of the darkpine woods with the know

9ge that perbspa within a dozen yards lurked the enemy, and that

at any moment the watcher might be sent to his lest account.

Day broke cold, damp, and miserable; and, after a drink of water and

a biscuit each men, the Federal force prepared to advance into the inte

rior, following a path which led to the main artery running through the island. About ten the first collision took place between the opposing forces, at the point where the pathway alluded to above intersects the main road. Foster's brigade was the first to move forward, and he deployed his men to the right of the road in the woods, engaging the enemy's skirmishers as be felt his way step by step through thebrenat-high swamp. I followed this force. General Eeuo. then occupied the road with his brigade, forming the centre, while General Parke forced an opening through the roads and swamps on the left contending against the same difficulties that Foster and his men were encountering on the right. General Burnside directed the whole of the movements. From the cross road to the clearing in which the Confederates had three guns in a fieldwork, there was a continuous rattle of musketry, the fire from the concealed Secessionist skirmishers cutting up the Union men severely; in fact, even I, who you maybe sure kept in pretty setfe place, heard the bullets humming round as though a beehive had been overturned in the neigh. bournood. At midday the clearing was reached by the head of Benc's column, and its appearance was saluted by roundahot and grape from the fieldwork already mentioned. Daring this time Foster and Parke were each pushing on through immense obstacles to outflank the
