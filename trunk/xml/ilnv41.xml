<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer St. George we have telegrams from New
York vi&#xE0; Cape Race to the evening of the 23rd ult.</p>

<p rend="center"> BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Confederates made a bold dash on the 14th ult., with a force of
calvary and artillery, in the rear of General M'Clellan's army. They
passed round his right flank, cut the telegraph wires, and injured
the railway from West Point. They also destroyed forage and tents, took many prisoners, and retreated safely.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan's army before Richmond had been reinforced by the
corps under General M'Dowell. The weather was fine and the roads firm.</p>

<p>The Confederates opened fire upon the Federal fleet at City Point, on James River, but the batteries were silenced by the Federals.</p>

<p>General Jackson's forces are concentrated at Harrisonburg and Fort Republic, in the valley of the Shenandoah. He has been reinforced. General Fremont was falling back on Mount Jackson.</p>

<p>General Morgan, of the Federal army, reports, under date of the 18th, that he that day marched upon and occupied Cumberland gap, which the enemy evacuated four hours before his arrival. This gap is a pass in the Cumberland mountains, at a point where the boundary lines of the States of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee converge.</p>

<p>A meagre telegram from Cape Race announces that a bloody battle was
fought near Charleston on the 16th, with heavy loss on both sides. The
latest issue of the<hi rend="italic"> Charleston Mercury</hi>
expresses apprehension for the safety of the city.</p>

<p>The Confederates, 65,000 strong, were reported to be concentrated
at Grenada, Mississippi. Some fighting had taken place in the
neighbourhood of B&#xE2;ton Rouge, but the result was
unknown. General Pope had discontinued his pursuit of Beauregard, who
was last heard of at Montgomery, on his way to Richmond.</p>

<p>Vicksburg, on the Mississippi, still held out against the Federal
flotilla, which is about to be reinforced by the mortar fleet from New
Orleans.</p>

<p>It is confirmed that the British prize-ship Circassian had been condemned at Key West.</p>

<p>At New Orleans one man had been hanged for hauling down the Federal
flag from the Mint. At Memphis the Federal sentinels had received
orders to shoot any person attempting to lower the Federal flag or to
molest Union citizens.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>On the 17th the bill for the abolition of slavery in the
territories of the United States finally passed Congress. It is as
follows:&#x2014;</p>

<q>To the end that freedom may be and remain for ever the fundamental law
of the land in all places whatsoever so far as it lies within the power or
depends upon the action of the Government of the United States to make
it so, therefore be it enacted, &#x0026;c., that from and after the
passage of this Act there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude in any of the territories of the United States now existing,
or which may at any time hereafter be formed or acquired by the United
States, otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party
shall have been duly convicted.</q>

<p>A bill to free from servitude the slaves of certain "rebel" leaders
was passed in the House by a vote of 82 against 54.</p>

<p>Secretary Chase has announced that the Mississippi and its
tributaries are open for legitimate traffic as far as Memphis.</p>

<p>Prior to the departure of Lord Lyons from Washington he presented
Mr. Stewart, First Secretary of the Legation, to the State Department,
where he was duly recognised as Charg&#xE9; d'Affaires during his
Lordship's absence.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>M. Pierre Soul&#xE9; had arrived in New York, and was
incarcerated in Fort Lafayette.</p>

<p>Mr. Appleton Oaksmith, after a trial of five days, had been found
guilty by a New York jury of participating in the slave trade. The
punishment for the crime is five years' confinement in the State
prison and a fine of 5000 dollars, or in default of payment one year's
additional imprisonment for each 1000 dollars.</p>

<p>The export of specie to Europe continues, the steamer City of 
Washington alone having taken 2,400,000 dollars.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">London, Saturday, July 5, 1862</hi>.<lb/></p>
<p>...American news is full of incident, though the results of recent
operations do not seem to be important. General Jackson defeated
General Shields, the Federal, on the 9th of June, with much loss on
both sides; but Jackson's man&#x153;uvres were masterly, and he
joined his chief near Richmond. From that quarter there had been a
dash of Confederates, who had skirmished with the Unionists, and had
taken a more menacing attitude. The Confederates also made a brilliant
razzia on the 13th, turned the right flank of the Federals, cut up the
waggon-trains, killed the persons in charge, and made many
prisoners. Some bombardment, apparently of no great importance, is
reported, and we hear of a battery on White River. Beauregard was
entirely ruined, and his army scattered and demoralised, at the last
mail but one; but at the last mail of all he was at Okalona with
80,000 men, a "resuscitation" more wonderful than that which is
drawing all the town to Drury Lane. General Butler adheres to his
ruffianly New Orleans proclamation against the women, and a reign of
terrorism seems to be established both there and at Memphis. The House
of Representatives has passed a bill for confiscating the slaves of
rebels, a step which must involve very important considerations. To
whom do the slaves belong, or are they freed? If not, Uncle Sam
himself becomes their<sic corr="owner"> owners</sic>, and places himself where the great
serfowner in Russia, the Emperor, has refused to believe it safe to
remain. If they are to be freed, the General who sought to disarm
rebellion by a recent proclamation of a similar effect may complain of
rather harsh treatment in having been so severely censured for
"atrocious injustice." We may add that what are called the horrors of
war are now beginning to be understood by those whose churches are
converted into hospitals, and whose friends return, when they return
at all, fearfully mutilated by the newer and deadlier engines of
war.</p></div2>

operatives of the cotton-manufacturing districts had borne their
privations, but submitted that any interference on our part between
the Northern and Southern States might produce no other effect than an
aggravation of their sufferings. The Governments of England and
France would be delighted to offer their mediation if they saw any
prospect that such a step would be welcomed on the other side of the
Atlantic; but, for the present, he could only say that, if at any
future time there should be a fair opening for friendly counsel, it
would be the duty of the Government, as well as a great pleasure, to
take advantage of it.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent, in
his last letter from the Mississippi Flotilla, writes as follows
respecting the subject of the accompanying Engraving:&#x2014;"I take it that
the opening the Mississippi is not the least important among the many
movements of the Federal forces; indeed, it appears to me that Peace
and Commerce, hand in hand, will float down its broad bosom in the
wake of the flotilla, restoring confidence on their way by recalling
the suffering disaffected to their former avocations. Already 
numbers of refugees from the Confederate strongholds below us have
penetrated through the submerged forests in 'dug outs,' and have
requested to be allowed to take the oath of allegiance to the old
Government. Their description of the condition of the Southern cities
would scarcely indicate that the population is over sanguine as to the
result of the struggle progressing  or that its confidence is great
in the ultimate success of Confederacy. They say that the more quiet
and law-abiding portion of the people are crushed and held in
subjection by the military authorities, and that hundreds would
welcome the appearance of the Federal fleet and the restoration of
their former condition of order and prosperity. No doubt the
destruction of property will be great on the approach of the flotilla,
but this will be simply because the citizens are powerless to prevent
it; and I am strengthened in this opinion from a conversation I have
had with a Memphis merchant who is on the same boat as
myself. Possibly, however, these fugitives may wish to represent
matters to the Federal commander in a<hi rend="italic"> couleur de
rose</hi> tint, and therefore their statements should perhaps be
accepted with considerable reservation; yet I cannot conceive they
would fly from their homes and seek the protection of Uncle Sam had not their convictions
undergone a change, and their confidence in Jeff Davis and his power to
sustain his Government been greatly diminished."</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna and Nova Scotian we have news till the 1st inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Belligerent Operations.</hi></p>

<p>The Confederates had made another onslaught on the right wing of
the Federal army before Richmond. On the 26th uit.[sic], the
Confederates having been reinforced by General Stonewall Jackson,
attacked the Federals with heavy force. After two days' hard fighting
General M'Clellan found it necessary to withdraw his forces across the
Chickahominy, evacuating White House, but saving all the materiel
stored there. His army is now massed between the James and
Chickahominy Rivers, with the former as a base of operations.</p>

<p>The forces of Generals Fremont, Banks, and M'Dowell have been
consolidated into one army, and General Pope has been assigned to the
chief command. General Fremont asked to be relieved from his command
because of this arrangement. President Lincoln acceded to his request,
and appointed General Rufus King in his place.</p>

<p>The Southern account of the sharply-contested battle before
Charleston has been received. The Confederates claim the
victory. Their account is as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<q> A severe battle took place on the 16th on James Island, four miles
from this city (Charleston). Five regiments of Federals, with
artillery, attacked our batteries at Secessionville. Colonel Lamar
commanded the Confederates, and with a few hundred men repulsed the
enemy three times with great slaughter. The enemy fought bravely, but
were defeated. Our victory was complete. The enemy's loss is supposed
to be about 400, including forty prisoners. Our loss was 40 killed and
100 wounded, including one Colonel. We buried on the field 100
Federals.</q>

<p>The Federal accounts admit the defeat and acknowledge a loss of 660
killed, wounded, and missing. The Federals were obliged to retreat
under cover of their gun-boats. It is stated that General Benham will
be court-martialled for disobeying orders in attacking the batteries
before Charleston.</p>

<p>It is reported from New Orleans that Fort Morgan, at the entrance
to Mobile Bay, had capitulated to Commodore Porter.</p>

<p>On White River, in Arkansas, four gun-boats and a transport, having
on board one regiment, engaged and captured two batteries, with a loss
of 150 men scalded or drowned by the blowing up of a gun-boat. The
Confederate loss was about the same. The White River is now open to
commerce.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>President Lincoln had sent to the Senate a treaty made by
Mr. Corwin, the American Minister in Mexico, loaning to the Government
of Juarez 11,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>The War Department, in order to stimulate recruiting, had offered 2
dols. premium and one month's pay in advance to all recruits.</p>

<p>The Post-office Department has concluded an arrangement with the
Hamburg, Bremen, and Liverpool lines of steamers by which the fastest
steamers of each of those lines are accepted for the United States'
mail service throughout the year, thus securing a fast steamer for the
conveyance of the mails, on Saturdays from New York, and on Wednesdays
from Southampton or Liverpool. This arrangement had long been pressed
on the department by the commercial interests.</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives, the bill for the further issue of
150,000,000 dols. in Treasury notes was passed by 76 against 46. The
Senate's amendments to the Pacific Railroad Bill were concurred
in. The House also concurred in the Senate's amendments to the bill
prohibiting polygamy in the territories. The offence is punishable by
a fine not exceeding 500 dols. and imprisonment for five years. A
bill "increasing temporarily the duties on imports" has been reported
by the Committee of Ways and Means: it largely increases the duties on
iron, ironware, coal, drugs, dry goods of all kinds, fancy goods, and
miscellaneous articles generally.</p>

<p>The provisions of the Confiscation Act are very sweeping. They
confiscate the slaves of all persons engaged in the military or civil
service of the Confederate or separate State Governments of the
Seceding States.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">New Orleans.</hi></p>

<p>General Butler is still carrying things with a high hand in this
city. Four men have been hung for falsely representing themselves as
Federal officials, and in this character searching houses and stealing
articles therefrom.</p>

<p>The controversies with the foreign Consuls continue. General Butler
lays down the law that no foreigner has a right to buy sugar of
"rebel" owners and pay for it by bills drawn on England. General
Butler desires that the Consuls should not unite to present joint and
argumentative protests to him. The Consuls have unanimously protested
against the oath demanded by General Butler of foreigners. General
Butler defends the course he has taken, and politely suggests that if
foreign residents do not like the treatment they receive they can
leave the country, which they were never invited to visit.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The judgment against the British steamer Circassian declares that
papers were found on board giving conclusive proof of an intention to
run the blockade.</p>

<p>As the municipality of Norfolk still refused to take the oath 
of allegiance to the Federal Government martial law had been
proclaimed.</p>

<p>The people of Illinois, by direct popular vote, have adopted
amendments to their Constitution which prevent negroes and<orig reg="mulattoes"> mulattos</orig> from settling in that State.</p>

<p>Gold had risen to 9&#xBD; premium.</p>

<p rend="center">FORT PILLOW.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> give, at page 37, two Illustrations by
our Special Artist of this important stronghold&#x2014;by some esteemed the
strongest position on the Mississippi&#x2014;which the Confederates
abandoned on the 5th ult. Some particulars of the strength and
position of Pillow are given by the correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune.</hi> "The Bohemians," he says, "were
early on the ground, and began rambling up and down the Bluff, through
ravines and over hills, examining the batteries, the deserted camps,
and the ruined barracks, sketching the situation, entering magazines,
and doing all the necessary but disagreeable duties that appertain to
their avocation. The situation of the Mississippi at Pillow is most
favourable for defence. The river at Craighead Point makes a very
sudden bend, running nearly north and south, and narrowing so
remarkably that at the lower end of the works it is not more than half
a mile wide, and at their first batteries is about three-quarters of a
mile; bringing all boats within easy range of their guns, and
rendering their escape almost an impossibility. Below the point there
are two large sandbars which render navigation quite difficult. The
fort, by which I mean the series of fortifications, is on the first
Chickasaw Bluff, is composed of nine different works, extending about
half a mile. The bluff is some 80ft. high, very precipitous and
rugged, furnishing an excellent location for defence. The works
erected at the base of the bluff and on the bank, at some distance
from the river, are very well and carefully built for about fifty
guns. The country about the fort is exceedingly uneven and rough, and
presents the most formidable obstacles to pedestrians
everywhere. There are deep ravines, steep ascents, wild gorges, sudden
and unexpected declivities on every hand; while in the rear of the
fort there is an unbroken line of heavy and carefully-built
breastworks, some seven miles in length, to resist any and all attacks
by land. These breastworks are far superior, considering their length,
to any others which I have seen during the war. Usually they are
merely thrown-up embankments of earth; but these are regularly and
scientifically made, with broad parapets, heavy escarpments, and
counterscarps neatly lined with timber and firmly secured by
deeply-driven posts."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">There</hi> has been fighting about five miles
from Charleston, but the affair, although of course dignified into "a
battle," and sensationised with a very strong adjective, was not
important, nor was there much slaughter. Some gun-boat business is
loosely reported, and we are told of one really fearful catastrophe&#x2014;a
Confederate shot having shattered the steam-drum of a Federal vessel,
and nearly all who were on board having perished, either by scalding
or drowning. Of other operations the news is too vague to be worth
transcription. The Federal army before Richmond was said to he
suffering most severely from fever, and it was even rumoured that
General M'Clellan himself had been seized by it. The Legislature had,
however, performed a far more important act than had been achieved by
the Generals; for the new tariff, which is almost prohibitory of
foreign importations, is a measure which will array all the mercantile
interests of England and France against the Union. Should this new
enactment upon further examination sustain the character at present
attributed to it the French and English Governments will find it difficult to abstain from a recognition of
the South. We have to add that General Butler, whose<pb n="31"/> ruffianly
proclamation against the ladies of New Orleans is defended by some of
the New York journals, is embroiling himself with foreign Consuls
there in a way that may make it necessary to interfere somewhat
promptly with proceedings conceived in the united spirit of a low
attorney and a brutal cateran.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi>THE TEXTILE MANUFACTURES IN THE INTERNATIONAL
EXHIBITION &#x2014; BRITISH AND FOREIGN.</hi>.<lb/></p>
<p>...Have we not seen how the very anticipation of even a short supply
of one of these materials&#x2014;cotton alone&#x2014;has agitated the lending
nations of Europe?&#x2014;how the immense monopoly which one portion of the
earth has been permitted to enjoy in the production of this 
now indispensable material has led to an arrogant assumption of a
right to defy the laws of a great federation and trample on the
freedom of a section of mankind unrestrained and unchecked? Such is
the importance to which the great development of one portion of the
textile industry of Great Britain has attained in our day that it was
supposed that Englishmen would become accomplices in a great crime
rather than allow the possibility of any limitation to its
progress. . . .</p>

<p>A few earnest men, such as Mr. Thomas Bazley, M.P., and Mr. Henry
Ashworth, have not been idle during the decade in endeavouring to draw
public attention to the question of a supply of cotton from some 
source over which we have more control than that of the Southern
States of America, but with what a poor result until the calamity of a
dearth was upon us! The other day Mr. Bazley called the attention of
an influential audience at the Royal Institution to the subject,
especially pointing out the Island of Jamaica as a source whence we
might expect a good supply of cotton of a suitable staple; it may,
therefore, not be without interest to see what we said in these pages
on this very subject when considering the cotton exhibits in the Great
Exhibition. The views then expressed (May 31, 1851) were:&#x2014;"That the
Southern States of America cannot continue to supply our wants, as
hitherto, with any degree of certainty, seems a settled question with
those who best understand the peculiar position of the United States,
and at the same time take into consideration the requirements of our
manufacturers; apart from the fact that it would be unwise to continue
to suffer the immense population of our cotton-manufacturing districts
to depend upon an institution so uncertain in its character as slavery
certainly is, for any movement which might take place in the Slave
States of the American Union, by which its present servile population
should temporarily suspend their industrial pursuits as cultivators of
cotton, would inevitably tell with frightful effect upon the industry
of the north of England and of Scotland in the suspension of trade for
the want of raw material. This question, therefore, of the source
whence our future cotton supply is to come is of infinitely more
importance in a national and social point of view than at first sight
appears; for it is a fact which cannot be too often brought forward
for the consideration of 'the powers that be,' both home and colonial,
that the great staple trade of probably one-third of the population of
England and Scotland is mainly dependent, at the present time, for
employment and almost for existence upon the worst institution of
modern times, the slavery of the Southern States of America; and,
without seeking to become alarmists, it would be a dereliction of duty
not to take an opportunity like the present to endeavour to bring this
fact more prominently forward than hitherto. With our East India
possessions, with Natal, and many of our colonies, particularly some
of the West India Islands, where cotton is indigenous to the soil, but
where it has been neglected for far less profitable and important
matters, we may, if those who guide our affairs think of it, do great
things towards supplying our own wants; and, whilst contriving to keep
up our trade with the United States, to be less dependent upon them,
and induce them to supply even their own wants in a more satisfactory
way then at present."</p>

<p> The writer subsequently visited the United States in a capacity
which enabled him to examine thoroughly into the industrial pursuits
of the people. His impressions as to the danger of the British cotton
manufacture continuing, for all practical purposes, solely dependent
upon the Slave Slates of America for the supply of raw material were
confirmed, and to-day we see the very calamity foreshadowed in the
passage of the quotation from these pages of eleven years ago, a stern
reality; nor did it require the gift of prophecy to see this. Had our
rulers been statesman for the present and future, instead of followers
of a dead past in routine and precedent, or had our Manchester friends
shown a little more logical foresight at all parallel to that
shrewdness and intelligence which they display in every-day matters,
they must have seen the error, to use a familiar illustration, of
"placing all their eggs in one basket," apart altogether from their
unintentional complicity with a system which it is revolting to
contemplate, and which has borne, and will continue to bear, its own
bitter fruits. The taunt which Englishmen had to put up with when
visiting the United States, that "cotton ruled England, and the
Southern States ruled cotton," is now a thing of the past. We must
proceed at once to help ourselves; for we venture to predict, and with
the certainty of a realisation quite as full as that which has
followed the warning of 1851, that whenever England gets cotton again
from the Southern States of America it will be the result of a
cultivation of the soil by <hi rend="italic">free</hi> men and women,
unstained by the brand of slavery. Half a generation, which is quite
as short a period as we can expect, may elapse before this change can
be effected, but it is as inevitable as Truth and as inexorable as
Justice.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi>THE CASE OF THE EMILY ST. PIERRE</hi>.</p>
<p>The official correspondence respecting the above vessel has been published.</p>
<p>On the 24th of April Mr. Adams wrote to Earl Russell on the
subject, and transmitted certain depositions relating to her
seizure. Mr. Adams contended that the act committed by Captain Wilson,
the master of the neutral vessel, entailed her confiscation and that of
the cargo, and asked that directions might be given for their restoration.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May Earl Russell replied that, having taken the
opinion of the law officers, the Government were unable to comply,
inasmuch as acts of forcible resistance to the rights of belligerents
on the high seas were not cognisable by the municipal law of England,
however punishable as offences against international law in the prize
courts of the captor administering such law.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams replied by quoting the language of Lord Stowell, by which
he considered the restoration of the vessel is called for, and by
pointing to the language of her Majesty's proclamation, which, he
thinks, was intended to apply to precisely such cases as this.</p>

<p>The Foreign Minister rejoined that Lord Stowell's language was
limited to the action of a prize court of the captor, and does not
extend to the municipal law of a neutral country. Chancellor Kent is
quoted at some length by the noble Lord, who concludes by saying that
the meaning of the proclamation was that any breach of the statute
would be punished under the statute by the same national authority by
which the statute was enacted.</p>

<p>In a despatch which occupies three pages and a half of the printed
return Mr. Adams reviews the arguments of the noble Lord and what he
considers the recognised doctrines of international law, coming to the
conclusion that the claim for the restoration of the ship rests on the
soundest principles of equity and law. The restitution, he says, of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell was not required by any portion of the
municipal law of the United States, and the United States' Government
restored them simply because the seizure seemed to have been wrongful,
as construed by the law of nations. If the Royal proclamation is to be
made so null and void, foreign nations must, he says, adopt more
stringent measures of repression, "in order to bring down with real
effect upon her subjects the just consequences of her Majesty's
displeasure for their violation of her will." The Government and
people of the United States had expected some mark of indignation on
the part of her Majesty's Government. "The decision has been
otherwise. Made wiser by the result, they will take the necessary
precautions in like cases that may happen hereafter to protect
themselves."</p>

<p> Writing on the 12th ult., the Foreign Minister endeavours to
convince Mr. Adams that it is a general principle that each nation
deals only with offences committed against its own laws, and is not
called upon to carry into effect, or to aid in carrying into effect,
the laws of foreign nations against persons who may have violated them
and who may be found within its territory. "Not only in the case of
neutrals in war, but in all cases falling within the same general
principle, the nation to whom the parties complained of belong leaves
to other nations who may suffer by the acts of such parties the
penalty. It may happen that the nation receiving the injury may have
an opportunity of resenting it should it perchance catch the offenders
within its jurisdiction. Had the Emily St. Pierre fallen a second time
into the hands of a United States' cruiser, a prize court of the
United States would in all probability have condemned the ship and
cargo. Nor would her Majesty's Government have complained of a
condemnation judicially pronounced in accordance with the law of
nations. Her Majesty's Government, adhering to this line of conduct,
are, therefore, acting in accordance with reason, policy, and the
common and universal usage of nations in like cases. You speak of the
rescue of the Emily St. Pierre as being a fraud by the law of
nations. But whether the act of rescue be viewed as one of fraud or of
force, or as partaking of both characters, the act was done only
against the rights accruing to a belligerent under the law of nations
relating to war, and in violation of the law of war, which, whilst it
permits the belligerent to exercise and enforce such rights against
neutrals by the peculiar and exceptional right of capture, at the same
time leaves to the belligerent alone the duty, and confers upon him
the power, of vindicating such rights and of enforcing such law. The
same law not only does not require, but does not even permit, neutral
nations to carry out belligerent rights. You allude to the conduct of
the United States' Government in the case of the Trent; but the
flagrant wrong done in that case was done by a naval officer in the
service of the United States; the prisoners whose release was demanded
were in the direct custody and keeping of the executive Government;
and the Government of the United States had actually the power to
deliver them up, and did deliver them up, to the British
Government. But the Emily St. Pierre is not in the power of the
executive Government of this country, and the laws of England, as well
as the law of nations, forbid the executive Government from taking
away that ship from its legal owners."</p>

<p>Mr. Adams's reply, on the following day, is a simple acknowledgment
of the above note, with the remark, "As I do not perceive that its
contents materially change the nature of the issue that had been
already made up, I shall content myself with the transmission of a
copy, to complete the correspondence on the subject, to the Government
of the United States."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">NORTHERN REVERSES</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Through</hi> the haze of the telegrams brought
to this country by the China and the preceding packets from New York
and Quebec, dimly outlining such information from the principal seats
of war as the Government at Washington thought fit to give to the
American public, looms the fact that the Federal arms have sustained a
succession of serious reverses. The Confederate General, "Stonewall"
Jackson, suddenly quitting the valley of the Shenandoah and crossing
the mountainous district lying between it and Richmond, fell upon
General M'Clellan's right wing, and succeeded, after three days'
sanguinary conflicts, in driving it back behind his centre and left
wing, on the other side of the Chickahominy River. Another battle,
fought on Sunday, June 29, probably resulted in a still more important
defeat of M'Clellan's forces (subsequently confirmed by the news
brought by the Jura), since the Secretary of War forbad the Northern
press to publish any detailed news. It is clear, however, that things
have gone unfortunately with the Federals, or President Lincoln would
hardly have issued a proclamation calling for 300,000 additional
troops, much less would a cry have been raised for a conscription, if
necessary. But ground has been lost elsewhere than before
Richmond. James Island, lying in close contiguity to Charleston, has
been evacuated by the troops under General Hunter, and the campaign
against that city has been indefinitely suspended. The position of
General Curtis in Arkansas had become so precarious that he is
reported to have retired into Missouri. Vicksburg, on the Mississippi,
still remains in possession of the Confederates, although the latest
news states that its bombardment by twenty Federal vessels had
commenced. Altogether, Northern prospects have become gloomy; the
idea of mediation appears to be entertained with some show of favour;
and the night before the China steamer sailed from New York an
enthusiastic public meeting in favour of peace was held in that
city. If these latter statements can be safely taken as indicating a
turn in the current of public sentiment, we might almost indulge the
hope that the conclusion of this most disastrous war cannot be very
far off.</p>

<p> Summer heat has now entered upon its allotted term on the American
continent, and what that means in the Southern States the shiploads of
sick men sent back to New York may faithfully, but only faintly, make
manifest. A tropical sun acting upon an immense extent of unreclaimed
forest and swamp fearfully tries the vigour of even an acclimatised constitution. When associated
with the toils and hardships, the broken rest, and the coarse and
irregular fare of camp life, it becomes a more merciless foe than men,
however infuriated and in whatever force, can prove themselves. Its
power is unseen and intangible, and therefore irresistible. It is at
work along the whole line night and day. No resolution, no discipline,
no bravery, can fight it off. The havoc it has already played with
M'Clellan's army far exceeds that inflicted by the arms of his
adversaries, and as yet the unhealthy season has but initiated its
rule. For several weeks previously the commander had reiterated the
most urgent demand for reinforcements, and it was only just before the
late reverses that General M'Dowell had succeeded in joining him with
his division. The telegram tells us that in the collision before
Richmond, M'Clellan was driven from his position on the Pamunkey River
and the White House "with great loss," and that "there was fearful
carnage on both sides." Quite irrespectively, therefore, of his
strategical loss, which, by changing his position, has increased his
disadvantages, if not involved his army in danger, it seems evident
that he will be unable to resume the offensive, even if he succeeds in
holding his ground, until after the solstitial months. Protracted
inaction during the coming three months, at least in Virginia, would
appear to be the best prospect which the case of the Northern army
will now admit of, and there is a possibility that it may have to face
a far more gloomy one. The 300,000 additional men called for by the
President will not be available for the purposes of the closing
campaign, and Northern patience and persistence are doomed to undergo
a further and much severer test than it has yet sustained.</p>

<p>We record these Federal reverses with unfeigned regret. We are
conscious of no inclination to allow the unreasonable petulance into
which the baffled hopes of a young and self-confident community have
temporarily betrayed it to alienate our sympathies from the principles
with which, whether it means so or not, its conduct in this struggle
is inseparably identified. We cannot find pleasure in its humiliation,
nor gratify our own violated self-respect by taunting it with the
collapse of its vainglorious boasts. But it would be childish to
attempt to pass any delusion upon ourselves as to the stern
significance of the facts before us. We see in them, indeed, no proof
that the North is essentially inferior to the South in military
qualities. We do not trace them to lack either of courage, of
discipline, or of generalship. But we do ascribe them to the nature of
the enterprise upon which the North saw fit, although under great
provocation, to embark. All subsidiary chances are against them, for
the simple reason that they are invaders of the soil of a hostile
people. They can command no accurate information because the
inhabitants of the Southern States regard them with fiercest
hate&#x2014;they are not familiar with the regions into which they seek to
penetrate. They cannot choose their own ground, nor determine where or
when battle shall be given them. Political reasons, if not strategical
exigencies, have compelled them to distribute their forces over a vast
surface, and every important place that they take must be held by
garrisons detached from the main army. Their antagonists, on the
contrary, move about amid a sympathising population, know every
movement of every part of the invading force, are free to select the
positions they will abandon or hold, and, by surrendering minor
advantages, can concentrate nearly their whole military power at will
upon any one point. It will require immense superiority in men and means to balance these
advantages, and it is no discredit to the military character of the
North that it has not succeeded where European arms would have
certainly failed. Its miscarriage is almost inevitable; for, although
it may tear out the word "impossibility" from its dictionary, the
stubborn impracticability of geographical facts and of physical and
moral laws will successfully defy it. Its only chance was bound up
with the hope that the rebellion was the work of a dominant faction
rather than the deliberate resolve of a whole population. When that
hope was shattered every likelihood of ultimate success was shattered
with it.</p>

<p>The question now presents itself whether, during the coming three
months of compulsory inaction, the North will hang on to its
determination to reinstate the South in the Union with the same
desperate tenacity of purpose it has hitherto exhibited. Already a
peace party makes itself heard, and the alternative of mediation
begins to be discussed. With the evidence before us of the singular
want of correspondence, from the very beginning of this war, between
European predictions and American events, we will not be rash enough
to forecast the probabilities of the future. But we may venture to say
that such moral certainties as are within view do not favour a belief
that another campaign must precede the termination of
hostilities. That, no doubt, is at the present moment the fixed
intention of the Government at Washington; perhaps, also, it is the
preponderant resolution of a majority of the people. But there is no
saying how long it will remain so. In the first place, all the
sober-minded and well-informed classes of society must have become
sceptical, to say the least, of the feasibility of the enterprise upon
which they started, and of its desirability even if it is considered
feasible. The temper of the Southern people can no longer be
mistaken. Their attachment to the cause of Secession has been tried by
the severest vicissitudes, but has never wavered even for a moment. No
compromise will entice them back&#x2014;no offer to concede their largest
claims. This fact has become undeniable, and a protraction of the war
can hardly be persisted in with the expectation of practically
disproving it. The main object for which the North so enthusiastically
welcomed privation, suffering, debt, taxation, and even death, may be
said to have disappeared. Will not this fact take the heart out of
resolution? Immense losses have been incurred--immense sacrifices are
further required; and there is no reasonable hope that either the one
or the other will be of ultimate avail. For several weeks to come
there will probably be no tidings calculated to excite or feed
national ambition. Swollen sick-lists, commercial disquietude, the
rapid exportation of bullion, high prices, and the first call of the
tax-gatherer, are not very well adapted to shore up a bulging and
undermined determination to persevere. Should the North give way to
inevitable necessity, or, as Napoleon III. describes it, to "the
inexorable logic of facts," before the middle of October next, and
should it invite mediation in place of rushing into a new campaign, it
will be only yielding to the force of motives which all the world over
are powerful to influence reasonable minds.</p>

<p>That the statesmen and people of Federal America may feel their way
to a settlement of this terrible quarrel before the close of the
summer heats will be, we are sure, the most earnest desire of
Englishmen of all political parties. They are convinced that free
institutions are never in greater peril than during the convulsions of
civil strife. They can discover no possible compensation in the future
either of Europe or of America for such a miserable waste of life and
resources as another campaign would entail. Perhaps they are not
wholly disinterested in their desire for the restoration of
peace. But, whether their own industry would be profited or otherwise
by the sheathing of the sword, it is certain that the dictates of
humanity alone would suffice to make them hail with delight any
probable prospect of witnessing the end of a contest which, in
political and moral as well as in social and commercial respects, has
proved the most calamitous event of modern times.</p>

<p>There has been a succession of conflicts between the Confederate
army, commanded by General Jackson, and the right wing of the Federal
forces. The Federal account of the result is that it was part of
M'Clellan's plan to withdraw his forces from across the Chickahominy
and concentrate them on the James River, along which they might
advance on Richmond in company with the gun-boats, seventeen of which
are at hand. This movement, which leaves the left wing of the old
position in the situation of the right wing of the new, was
interrupted by repeated attacks from the Confederates. The Federals
affirm that they were not beaten in any of these conflicts, and that,
though suffering severely themselves, they always inflicted heavier
losses on the assailants. No guns were lost since the 27th ult., when
General M'Call's division was at first overwhelmed and twenty-five
pieces fell into the hands of the enemy. On the other hand, the
Confederate General Magruder has been captured. The evacuation of the
several places was effected without any loss of stores or baggage. The
position now occupied by the Federals near Turkey Bend, on the James
River, is much healthier than that in the swamp country bordering on
the Chickahominy.</p>

<p>The Confederates claim to have captured 12,000 prisoners, all
M'Clellan's siege guns, and supplies sufficient to last the
Confederate army for three months. Richmond, accordingly, has been
illuminated.</p>

<p>As no details have yet been allowed to appear, it is impossible to
estimate the losses on either side, The Richmond <hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi> confesses that one division, which went
into the fight on Friday, the 27th, 14,000 strong, could only muster
6000 for duty on the following Tuesday, and that the sacrifice of life
exceeds that of any battle yet fought. M'Clellan's head-quarters were
established on Malvern Hills, one mile back of Turkey Bend.</p>

<p>The Federals had captured the Confederate gun-boat Teaser in
James River.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan had issued an address to the army declaring that
the Federals shall enter Richmond, and that the Union shall be
preserved, no matter what the cost of time, treasure, and blood.</p>

<p>The Federals had evacuated James Island, near Charleston, and
returned to Hilton Head. The summer campaign against Charleston had 
been suspended. Since the evacuation of James Island the Confederates
have been threatening Port Royal, in the same State. General Hunter,
commanding in this department, acknowledges, in reply to an inquiry
from Congress, that, in default of reinforcements from New York, he
had drilled and armed fugitive negroes, and that by the end of the
autumn he would present to the Government from 48,000 to 50,000 "of
these hardy and devoted soldiers."</p>

<p>Vicksburg continued to hold out against the Federal fleet. The 
Federal Commander was employing his troops to cut a canal across 
the land opposite the city, so as to change the course of the
Mississippi and render Vicksburg an inland town.</p>

<p>The Federal General Curtis was in a perilous condition in
Arkansas. He was unable to procure supplies, and his army had been
reduced to half rations for a week. The enemy, under Pike, 6000 strong,
were moving from Fort Smith to take him in the rear.</p>

<p>The first train from Memphis to Corinth was attacked by the
Confederate cavalry and captured twelve miles from Memphis. It
contained eighty mule-teams with provender-waggons, and a company of
an Ohio regiment, besides several officers and railway officials, who
were all captured.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>President Davis had informed the Governor of Georgia that the
conscription was necessary to ensuring the success of the
Confederacy.</p>

<p>General Beauregard had published a letter in the Mobile <hi rend="italic">News</hi> denying the capture by General Pope of 10,000
prisoners, as telegraphed by General Halleck. He says that 100 or 200
stragglers would cover all the prisoners he took, and about 500
damaged muskets to boot. All that the Confederates lost during the
retreat would not amount, he says, to one day's expense of the
enemy's army.</p>

<p>All the clergymen of Nashville had refused to take the oath of
allegiance to the Federal Government. Most of them had been confined
in the Penitentiary.</p>

<p>General Butler had issued a new form of oath for foreigners at New
Orleans. Instructions had been sent to him from Washington to cease
all further correspondence with the foreign diplomatic agents and to
leave such matters to the Department of State.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>President Lincoln, urged by a petition signed by eighteen Governors 
of loyal States, had called for a levy of 300,000 additional troops.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives had passed the Tariff Bill.</p>

<p>A meeting of the Conservative members of Congress had been held in the Capitol.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Personal.</hi></p>

<p>The Comte de Paris and the Duc de Chartres have quitted the Federal army and returned to Europe.</p>

<p>General "Stonewall" Jackson, the hero of the recent rencontres with
the Federals, is a native of Virginia, where he was born in 1825. He
graduated at West Point in the same class with M'Clellan in 1846. He
fought through the Mexican War, which he entered as a Second
Lieutenant and quitted as a Major. A description of him in a New York
paper is to this effect:--</p>

<q>As for his outer man, he looks at least seven years older then
he is--his height about five feet ten inches; his figure thick-set,
square-shouldered, and decidedly clumsy; his gait very awkward,
stooping, and with long strides. He often walks with his head somewhat
on one side, and his eyes fixed upon the ground, imparting to his
whole appearance that abstracted quality which young ladles describe
as absent-minded. A lady who has known him long and well has told me
that she never saw him on horseback without laughing--short stirrups,
knees cramped up, heels stuck out behind, and chin on his breast--a
most unmilitary phenomenon. In society he is quiet but cheerful, not
loquacious, but intelligent and shrewd; in religion the bluest kind of
a Presbyterian, and extremely strict in his church observances. In
Winchester he took a very active part in revivals, and habitually led
the Union prayer meetings.</q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>A large anti-abolition meeting had been held in and around the Cooper Institute, New York.</p>

<p>Gold had advanced to 10 per cent premium, and the exchange 
on London had reached a higher quotation than at any period since
1837. American stocks and bonds were being sent over for sale in large
quantities by European holders.</p></div2>

<p>We are menaced  with a prolongation of the Parliamentary

by legislative action for the relief of the thousands who have been
reduced to distress by the American fratricidal war. We are unaware of
any valid reason for the expectation that the Session would terminate
much earlier than usual, and we are equally unable to see why a
measure upon the justice and humanity of which all must agree need
occupy many nights in discussion. We perceive, however, that, in
anticipation of the bill, the Manchester organs are calling upon the
landowners of the distressed district to lay down vast sums as
contributions to the relief fund for those whom the manufacturing
interest has congregated in such dense swarms around its factories,
and it is not impossible that ungraceful demonstrations may be made
on both sides.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>
<p rend="right">The Gayoso House, Memphis, Tennessee,</p>
<p rend="right">June 10.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">After</hi> six weeks of cramped existence on a
Mississippi transport, I again find myself enjoying some of the
comforts of civilisation. The limited area of a state-room of the smallest dimensions has changed to an
apartment of such proportions that I am almost tempted to write a new
version of "Une Voyage autour de ma Chambre." But either to write or
draw with the thermometer at 100 deg. in the shade is a task so
laborious, and one's energies become so lymphatic under the moistening
influences of heat, that I must content me with relating facts and
eschew the realms of fancy.</p>

<p>Memphis, the hotbed of Secession, has fallen. The proud city that 
would never surrender to the Northern vandal is now garrisoned by
Federal soldiers; the blackened, smoking ruins that were to have
greeted the advent of the invader was an empty boast; the streets 
"bathed in blood" but a figurative piece of bombast, for which the
editor of<hi rend="italic"> The Appeal</hi> is responsible. Commodore
Davis, who commands the national flotilla, need scarcely have wasted
words in writing his despatch. "I came, I saw, I conquered," would
have expressed everything. Never was a success so complete and so
cheaply purchased by the victors; never an enemy so humiliated. The
"stars and bars" have been trailed in the dust; the flag of the Union
waves from the principal buildings in the fallen city. Verily, the
Memphians have eaten dirt.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 4th inst. a lurid glare rising above the
woods that separated us from Fort Pillow betokened the evacuation and 
destruction of the last but one of the defences of the Confederates on
the banks of the Mississippi. Captain Phelps, commanding the flag-ship
of the flotilla, immediately started on a reconnaissance round
Craighead Point, whence an uninterrupted view of the works could be
obtained, and found the flames to proceed from the burning of
gun-carriages, cotton embrasures, and barrack-sheds. Beauregard's
retreat from Corinth had induced the abandonment of Fort Pillow; and,
to make its occupation as profitless as possible to the Federals, the
torch had been applied to what remained. Nothing could be seen of the
Confederate fleet; and the presumption was they had fallen back to
Memphis, seventy-five miles below, the result proving this surmise to
be correct. As it would have been extremely unwise to land a force
with the risk of magazines exploding, it was determined to delay the
occupation till the following morning, and accordingly at daylight on
the 5th the flotilla weighed anchor, and steamed down to the still
smoking line of earthworks. The position of Fort Pillow struck me as
being remarkably strong both naturally and artificially. Situated on a
bold rise known as the First Chickasaw Bluff, it commanded the bend in
the river, which here has its channel immediately under the cliff, and
within a hundred yards of the guns, most of which would direct a
plunging fire on passing vessels. The works were in three tiers, and
composed of a water battery over a quarter of a mile in length, a
series of strong redoubts midway up the face of the bluff, and an upper
series partially hidden by dense foliage. A semicircular line of
rifle-pits, running three miles back in the country, protected the
garrison from attack in the rear. The Confederates had evidently been
engaged for some time removing their guns, as we found only twelve
remaining when we landed. A portion of these had been spiked, some had
been burst, and others had been dismounted; but still some half dozen might
prove serviceable to the Federalists. There is no doubt the
Southerners had had at least fifty guns in position; but, finding they
would sooner or later have to evacuate, they had gradually removed the
greater number of their pieces to strengthen the batteries being
constructed at Vicksburg, the last barrier closing the Mississippi to
the Federalists. By the time this letter appears in print the "Father
of Waters" will pursue his course uninterrupted by cannon from his
source to the Gulf of Mexico, and Vicksburg, the final stand-point of
the Confederates, will have been wrenched from them by Davis and
Farragut.</p>

<p>Remaining at Fort Pillow but time enough to make arrangements 
for holding it, the flotilla, consisting of five gun-boats,
accompanied by the transports, steamed down the river for Memphis. Now I
realised to the fullest extent the barbarous and wanton destruction of
property of which the Secessionists are guilty. Whenever we approached
a plantation on either the Tennessee or the Arkansas shore we were
certain to see a column of smoke rising in the neighbourhood,
indicating the burning of cotton, or else the water would be covered by
floating masses cast from the bank into the stream. Passing within
hailing distance of one of these plantations, and noticing some men
engaged in efforts to save a quantity that had become entangled with
some drifting timber, I called and asked them by whose orders their
property had been destroyed. Their reply was, "They say it's by order
of the Government, but there aint been no such thing in this <hi rend="italic">dog-goned</hi> country for over a
year." I then asked if they were glad to see the stars and stripes
back again, and the answer was, "We guess we are, mighty so;" and, in
token of this feeling being pretty general, numbers came down through
the woods and cheered us as we passed along. We learned that the
Southern fleet had preceded us but a few hours, and that their crews
had landed and searched every plantation they came to for cotton,
which they either burnt or threw into the river, despite the
protestations of the owners. One of their transports we overtook and
captured while engaged in this vandalism, but the more responsible of
those who were on board landed and escaped across the country before
we took possession of her. That night, at ten o'clock, we anchored
three miles above Memphis, concealed from the town by a cluster of
islands known to Mississippi boatmen as "Paddy's Hen and Chickens."
The next day, June 6, was to decide the fate of the city, perhaps of
the Federal flotilla, for, undoubtedly, there would be a great passage
of arms between the rival fleets, the crews of one fighting beneath
the eyes of their Southern belles and inspired to deeds of valour by
their presence. An hour after the flotilla had come to its moorings a
dead silence reigned on every vessel: many that night said "God save
us!" and others cried "Amen!"</p>

<p> At five a.m. on the morrow the signal was flying from the Benton
(flag-ship) to cast off, and at half-past five we rounded the point
that separated us from Memphis, and came in full view of the city and
the Confederate fleet, eight in number, drawn up in line across the
river to dispute our progress. Nothing daunted, the five national
gun-boats steadily pressed forward; and as we drew nearer we saw that
the bluff in front of the town was covered by a dense crowd assembled
to witness the gladiatorial display. The glorious sun of June rose
resplendent, shedding its golden rays on spire and roof, and bathing
the brown old Mississippi in a flood of light that made its opaque
waters fairly sparkle. The parti-coloured masses on the cliff dressed
in their gay summer clothing gave to the scene a festive appearance
strangely at variance with the stern reality of war about to be
enacted in their presence. But I was soon called from the
contemplation of the spectators in the amphitheatre tiers to the
arena itself, in which I was somewhat of an actor, for the first note
of defiance had been roared from the throat of a 64-pounder, and the
shot scattered the water up all round. In a few minutes all the
vessels on each side were engaged, and the firing became general, the
Southern boats slowly falling back while we continued advancing. Two
vessels under a full head of steam came from our rear and passed
swiftly through our line, each seeking an antagonist in the
Confederate fleet. They mounted no guns, and had but a crew of twelve
riflemen stationed behind a massive loopholed bulkhead. A few weeks
since they were ordinary river steamers, but, having been thoroughly
strengthened and protected by massive timbers and a solid iron-tipped
prow placed on each, it was determined to try them as rams. On they
sped unharmed by the storm of shot and shell which was rained upon
them. The first, the Queen of the West, made for the Beauregard, and,
as the latter sheared off to avoid the blow, she ran foul of the
General Price, one of her consorts, completely tearing the starboard
wheel off the latter and compelling her to run to the Arkansas shore
in a sinking condition, where she was abandoned by her crew. The
General Bragg now came up to the assistance of the Beauregard and
struck the Queen of the West on her port paddle-box, crushing it in,
but in turn got a huge rent in her port bow. In the mean time the
other Federal ram, the Monarch, bore down towards the General Lovell,
and, striking her amidships, cut her down to the water's edge, and in
three minutes afterwards she sunk in one hundred feet of water, taking
with her most of her crew. Thus two of the Confederate boats were
disposed of, six only being left for the five national vessels to
contend with, the rams retiring from the fight. A shot from the Benton,
fired by Captain Phelps, struck the Beauregard in her boilers, and she
went down, giving Commodore Davis, who made the most humane efforts,
barely time to save those on board her. The Jeff Thompson was set on
fire by a shell from a Federal boat, and, being run ashore, blew up
shortly after she was abandoned; the General Bragg also was struck by
a shell and her cotton bulkheads ignited, but the crew of the Benton,
who boarded her, succeeded in extinguishing the fire. To sum up the
whole affair, one Confederate vessel alone escaped--the General Van
Dorn; three were destroyed, and four were captured after a running
fight of one hour and a half.</p>

<p>Next mail will bring you an account of the occupation of Memphis, the
feeling of the people, and their conduct under Federal rule. At
present I can do no more than send you this brief letter, as my time
has been taken up with sketching.

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Ladies.</hi>--I confess that in the States I have
sometimes been driven to think that chivalry has been carried too
far--that there is an attempt to make women think more of the rights
of their womanhood than is needful. There are ladies' doors at hotels,
and ladies' drawing-rooms, ladies' sides on the ferry-boats, and
ladies' windows at the post-office for the delivery of letters (which,
by-the-by, is an atrocious institution, as anybody may learn who will
look at the advertisements called personal in some of the New York
papers). Why should not young ladies have their letters sent to their
houses instead of getting them at a private window? The post-office
clerks can tell stories about these ladies' windows. But at every turn
it is necessary to make separate provision for ladies. From all this
it comes to pass that the baker's daughter looks down from a great
height on her papa, and by no means thinks her brother good enough for
her associate. Nature, the great restorer, comes in and teaches her to
fall in love with the butcher's son. Thus the evil is mitigated; but I
cannot but wish that the young woman should not see herself
denominated a lady so often and should receive fewer lessons as to the
extent of her privileges. I would save her, if I could, from working
at the oven; I would give to her bread and meat earned by her father's
care and her brother's sweat; but, when she has received these good
things, I would have her proud of the one and by no means ashamed of
the other.--<hi rend="italic">Trollope.</hi></p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Prospects of California</hi>.&#x2014;The Californians are anticipating the time when they shall be
compelled to turn their attention to other pursuits than gold
digging. Placer mining in some parts of California has already ceased
to be profitable for white men. In 1852 gold diggers earned 10 dollars
per day, and in 1862 they are obliged to be contented with 2&#xBD;
dollars. It is estimated that if the fruitfulness of the gold mines
continues to decrease in the same ratio as it has done for the last
ten years, in 1872 no white men will be found at work in the gold
mines. American writers express an opinion that in a few years
California will get rich by carrying timber to China. The latter
country, having been densely populated for ages, is bare of timber; and
the monster forests of California could furnish that product for
centuries to come, and also supply the fleets of steamers which will be
required for the Chinese rivers. "The Chinese," says a Californian
paper, "are alive to the benefits of river steamers, and to the
advantages which shipments on European vessels give in safety and
certainty of insurance. Before the pirates made the voyages of the
junks almost impossible the Chinese merchant calculated to lose one
venture in three. He now avoids the risk by freighting in foreign
bottoms. The opening of the rivers will call for the construction of a
fleet of light-draught steamers, which California can supply. We have
faith that the trade may be ours if efforts be made to secure it; and
that as our mills increase and labour diminishes in value we may make
steady shipments of lumber to China's great valley, and, if we will,
that the return vessels may be loaded with a product which will give
employment to Californian looms and spindles. Our northern forests
will resound with cheerful industry and our shipyards give forth the
productions of ingenious labour. Youthful California and Oregon will
spare to aged China the surplus of their forests for the produce of
her plains, made bare of wood by the wants of centuries of a dense
population."</p></div2>

wish for conversation; nay, even a disinclination to converse. In the
Western States I do not think that I was ever addressed first by an
American sitting next to me at table. Indeed, I never held any
conversation at a public table in the West. I have sat in the same
room with men for hours and have not had a word spoken to me. I have
done my very best to break through this ice, and have always failed. A
West American man is not a talking man. He will sit for hours over a
stove with a cigar in his month, and his hat over his eyes, chewing the
cud of reflection. A dozen will sit together in the same way, and
there shall not be a dozen words spoken between them in an hour. With
the women one's chance at conversation is still worse. It seemed as
though the cares of the world had been too much for them, and that all
talking, except business (demands, for instance, on the servants for
pickles for their children), had gone by the board. They were
generally hard, dry, and melancholy. I am speaking, of course, of aged
females--from five-and-twenty perhaps to thirty, and who had long since
given up the amusements and levities of life. I very soon abandoned
any attempt at drawing a word from these ancient mothers of families;
but not the less did I ponder in my mind over the circumstances of

<p>There are no Hungarians in the Confederate army, while the number
in the Union service is large. It is said that General Fremont, while
at the West, sent his secret dispatches to Washington in Magyar, which
was as good as cipher, since no person in the Confederate service
knows the tongue.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Anglo-Saxon we
have newspapers to the 11th and telegrams vi&#xE0; Cape Race to the
14th instant.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Belligerent Operations.</hi></p>

<p>The grand army on the James River, reinforced by the
corps-d'arm&#xE9;e under General Burnside, is safely intrenched
around Harrison's Landing, about twenty-seven miles from
Richmond. Beyond a slight skirmish on the 3rd, there had been no
fighting since the 1st instant. It is admitted that all idea of
immediate advance upon the Confederate capital is abandoned.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had paid a visit to the army, in order to see for
himself if any changes were needed in the command of the army. He held
a private conference with General M'Clellan for half an hour, and then
proceeded to visit the line of intrenchments. He was welcomed with
great enthusiasm by the troops. He addressed to them some encouraging
words, denying that they had been beaten, and expressing his
confidence that they would not give up without going into Richmond. He
declared his confidence in the army and its commanders.</p>

<p>The special correspondents of the journals acknowledge that the
retreat of the army was attended with the greatest peril, and that
nothing but the superiority of the Federals in artillery saved
them. The Confederates marched up to the mouth of the guns with utter
recklessness of life. Had they placed 50,000 men south of White Oak
Swamp they could have divided the Federals into two parts, and
annihilated them. The Confederate journals complain that they were
outgeneralled at this point. The Federal loss in killed, wounded, and
missing is set down at 30,000. It is probable that the Confederates
suffered as severely. The report that their General, Magruder, was
captured, and General Jackson killed, was unfounded.</p>

<p>A Federal transport conveying supplies up the James River was fired
into by the Confederate batteries below Harrison's Landing, and was
obliged to run ashore to escape being sunk. Captain Wilkes, late of
the San Jacinto, had been appointed to the command of the James River
flotilla.</p>

<p>The British steamer Modern Greece, whilst attempting to run the
blockade at Wilmington, North Carolina, was run aground by the
blockading fleet, who hauled off on the opening of the fort on
them. She had 100 tons of powder on board, but the fort succeeded in
sinking her so as to wet the powder and prevent her explosion by the
Federal shells. Her passengers and crew were saved. It was believed
that a large portion of her cargo would also be saved.</p>

<p>Vicksburg still held out against the Federals, although the city 
had suffered a ten-days' bombardment, and been on fire several times.</p>

<p>The army of occupation in the Valley of the Mississippi has met
with two reverses. A large body of Confederates has captured
Murfreesborough, a town thirty-two miles south of Nashville, and taken
one Federal regiment prisoners. Despatches from Mobile say that Baton
Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, had been recaptured, and 1500 Federal
prisoners had been taken.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>In consequence of the late battles, Confederate stock rose from 93
to 97. The wheat and oat crop in these States is a failure.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>General Scott had been summoned to Washington and had quarters assigned him at the War Department.</p>

<p>The Treasury Note Bill as finally passed, allows the issue of
150,000,000 dols., of which 50,000,000 dols. are reserved as a banking
fund to secure the payment of temporary deposits, leaving 100,000,000
dols. for circulation. Of these 35,000,000 dols. may be issued in
small notes of one, two, and three dollars denomination.</p>

<p>Congress is debating the propriety of employing negroes in the
military service of the nation, and has passed a bill authorising the
President to make arrangements with foreign Governments, especially
with Denmark, for the colonisation of captured negroes.</p>

<p>A meeting of the members of Congress for the Border States had been
held to consider the President's emancipation scheme. The <hi rend="italic">New York Post</hi> says that the majority oppose the
scheme and will decline to accept the proposal.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Northern States.</hi></p>

<p>The great question of the hour is the means of raising the 300,000
men called for by the President at the instance of eighteen
Governors. Great efforts were being made by public meetings, patriotic
addresses, gubernatorial proclamations, &#x0026;c., to promote
volunteering. The Common Council of Buffalo had appropriated 80,000
dollars to raise a new regiment in that city, giving 75 dollars bounty
to each recruit in addition the 40 dollars granted by the Federal
Government. Other cities had offered 100 dols. The Mayor of New York in
has proclamation urges the people to enlist, not only to put down the
rebellion but to repel with becoming spirit the first approach of
foreign intervention.</p>

<p>The eighty-sixth anniversary of the Independence of the nation was
celebrated with less &#xE9;clat and with greater gloom and
depression of spirits than in any previous year during the course of
their history.</p><pb n="95"/>

<p>Gold has varied from 15 to 17 per cent premium. Silver commands 8
per cent premium; and even copper cents are 2 to 3 per cent above
par. The greatest inconvenience existed among retail dealers for small
change, and "shinplasters" were freely used. Some journals advocated
the use of postage-stamps for small change.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JULY 26,</hi> 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">For</hi> the time, at all events, the tide
seems to have turned. Details of the six days of fighting near
Richmond have arrived, and it will need something more than a speech
from Mr. Lincoln to convince the world that the Federals were not, in
his delightful language, "whipped." The whipping was certainly
administered with immense vigour and disastrous effect. That General
M'Clellan is now safe, under the protection of the gun-boats, which
have again proved of the utmost value in the strangest campaign on
record, is probably true; but the contrast between the vauntful
promises and the almost piteous reference to the last date at which
guns were lost is very significant. The largest statements were set
flying, to the effect that at least five armies, numbering 130,000
men, were all marching on Richmond; but we have heard all this kind of
thing before. The best thing that can be said is that, apart from the
bombast necessary for civil consumption, General M'Clellan has a right
to take credit for having got a portion of his army well out of a
terrible scrape; but it is insulting common sense to talk of a rapid
flight over seventeen miles, the loss of a very large number of guns,
and the abandoning dead and wounded, as anything but a defeat of the
most signal character; and it is not a healthy sign that a Government
is afraid to trust a people with the truth, and compels a brave
soldier to frame addresses in the style of Napoleon at Astley's
Amphitheatre. The slaughter of those days should have made men grave
and truthful; it is almost impossible to realise the fact that some
five and twenty thousand men were either killed or <hi rend="italic">hors de combat</hi>, but so the estimates, now permitted
to ooze out, represent the case to be. A new success gained by the
Confederates in the South is reported, and we learn that B&#xE2;ton Rouge
has fallen into their hands, with 1500 prisoners. The ruffian Butler
may begin to tremble in New Orleans. A battle with Halleck was thought
to be impending. Finally, all reports certify that "an uneasy feeling
as to both military and political matters prevails," and this is a
vague formula, yet one which has often preceded news of strange
disruptions in the Old World.</p>

<p>In our own Parliament silence has been at last broken upon the
American question, and in a debate, raised by Mr. Lindsay, the House
was asked to consider whether England ought to interfere. But we are
glad to say that the Commons preserved the self-control which has so
creditably characterised their proceedings in reference to
America. No speaker of first-class position took part in the debate
except Lord Palmerston, who spoke only to deprecate discussion and to
urge that so difficult and important a subject should be left to the
Government. There was little that fell from any of the debaters that
should annoy either Northerns or Southrons, at least such among them
as are aware that Mr. Whiteside is rather liked for a vituperation
which disturbs the dullness of the House, but is nobody when heads
are counted. The other speakers displayed the most laudable moderation
of language.</p></div2>

<p>We give below a View (from a by sketch by Eyre Crowe) of the
High-street, Richmond, towards which city public attention is now
naturally directed. This street straggles picturesquely down one side
of a hill and up another. The stores are of a strictly utilitarian
character, with nothing pretentious about them. The poles which extend
throughout the breadth of the flagway are intended, during the summer
heats, to protect the lounger from the blistering sun. By far the
greatest object of curiosity to European visitors in Richmond is the
little street running at right angles with High-street, and on the
left-hand side. It is called Wall-street: in it the sales of negroes
take place. From this narrow little passage have issued entire armies
of "likely hands" after being sold, as they have gone southwards to
the plantations. Thousands, however, are fixtures in Richmond
itself. They throng the streets, carting away large tobacco barrels; or
else grin good-humouredly at the door of the American Hotel, the
principal one of the town, which is also in the High-street. As in
every town in America, the telegraphic wires festoon the street, and
send sensation headings to the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Times</hi>
or the<hi rend="italic"> Richmond Enquirer.</hi> Doubtless they have
ere this flashed to these offices news of more than ordinary import, and
the High-street is thronged with soldiery seldom seen there in more
peaceful times.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">Washington, July 4.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> thunder of the cannon before Richmond
reached me in ominous echoes down the valley of the Mississippi. It
was whispered the roar of the Confederate guns rose more defiant than
that of the Federal. Rumours of great battles on the Chickahominy came
hourly to Memphis through Southern sources, and, though nothing was
reliable, yet it was evident the fight for the championship had
commenced. I had always felt that my place was before Richmond, and
your readers are aware of the cause of my absence from that central
point of interest. What I proposed, Mr. Stanton was not disposed
should be. However, the manifold blunders and petty jealousies of this
official are now producing such grievous results that his downfall is
almost certain, and if his removal in disgrace from a position which
he has proved himself totally unfit for be considered a satisfaction
to those he has injured, why then I, among others, am morally assured
of that amount of vengeance, at least. With the probability that his
succesor may be more liberal towards English correspondents, and less
narrow-minded generally, I have hastened back from the West and await
the change in the Administration, which may, perhaps, enable me at the
eleventh hour to avail myself of General M'Clellan's invitation to
join his head quarters on the James River.</p>

<p>I want your readers to understand one thing, and that is, that I
write my impressions from day to day, and if I am misled at the time
it is by force of circumstances for which I can scarcely be held
responsible; but I can clear up and correct afterwards when I find I
have been deceived. In a former letter I mentioned that crowds of
refugees from Memphis sought the protection of the Federal gun-boats
as they lay off Fort Pillow, and that I learnt from many of them that
there was a strong Union element in that city which only awaited the
appearance of the flotilla to declare itself. I have since found this
not to be the case, and I may say positively that there is more
bitterness of feeling evinced towards the North by the Memphians than
I ever saw displayed by the Italians to the Austrians. If the entire
South is actuated by the same sentiments breathed by the people of
south-western Tennessee and Mississippi, why, then I declare the
reconstruction of the Union impossible; and, though the North by
superior power and resources may eventually conquer the South, she can
never hold her in any other way than that which binds Venetia to the
Tedeschi. Your readers must understand that I never saw anything of
Southern people until I landed at Memphis. A "peculiar institution" of
theirs had prejudiced me somewhat against them, and I believed from
all I heard that the Secession movement was but skin deep after all,
and that the people would willingly return to their allegiance to the
Government of the United States if the old flag were carried to their
midst and the leaders of the rebellion removed from among them. I have
been astounded at the unanimity displayed by all on the one subject of
separation. If there be a dissentient here and there, he is a man who
has Northern interests, and most frequently he is a German, a
sojourner among a strange people. If the South had not been unanimous,
how could the movements of their Generals have been kept so secret,
and yet all transpiring within the Federal camps be known in the ranks
of the Secessionists? If they had had traitors to their cause in their
midst, would Corinth have been evacuated in the face of Halleck's
immense army without that General being made aware of what was
transpiring within three miles of him? Would "Stonewall" Jackson have
been allowed to perform that brilliant movement which enabled him to
attack M'Clellan's right and form a junction with Lee, while the
Federal commanders, over a hundred miles away in the Shenandoah Valley,
were trembling in their jackboots at the idea of his momentarily
attacking them? I say again, I believe the South to be unanimous, and
with this belief my ideas have notably changed as to the future. In
Memphis and its immediate neighbourhood I made it my business to mix
with all classes and test their loyalty or disloyalty, and, though the
stars and stripes floated from the public buildings, and the supremacy
of the Federal Government had been asserted by the Federal arms, yet I
found but one minute drop of Union oil to pour upon the troubled ocean
of Secession: all were clamouring for separation. If, then, such are
the sentiments of the entire South, and defeat does not bring them
nearer to the Union, what is to be the result of all this bloodshed? A
conquered people, writhing in the chains that bind them to their
conquerors, seeking every fresh opportunity for outbreak. The civilised
world will shortly demand that this wholesale massacre shall cease,
and that the temperate counsels of European Governments shall take the
place of unskilful Generals, who, while sacrificing the lives of
thousands of brave men and deluging this vast continent with their
blood, approach no nearer to a solution, but widen the gulf which
separates the combatants and embitter the hatred which is daily
growing fiercer.</p>

<p>As I have stated at the opening of this letter, my purpose in
returning to Washington is, if possible, to reach the army on the
James River. Very bad news for the Federalists will reach you by this
mail, already, I suppose, anticipated by telegraph, and, though it is
evidently the wish to make the best of it, I must caution you against
believing in a victory where there was a defeat. At present I know but
little about what has latterly transpired in front of Richmond, at
least I am scarcely sufficiently posted to go into the matter, and
must refer you to the general news. Of one thing there is no doubt,
that M'Clellan has been forced to retreat seventeen miles with
frightful loss, and yet hypocritical journalists here chant a "Te
Deum," and pronounce the movement to have been a masterly piece of
strategy. I have still one or two more Mississippi Sketches to send
you, and with them I will write more fully and from the best authority
as to the actual condition of matters with the army of the Potomac. I
have hopes of getting on the spot myself, and shall leave no effort
untried to reach the James River, but how I am to achieve my purpose
unless the Minister of War relents, I scarcely know.  F. V.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Our Illustrations.</hi></p>

<p>Two Engravings in connection with the operations of the Federal
flotilla on the Mississippi, from Sketches by our Special Artist,
forwarded by the previous mail, are given in this week's Impression at
page 105.</p>

<p>The first shows the position of the flotilla before Fort Pillow
shortly before the evacuation of that fort by the Confederates. In a
letter written in a transport off Fort Pillow, on the 31st of May
last, our Special Artist writes as follows respecting the subject of
this Illustration :--"Our mortars have been pegging away at Fort
Pillow for the last day or two without intermission, and we
occasionally get a shell in return. Unfortunately, the Federalists
cannot well ascertain the effect of their fire, as all they can see of
the fort or its position is simply the rise of the bluff on which it
is situated above the bend in the river. The Sketch I send will give a
tolerable idea of the relative positions. The national mortar-rafts
are placed against the Arkansas shore, immediately under the bank, and
half a mile of dense forest lies between them and the winding bed of
the river which flows by the fort. The shells are thrown over the
trees, the range being calculated by a daily reconnaissance sent to
observe the effect of the bombardment; but this reconnaissance is not
always successful, for the woods are often filled by Confederate
scouts, on which occasions a free fight takes place, knocking
everything else on the head."</p>

<p>As regards the second Engraving, which shows Colonel Fitch and the
46th Indiana Volunteers taking at the point of the bayonet the battery
of Fort St. Charles, we have the following particulars:--On the 13th
of June four of the gun-boats from the flotilla in front of Memphis
were dispatched to the White River, Arkansas, 185 miles below, to
clear out the cotton-burners and to endeavour to communicate with
Curtis. The expedition, on its way up the White River, met with a
battery mounted on a bluff, and the gun-boats immediately engaged, the
Mound City leading. Unfortunately, a 42-pound shot from the breastwork
entered the casemates of the Mound City and burst her steam-drum,
scalding 125 persons. The poor fellows, writhing with agony, jumped
through the ports into the river, and were there, while shrieking for
help, shot down by the rebels. Colonel Fitch, who was on board one of
the Union transports, immediately landed, and carried the works at the
point of the bayonet. The success of the Union forces was complete,
and the Southern artillerymen were shot at their guns.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Cincinnati Daily Times</hi>, in its number

remembered, is one of the few London journals that has taken an

<p>By the Canadian mail-steamer Hibernian we have telegrams vi&#xE2; Cape Race to the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The position of the army of the Potomac remained unchanged. It had
been reinforced from General Hunter's command, now inactive on the
coast of South Carolina. The Federal fleet in James River comprises an
immense number of vessels. There are nearly 600 transports and
war-steamers between Newport News and Harrison's Bar, besides almost
innumerable small craft, among which are 100 to 200 canal-boats. The
gun-boats number from 20 to 25. From Richmond we learn that the
obstructions in the river had been considerably weakened by the recent
freshets; that Fort Darling had been greatly strengthened and the
batteries iron-clad; that a division of the Confederate army had
crossed the river on a pontoon-bridge to assist in its defence against
any land force. A gun-boat on the plan of the Merrimac was rapidly
approaching completion at Richmond, though great difficulty was
experienced in obtaining iron for her armour.</p>

<p>President Davis had issued an address to the army congratulating
them "on the series of brilliant victories" which they had lately won,
which had forced the foe, "despite his reinforcements, to seek shelter
under the cover of his gun-boats, where he now lies cowering before the
army so lately divided and threatened with entire subjugation."
General Lee also congratulates the army upon relieving Richmond from a
state of siege, and claims to have captured fifty-three pieces of
artillery in the late engagement.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Shenandoah all is quiet. Labourers are wanted
to gather the bountiful harvests. General Pope had issued a general
order that the army would subsist on the country in which he was about
to carry on operations.</p>

<p>The West has been prolific of desultory contests. Murfreesborough
has been taken and evacuated. The Federal General Duffield was
mortally wounded, and the Confederate General Twiggs killed in the
affair. The south-west is overrun with guerrillas. The Confederates
have captured Cynthiana and Henderson, in Kentucky, and have even
crossed the Ohio River, for the first time since the war commenced,
and seized the river town of Newbourg, in the free State of
Indiana. In view of these events the Governor of Ohio had called out
volunteers for thirty days, to resist incursions from Kentucky.</p>

<p>Vicksburg still holds out, and the canal which is to divert the
course of the river, and which is being dug by negroes in the Federal
service, advances towards completion. A Confederate ram had arrived at
Vicksburg, and, after inflicting considerable damage upon the Federal
fleet, had anchored under cover of the Confederate batteries.</p>

<p>The story that B&#xE2;ton Rouge had been recaptured by the Confederates is without foundation in fact.</p>

<p>General Curtis, by forced marches, had safely arrived at Helena,
Arkansas, after worsting the Confederates in several small
engagements. The Confederate General Price has crossed the Mississippi
into Arkansas to co-operate against General Curtis.</p>


<p>The British steamer Ann was discovered by a United States' frigate
and gun-boat under the guns of Fort Morgan, Mobile Bay, unloading arms
and gunpowder. The former engaged the fort, and the latter succeeded
in cutting the British vessel out. Her cargo consisted of war
material, tea, coffee, pepper, and the like.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>Congress adjourned on the 17th ult. During the Session it has
appropriated 800,000,000 dols., including 560,000,000 dols. for the
Army and 100,000,000 dols. for the Navy.</p>

<p>Congress had passed the Militia Bill, authorising the President to
employ negroes for camp service, or any military or naval service for
which they are competent; also to accept 100,000 volunteers for nine
months, with the usual bounty.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had signed the Confiscation Bill, with amendments
that the provisions of the bill should not apply to acts of rebels
done previous to the passing of the bill, and that the confiscation
is to be only during the lifetime of offenders.</p>

<p>The President had signed an Act for issuing postage and other
stamps for currency, and forbidding banks or corporations to issue
bills for less than one dollar.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives had postponed the Senate Bill for the
admission of Western Virginia until the next Session of Congress by a
vote of 63 to 53.</p>

<p>In the Senate, Mr. Chandler denounced M'Clellan's tactics,
declaring that tens of thousands of men were killed in the swamps of
the Chickahominy, and that 158,000 men were sent to M'Clellan previous
to the battles before Richmond.</p>

<p>The Border States members had issued a majority report opposing
President Lincoln's emancipation scheme, and a minority report favouring the scheme.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Northern States.</hi></p>

<p>The press and public meetings continue to stir up popular
enthusiasm for the war. Nevertheless, the recruits do not come forward
in the large numbers needed by the Government. The State of Vermont
had been the first to raise a regiment under the new call and dispatch
it to the seat of war.</p>

<p>The Great Eastern was anchored in Flushing Bay, on the northern
coast of Long Island, about eight miles east of New York City. The New
York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says, "The experiment of bringing
her through the Race and up Long Island Sound to her anchorage in
Flushing Bay was a complete success. She was brought to her anchorage
with as much ease and dispatch as any ordinary vessel would have
been." The passengers were conveyed to the city by steamers expressly
provided by the agents. Before leaving, the passengers presented a
complimentary letter and resolutions to Captain Paton. She approached
New York by this route instead of by the Hudson River, because her
heavy cargo rendered her incapable of entering by the latter
inlet.</p>

<p>Gold has risen to twenty per cent, and silver to fifteen per cent
premium. The city of Newark, in order to meet the outcry for small
change, has issued corporation notes for small amounts varying from
ten cents. (5d.) to fifty. The strike of the grain shovellers of New
York against the floating grain elevators, is a serious check to the
most flourishing department of the export trade of the States.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">California.</hi></p>

<p>On the 10th ult. there was a grand torchlight procession in San
Francisco in honour of the passage of the Pacific Railroad Bill. Many
houses were illuminated.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, AUGUST</hi> 2, 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">American</hi> news is more important than
exciting. In the midst of a mass of detail of a complex character
comes the announcement that Congress enables the President to employ
the Negro in any military or naval service for which he may be
qualified. If, therefore, a "contraband" of warlike genius should
arise, there should be nothing to prevent his becoming an officer of
the United States Army or Navy, and leading the Whites into
action. Surely Africa is winning in the great game, whatever may be
the ill fortune of Europe and America. We further learn that the
unwise act--to give it no harsher name--by which the breach between
North and South is rendered irreparable--the act of confiscation, and
imposition of the penalty of death, in the case of every Confederate
who shall be in arms after the middle of September--has not been
vetoed by the President, but has received his assent, with the
amendment that it shall not be an<hi rend="italic"> ex post facto</hi>
law. That Mr. Lincoln dared not repudiate a measure at which his
judgment revolted shows the greatly increasing power of the
Republican section in the North, as opposed to the Democrats, and that
it is clear that the idea of reconstructing the Union has been
renounced by the former. The currency question exerts its fatal power
in the North, as elsewhere, and various shifts are being employed to
mitigate inconvenience, postage and other stamps being made legal
tender. Congress had adjourned, having during the Session appropriated
800,000,000 dollars. Thomas Moore wrote, in the Prince Regent's
days--</p>

<p rend="center">When mighty Belshazzar brims high in the hall</p>
 <p rend="center">His cup full of <hi rend="italic">go&#xFB;t</hi>
to the Gaul's overthrow,</p>
<p rend="center">Lo, "Eight Hundred Millions" I write on the wall,</p>
<p rend="center">And the cup falls to earth and the gout to his
toe.</p>
<p> We may believe that still more crippling results will he found to
have followed Jonathan's indulgence in the luxury of
extravagance. The military news represents the Confederates as having
gained a number of small but exhilarating successes, and of having
effected some movements of a really "strategic" kind, and which will
be found to have value in the later part of the campaign. M'Clellan
had been reinforced, and in one column of an American journal we read
"Enormous Enthusiasm for Little Mac," while in the report of the
proceedings in the Senate we find him denounced in no measured terms,
and charged with having lost men by tens of thousands in the
swamps. At last the North, which has had several pseudo-Napoleons, has
found one general capable of treading in the steps of
Bonaparte.--General Pope has proclaimed that "war is to support war,"
that the Federal armies are to live upon the resources of the country in which
operations may be carried on. Every successive act of the Federals
further destroys the fiction that they are not dealing with
"belligerents." Recruiting is said to proceed very slowly, in spite
of the large sums offered by the Governments. The Confederate General
at Richmond congratulates the army there upon having delivered that
city from a state of siege, and states that fifty-three Federal guns
have been taken in the recent engagements. For what strategic purpose
it was desired that these should be in the hands of the enemy General
M'Clellan will explain at his leisure; the Duke of Wellington was
rather particular upon this subject, and we remember seeing him
touchingly earnest upon one occasion in explaining to the Lords that
in an affair to which reference had been made two or three guns were
supposed to have been lost, but he would not move until they had been
brought in. We are justified in bringing in the name of a single
Wellington where so many Napoleons are set up. Lastly, the prompt act
of the English authorities in seizing a Confederate vessel that had
violated the Queen's orders had received tolerably courteous
recognition at New York, and this is something in the present temper
of the North.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">PLAN OF THE SEAT OF WAR IN EASTERN VIRGINIA.</hi>.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Plan which we present to our readers
on page 125 covers an area of about 20,000 square miles, and includes
a large portion of the country between the Blue Ridge on the west and
Chesapeake Bay on the east, between the Potomac on the north and James
River on the south, which has been the theatre of the best-contested
conflicts on land and sea between the Federals and Confederates. East
of the Chesapeake are the two peninsular counties of Virginia and a
portion of the "eastern shore" section of Maryland. West of it lies a
nobly-watered country, including portions of Maryland, the district of
Columbia, and the "tide-water" section of Virginia. The rivers falling
into the Chesapeake from the west are successively from north to south,
the Patuxent, Potomac, Rappahannock, York (formed by the confluence of
the Pamunkey and Maltapony), and, lastly, the James. In the north-west
corner of the plan are to be seen the cities of Washington,
Georgetown, and Alexandria. The country intersected by the York and
James Rivers abounds in points of interest. At the extremity of the
peninsula formed by those two rivers are Fort Monroe and
Hampton. Nearly opposite, on the Elizabeth River, are Norfolk and the
Gosport Navy-yard. On the York River, near its embouchure, is the
little port of Yorktown, famous for the surrender of Lord Cornwallis to
the American forces in 1781. It<pb n="129"/> recently fell into the
hands of the Federals, when the Confederates fell back on
Richmond. Jamestown, a little village on the north bank of the James
River, thirty-two miles from its mouth, was the seat of the first
permanent English colony in America (in 1607). A few miles above
Jamestown the Chickahominy discharges itself into the James. About
halfway between Richmond and the mouth of the Chickahominy lies the
hilly country, where M'Clellan's army is now stationed. Still higher
up, and only seven miles below Richmond, is Fort Darling, where the
course of the river is obstructed to prevent the passage of the
Federal gun-boats. Richmond itself is situated on the north bank of
the James, about 100 miles from its mouth. Directly opposite to
Richmond are its suburbs of Manchester and Spring Hill, which are
connected with the city by three bridges. Five lines of railroad
radiate from the capital of Virginia. The Richmond and York River
Railroad, which in times of peace connected the city with the
aforesaid river, was the line by which M'Clellan supplied his army,
and on which his head-quarters at White House were situated until his
recent change of front and base of operations. His right wing at one
time was extended so far as to rest on the Virginia Central Railway, a
line running north from Richmond, just north of the point where it
crosses the Chickahominy. This river and the White Oak Swamp, across
which his army retreated, lie between the Richmond and York River
Railway and the James River. On the south bank of this river, nearly
opposite to Turkey Bend, is City Point, where the Federal flotilla is
now anchored. This is also the point where the Appomattox flows into
the James.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Atrocious Act Of Piracy</hi>.--The secretary at Lloyd's has
received from the Board of Trade a copy of a despatch from the British
Consul at Malaga relative to an atrocious act of piracy committed near
the Spanish coast. A short time ago the American barque Reindeer,
Captain J. N. Hewlett, master, received a cargo of salt at Cette, for
New York. At one o'clock on the morning of the 9th ult. she had
proceeded on her homeward voyage to a point about thirty miles to the
south-east of Malaga. There two Spanish seamen belonging to the crew
surprised and murdered the second mate, the carpenter, the cook, and
another seaman, wounded the master, the chief mate, and two
others. They plundered the ship of some 400 dols. in specie, and a
watch. They stove one of the boats, and absconded with the other one,
after setting fire to the vessel fore and aft. At eight am. the
American ship Minstrel, and the English brig Susannah hove in sight,
and Captain Hewlett and the survivors of his crew were transhipped on
board the Minstrel. At six p.m. they abandoned the Reindeer, and very
soon afterwards she became completely enveloped in flames. Two of the
victims were British subjects. The second mate, John H. Hanson, was a
native of Liverpool; and a seaman, Henry Frost Jones, was a native of
Cardiff. Both of them were murdered in their berths; the bodies were
left on board and went down with the burning ship. The boat in which
the pirates quitted the Reindeer has been found on the beach a few
miles to the eastward of Malaga.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">United States</hi>.</p>

<p>The only exhibitors of cotton goods from the United States are
Messrs.  Gardner, Brewer, and Co., of Boston, Massachusetts (96). The
goods shown are a very superior quality of fine shirtings, which were
certainly not produced a few years ago in any part of the
States. These goods arrived very late, and have not been included in
the awards of the jury, which they certainly ought to have been if in
time for examination.</p>

<p>Having noticed, as far as the space at our disposal will admit, all
the countries which exhibit cotton goods worthy of special
examination, we must conclude with simply recording the interesting
fact that the jury of class 18 has awarded three prize medals to
exhibitors of raw cotton grown in New South Wales, and the same number
to exhibitors of the same material grown in Queensland. One exhibitor
in each colony is distinguished in the awards--Mr. J. B. Nowlan (41),
New South Wales, and Mr. W. Cairncross (18), Queensland--as exhibiting
"splendid cotton," and the others as being of "good and useful
qualities." This is a distinct proof that the British colonies of the
Southern Hemisphere can produce raw cotton which will satisfy the
fastidious taste of an international jury of cotton manufacturers, and
this is saying a great deal, when the prejudice in favour of American
cotton, and, unfortunately, nothing but American cotton, is taken into
account.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> the shade of one of those vigorous
Englishmen who laid the foundations of our manufacturing prosperity--a
Watt or an Arkwright, for instance--could just now revisit the scenes
he so dearly loved, how inexplicable would seem to him the distress of
our artisans! How difficult it would be to explain to him why
such a calamity should have happened, or, if it had happened, why it
was not speedily put an end to. Let us but review in thought the kind
of questions and answers that would have to be exchanged. "Has the
cotton crop suddenly failed through a universal blight?" No; but we
can't get our usual supply on account of a civil war in
America."--What, then, are you dependent mainly upon that one source?"
"Yes!"--"And were the merchants and manufacturers never warned
of the danger of thus relying?" "Often; but the warnings were
never heeded."--"Then, of course, there was no special cause of fear
inherent in the nature of the case?" "Indeed but there was; all the
cotton from the Southern States of America was slave-grown, and there
were probably few Englishmen who did not believe that some day or
other the system must come to the ground with a crash."</p>

<p>And, if such a glimpse of the causes of our trouble would seem
necessarily surprising to the shade of a truehearted and strong-souled
Englishman of an earlier era, how would he look on the present aspect
of affairs, and on the future prospects of remedy they open? Suppose
we pursue a little further our imaginary dialogue, which, as will be
seen, deals with no imaginary facts:<hi rend="italic"> they</hi>,
unhappily, are but too real. "How long may it be since this war broke
out?" "It is now in its second year."--"And what has been done by you
all in England to put an end to so terrible a state of things?" "By
us? 0, we have read, the papers daily, to see how the war was going
on, and to judge how it was likely to end."--"And now?" "Why, now we
incline to think that it grows more intense than ever, and that its
termination is more hopelessly distant."--"And you really mean to say
that neither your Parliament, nor your manufacturers, nor your cotton
operatives have done or are doing anything effectual to ensure the
reopening of all these deserted or half-deserted<pb n="150"/> mills,
and the relief of millions of your people from so unnatural a
suffering?" "Why, you see, the difficulties of action are great."--"You
mean that cotton grows but in few places, and is not of easy culture?"
"No; next to corn there is no product at once so valuable and so
widely dispersed over the globe as cotton, or that grows so
spontaneously where it grows at all. The hand of Providence seems to
be everywhere raising up for the human family in boundless profusion
the corn wherewith to make the bread we eat, and the cotton wherewith
to make the clothes we wear."--" Perhaps, then, it is England's
peculiar misfortune to be shut out from the cotton-fields of the
world?" "On the contrary, she has, in no less than four out of five of
the great divisions of the world--Asia, Africa, America, and
Australia--cotton-fields of almost limitless extent."--"Well, I can
but venture on two or three questions more (so strangely confusing
does the whole business appear). Has England any high motives of state
for not encouraging the growth of this all-important plant in her own
dominions?" "She has every conceivable motive and temptation for doing
the very reverse. To take a single instance. We now hold India by the
tenure of a European force seventy thousand strong; if we could but
substitute for that tenure the right of taking from her three millions
of cotton-bales for English use, and of repaying her by an equal
amount of manufactured goods for the use of the people of India, we
might at once recall half our soldiery: these delicate cotton
filaments would doubtless prove of greater tenacity for holding nation
to nation than the strongest sword ever forged."--"Well, but England
is, perhaps, very poor just now, unable to do more than take care of
these her half-famished children who have been so suddenly stricken
down?" "Excuse my smile in answer; we are so troubled with a plethora
of gold that the Bank of England discounts at two and a half per cent;
and capital, not knowing what else to do with itself, is flowing away,
first to Turkey, then to Morocco, next to Egypt, then to Italy, then
to Portugal, and seems, indeed, piteously begging foreign countries of
all kinds to take pity on its destitute state."--"One guess more, and
I have done. Has there fallen upon the world an evil period when
industrial skill and energy are paralysed, and no one has the heart to
move in an unaccustomed way?" "Come and look at our International
Exhibition, and there you will have your answer! You will see that
never before in all human history were the elements of industrial
prosperity and material grandeur so rife as now."</p>

<p>We will not any longer trespass upon the reader's indulgence by
taking an indirect mode of trying to bring home to him the very
peculiar position in which we now as a nation stand; but we should
like to take such a reader with us to the building just mentioned,
that we might pursue with him the interesting question that forms our
theme to-day. We should like him to see with his own eyes the samples
of cotton that are there being exhibited, to study their quality, and
to mark how wide are the geographical boundaries of the world's
cotton-field. We should desire him to dwell especially on the samples
from India, and to note from how many different parts of that splendid
country we can reckon supplies. No less than sixteen prize medals have
been awarded for Indian cotton, and the value thus suggested is still
more directly confirmed by the market prices that have been affixed to
them by the commissioners. The lowest price is 11d. per lb.; the
highest (from Penang), 2s.; and the average 12&#xBD;d. We would ask
him to remember that India has already, in a single year (1861), sent
us very nearly a third of the three million bales that we require; that
the most popular of all the South American kinds, the New Orleans,
grows perfectly in India from American seed; and that the best judges
calculate that, even at present, the annual growth of the country
amounts to something like six million bales, or twice the entire
amount of our demand. Of course, India needs cotton for herself; and
cannot, under any circumstances, be expected without preparation to
spare very largely from her ordinary stock; but still she can spare, no
doubt, far more than we seem likely to get from her under existing
arrangements.</p>

<p>From the study of the Indian cotton samples we would have the
visitor go to that of the samples from Jamaica, which prove that our
West Indian colonies can grow as good cotton, and as cheaply, by free
negro labour, as it has been grown in America by slaves. He will find
among them samples of almost fabulous value, varying from 2s. 8d. to
3s. 6d. per lb. And it is estimated that Jamaica alone could furnish
half a million bales yearly. So again we shall find in the exhibition
Barbadoes cotton, worth 2s. 10d. a pound; Bermuda, worth 11&#xBD;d.;
Ceylon, worth from l0d. to 1s. 9d.; and Trinidad, worth 2s. 11d. Or
yet again to pass to the samples from quite other parts of the world,
but still keeping within our own dominions (where it is our
fellow-subjects who ask us to trade with them by exchanging cotton for
manufactures), there is Natal, which sends us samples ranging in value
from l2&#xBD;d. to 2s., and reminds us of the inexhaustible
cotton-fields of Africa on which Dr. Livingstone has been so wisely
eloquent. The plant is indigenous there, and grows to wondrous
profusion. What a blessing alike to us and to the benighted Africans
would it not be if we could teach their chiefs to employ their spare
population in growing cotton at home as free men instead of selling
them away to foreign lands to be there similarly engaged as slaves!
And then, too, there is that recent but most wonderful development of
British blood and enterprise, the Australian community, which promises
to be able before long to give us all the wool and all the cotton that
even our two colossal manufactures demand. Take Queensland for
instance, where the best South American cotton-seed flourishes in
perfection, both the Sea Island kind, and the less valuable short
staples. The local Government of the colony appears to be quite aware
of the value of the prospect. It has offered a bonus of ten acres of
land for every bale of a certain size of Sea Island cotton grown in
the colony. Here then, is a field from which, if no other existed in
the world, all our necessities might be supplied in a few years. And
as to the value of the cotton it produces, let us look to the
practical opinions of the commissioners, who have affixed the almost
incredible price of 3s. 6d. per pound to Mr. Rode's sample; and there
are other samples similarly distinguished by the very high price of
3s. 3d.</p>

<p>Not one bale of cotton, therefore, do we need that cannot be well
and wisely grown--that is to say, economically--in our own
colonies. But it is quite certain that we shall not be allowed to
depend upon them exclusively. Here is Brazil with its samples of equal
but moderate excellence, averaging in value about 1s., sending us
already--in 1861--nearly 100,000 bales. Here is Egypt, with its Pacha
claiming and obtaining a prize for his cotton, valued at 1s. 8d., and
telling us, through the lips of its excellent Viceroy, that whereas
last year it sent us about the same quantity as Brazil, we may expect
next year at least one-half as much more. Syria is trying, and with
success, both Egyptian and American seed. France, too, is joining in
the struggle, as the possessor of Algeria; where the very finest
possible kinds of cotton are being grown, and of a commercial value
that the exhibition commissioners mark by numerous prizes (eighteen)
for samples varying in worth from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 6d. per lb. Turkey,
too, claims to be able to grow and sell cotton of a useful kind; so
does Russia, her old antagonist; so does Portugal; and so do most of
the South American Republics. But there is one nation that we should
have hardly expected to find thinking of cotton just now, when arms
appear to be so much more attractive to it, and possibly in its view
so necessary--that is Italy. It is said, and apparently with truth,
that she could give us next year 100,000 bales by merely devoting to
the culture some of those southern districts that are now lying waste
and breeding miasma instead of expanding their surplus heat and
moisture in cotton. The prize samples of Italian cotton in the
exhibition are valued generally at about 1s. 1&#xBD;d. per lb.</p>

<p>Why, then, are we in our present difficulty, and how are we to get
out of it? These are the questions we ought to ask, and not rest till
a clear and sufficing answer has been given to them. Looking
practically at the position, we shall find that we must distinguish
between the countries that cannot immediately give us an increased
supply and those that can; and the part of true wisdom surely must be
to take immediate help from the one class while urging the other on
to give us permanent relief. It is probable that India is this only
country that can be relied on to mitigate our present strait. And why
do we not seek the co-operation of that country? The answer must be,
because Indian views of political--which means national--economy do not
agree with the views of English manufacturers. The latter appear to
think it very good economy to say to the millions of Hindostan, "Be
you quite ready to 'supply,' but don't rely upon us to 'demand.' No
wonder the people of India decline the flattering invitation."</p>

<p>"Last May," says Mr. Saunders, the commissioner appointed by the
late Lord Canning to inquire into the growth of cotton in India, "I
was in the cotton districts; and, as the period for sowing cotton was
approaching, I asked some of the growers if they intended to increase
the cultivation of cotton, as the price had risen so high in England?
They replied, 'Sahib, we hear of high prices, but there are no buyers
or contractors here. When the Sahibs want indigo, or sugar, or
oilseeds, they come among us and build kothees (factories), make
advances and contracts; but in the case of cotton, which is said to be
so much wanted, there is not a single Sahib buyer or contractor. No;
there is something wrong. We won't grow more than we want for
ourselves or our native merchants.' The manufacturer steadily declines
to send out his agent; the Indian landholder as steadily declines to
increase his cotton cultivation. The latter is no sufferer, for he
continues to grow his indigo, sugar, cereals, &#x0026;c.; and will grow
cotton when a local demand arises for it, and is quite indifferent
whether that demand comes in one year, or in ten years, or at all. And
what is the position of the former? A ruined trade and a starving
population around him. One-tenth of the funds required to support that
population during the cessation of the cotton manufacture would
suffice to establish agencies in Berar and the North-West Provinces:
that would increase in one season the present production by a million
of bales, and, in process of time, would produce sufficient cotton to
supply all the wants of England."</p>

<p>Here is the whole problem for us in a nutshell. We must send out
agents with the money in their hands to buy, for we shall not get
Indian cotton sent here on speculation to sell. The Hindoos know as
well as we do the possible contingency of a sudden influx of American
cotton, and they are determined that if it does take place it shall
not be at their cost. And however we may turn or twist the matter
about, whether we say it is or is not in accordance with the teachings
of economical science, we shall have to come back to the same original
starting-point, Do we need cotton from India? then we must fetch it at
our own risk. We can get it at a very moderate price; but we must pay
that price, not ask the Indians to speculate on getting probably a
much larger, possibly a much smaller, one. Many modes of action have
been proposed, such as a differential duty for a time (say three
years) in favour of free-grown cotton, which would cause American
slave-grown cotton to be taxed if it came into competition during the
three years. It has also been suggested that Government may itself buy
the cotton required for a brief period, taking precautions against
anything beyond a temporary interference; or it may guarantee a five
per cent dividend to cotton companies for a similarly short period
while they undertake the work and risk. Or, lastly, our manufacturers
themselves might do all that is requisite by a combination amongst
their own members to buy or bargain for all the cotton they require
for a year or two, and so share the gain or the loss that might accrue
from their cotton-buying speculation. If any of these modes are
adopted, the end in view can clearly be obtained; and it would be
desirable to adopt the one that best harmonises with the ordinary
course of business and with teachings of economists. But, if all of them
are refused or neglected, we must make up our minds to continue to
suffer with constantly-increasing severity for an indefinite term;
with all the risks of political agitation; while no longer able to
attribute our distress to a sudden and unforeseen cause, and still
less to any lack of the Divine bounty.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Norwegian we have
telegrams, vi&#xE2; Cape Race, until the 28th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Halleck, late Commander of the forces in the Department of
the Mississippi valley, has been officially appointed General-in-Chief
to command all the land forces of the United States. The appointment
has been favourably received by the Northern public, who have lost
their former faith in General M'Clellan.</p>

<p>The President had issued a proclamation authorising the military
commanders to seize and use for the Federal army all property, real
and personal, in the rebel States which might be necessary for
military purposes. The military and naval officers are ordered to
employ as many negroes for labourers as can be advantageously used for
military and naval purposes, and pay them wages.</p>

<p>General Pope had issued orders to the army under his command to
seize all houses, mules, and stores in their vicinity not absolutely
needed by the inhabitants of the surrounding country. All the
inhabitants must take the oath of allegiance or be driven south. The
inhabitants who break the oath will be shot.</p>

<p>The same General reports that a calvary expedition had, at his
directions, made a descent upon the Virginia Central Railroad at
Beaver Dam Creek, thirty-five miles from Richmond. They destroyed the
railroad and telegraph lines for several miles, burned up the
d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t, which contained 40,000 rounds of musket
ammunition, 100 barrels of flour, and other valuable property. The
Confederate General Jackson was in or near Gordonsville, and a
collision between his army and that of General Pope was daily
expected.</p>

<p>From the army of the Potomac we learn nothing beyond that the
health of the army is improving, and that General M'Clellan has
expelled all civilians, including newspaper correspondents, from the
camp.</p>

<p>General Dix has been appointed commissioner to negotiate with the
Confederates for a general exchange of prisoners. Thus the full
belligerent rights of the Confederates are at length conceded.</p>

<p>It is officially reported that the Federal loss in the recent
battles before Richmond was 16,000 men.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Johnston's report of the battle of Seven
Pines has appeared. He mentions his own weak state from wounds
received. He charges upon General Huger's delay the escape from
destruction of an entire Federal corps. He claims to have captured on
that occasion ten pieces of artillery, 6000 muskets, one garrison
flag, and four regimental colours, besides a large quantity of tents
and camp equipage. The Confederate loss was 4283.</p>

<p>In Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri, the activity of the guerrilla
bands increases. A plot to rise and seize the city had been discovered
in St. Louis. The loyal Governor had called out the State militia and
forbidden the sale of arms. Many of the British subjects in St. Louis
had thronged the Consul's office in that city, to get certificates of
nationality, protecting them from the conscription. Here they had been
attacked by a mob. A detachment of the provost guard was ordered out
and the outbreak suppressed.</p>

<p>The Federal Commander Farragut had abandoned the siege of
Vicksburg, and left, with his flotilla, for New Orleans.</p>

<p>In view of General Butler's proceedings at New Orleans, the
President had issued an order prohibiting military commanders from
exacting an oath of allegiance from aliens, and absolving such aliens
as had taken such an oath from its obligations. In all cases where an
alien is deprived of his liberty, a full account of the circumstances
must be sent to the War Department, for the consideration of the
Department of the State.</p>

<p>At the request of the British Ambassador, conveyed by the
Commander of her Majesty's sloop-of-war Rinaldo, General Butler had
consented to recognise Mr. George Coppell as Acting British Consul,
upon the latter's apologising for an offensive expression which he had
made use of respecting General Butler's orders.</p>

<p>The British steamer Adela had been captured by a Federal vessel off
Abaco, one of the Bahamas. The British steamer Tubal Cain had been
captured off Charleston. The British schooner Star of the East had
been seized by the Custom House officials in New York, and the case
referred to the Secretary of the Treasury. She took out a clearance
for Long Cay, in the Bahamas, and it was asserted her cargo consisted
of goods well adapted for the use of the Confederates.</p>

<p>Recruiting for the Federal army still languished. The
municipalities and the State Legislatures continued to offer very high
bounties, but the attractions of the harvest-field seemed greater than
those of the battle-field to the mass of the labouring
classes. General Meagher had addressed the Irish of New York with the
view of stimulating them to enlist. The Governor of Ohio had announced
that if the quota of that State was not ready in forty days he should
resort to draughting.</p>

 <p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">THE EMANCIPATION QUESTION.</hi></p>

 <p>President Lincoln's appeal to the Border State members is very
 urgent in recommending them to accept his proposals. He says, that
 "if the war continues long the institution in your States will be
 extinguished by mere friction and abrasion--by the mere incidents of
 war." In repudiating General Hunter's proclamation, he says, "I gave
 dissatisfaction, if not offence, to many whose support I cannot
 afford to lose. And this is not the end of it. The pressure in this
 direction is still upon me, and is increasing."</p>

<p>Twenty of the Border State members have replied that Congress had
not voted any sum for remuneration, and that they could not consider
the proposition in its impalpable form. When a formal proposition was
made, backed by the necessary appropriations, they might submit it to
their States, but the debt it would involve appalled them by its
magnitude. They had contributed their full share to the support of the
war, and they did not see why they should be called upon to make
sacrifices greater than the people of other States, who were not more
loyal. They would under no circumstances consent to the dissolution of
the Union, neither would they ever consent to join the Southern
Confederacy, as they could not place their security in the the custody
of an association which had incorporated in its organic law the seeds
of its own destruction. They deny that their refusal to adopt
emancipation had prolonged the war. They would not, under any
circumstances, become parties to General Hunter's policy of letting
loose the slaves on the Southern people.</p>

<p>The minority of the Border State members, eight in number, respond favourably:--</p>

 <q>We are the more emboldened to assume this position from the
 fact, now become history, that the leaders of the Southern rebellion
 have offered to abolish slavery among them as a condition to foreign
 intervention in favour of their independence as a nation. If they can
 give up slavery to destroy the Union, we can surely ask our people to
 consider the question of emancipation to save the Union.</q>

<p>Several committees, composed of the Mayor and many of the leading
merchants and lawyers of New York, have passed resolutions declaring
that no qualified unionism should be longer permitted, and that it is
far better every rebel should perish than that one more loyal man
should die. The committee therefore earnestly call upon the President
immediately to issue an emancipation proclamation, "This," they say,
"will diminish the rebel army by calling many rebel officers and men
to the defence of their homes. The Free States and the whole civilised
world will applaud the emancipation proclamation."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">MISCELLANEOUS</hi>.</p>
<p> The crops are generally good throughout the North, but there is a
scarcity of labourers. One railroad company advertised in New York for
fifty labourers and did not receive any applications. This is
attributable to the drain caused by the war.</p>

<p>The Danish Government had agreed to take as apprentices all negroes
captured on board slave vessels by the Federal cruisers.</p>

<p>It is reported from Key West that a Federal gun-boat had captured a
large barque on the Coast of Cuba, just as she was unloading her last
boat of slaves. She was at Key West under charge of a prize crew. One
hundred thousand dollars were found on board.</p>

<p>Gold had fallen; but still commanded 17 per cent. premium.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">OBITUARY</hi>.</p>

<p>Ex-President Van Buren died on his estate at Kinderbrook, in the
State of New York, on the 24th ult., at the advanced age of
seventy-eight. He was President of the United States from March 4,
1837, to March 4, 1841, being the successor of General Jackson and the
predecessor of General Harrison and Mr. Tyler, the last of whom died
lately at Richmond. It was during his presidency that the Canadian
rebellion took place. He was elected to his office by the Democratic
party, which, however, failed to re-elect him in 1840, when he was
defeated by the Whig candidate, General Harrison. In 1848 he was the
candidate of the Free-soil Democrats. To this schism in the Democratic
camp General Cass, the regular Democratic nominee, owed his defeat,
and General Taylor, the Whig candidate, his election. Since then the
deceased took no active part in American politics. His death leaves
but three surviving ex-Presidents of the United States--viz.,
Messrs. Fillmore, Pierce, said Buchanan.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">On</hi> Thursday afternoon the Commissioners
appointed by her Majesty to prorogue Parliament took their seats
shortly before two o'clock. The Commons having been summoned, the
Speaker, with a few members, appeared at the bar; and, the Royal assent
having been given to some public and private bills, the Lord
Chancellor read her Majesty's Speech, which was as follows :--....</p>

<p>...The civil war which has for some time been raging among the States
of the North American Union has unfortunately continued in unabated
intensity; and the evils with which it has been attended have not been
confined to the American continent. But her Majesty, having from the
outset determined to take no part in the contest, has seen no reason
to depart from the neutrality to which she has steadily adhered....</p>

<p>Her Majesty has given her ready assent to an Act for carrying into
effect the treaty which her Majesty has concluded with the President
of the United States for the suppression of the slave trade, and her
Majesty trusts that the co-operation of the United States' navy with
her own may go far to extinguish the desolating crime against which
that treaty is directed.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">"Great</hi> expectations" are the burden of the
American telegrams. We are also told of much "uneasiness," a word of
significance in troubled times, and one which implies an unhealthy
state of feeling as regards the authorities. It would seem that the
reluctance of the people to enlist in the armies, while the Generals
appeared to be objectless and the incidents of the war were so
disastrous, was represented as being unabated; and the President's
proclamation calling on the South to take notice of the new law which
made them liable to the penalties of treason was regarded as <hi rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi>. The intention of employing the negro
in military and naval work was very unfavourably commented upon by
many who grudge the "contraband" any of the gain of the war, but was
approved by his friends as a new recognition of his status as a man
and a brother. In spite of meetings, which are variously described as
glorious demonstrations and as utter failures, and at which
excessively tall talk had been emitted, and the most portentous
declarations had been made to the effect that it was better that
every "rebel" should perish rather than that the Union should be
broken, it appears to be sullenly admitted that the mode in which a
compromise could be brought about was really the subject for the
consideration of sensible citizens. The President was asked to
proclaim emancipation everywhere, and amiable philanthropists were
complacently viewing the possibility of adding the horrors
of servile war to those of a fratricidal contest; but we are not
informed that the President or Mr. Seward was lending a favourable
ear to the project, whatever admiration it might excite among the
Abolitionists. Assuredly, should the course in question be adopted,
its results might precipitate an interference, in the interests of
humanity, by all rulers whose subjects are sojourners in a country
which it is proposed to give up to new horrors. In presence of a
negro rising, who, for instance, could blame the Emperor of the
French for taking measures for the protection of the thousands of
Frenchmen and Frenchwomen in the South? The President was still
trying to negotiate with the Border States; but it may be that they
not only know their value, but the singular difficulty of their
position, and have no desire to be</p>
<q><lg><l>Feathered 'twixt castle wall</l>
<l>And heavy brunt of cannon ball.</l></lg></q>

<p>We are informed that the losses of the Federals during the week of
slaughter near Richmond are estimated at 16,000. The ecstatic
admiration of the Southern organs for their generals is tremendous ;
and Austerlitz, with its trio of Emperors on the field and its
awful carnage, is considered a small matter compared to the recent
engagements. The latest mail tells us to expect early news of new
battles of the utmost importance.</p></div2>

<p>An important discussion in reference to the recognition of the
Southern States was raised by a motion of Lord Stratheden for the
correspondence which had passed between Mr. Mason, the Confederate
commissioner, and the Foreign Office. The noble Lord urged strongly
that the time had come for intervention.</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcap">Russell</hi> declined to give the papers
asked for. No representative of the Southern States had been received
officially, and therefore all the correspondence which had taken place
was of an unofficial character. There was, however, a despatch which
had passed between the Government and its representative in America
which might he published hereafter. It contained a statement of the
views of the Government on the American question, and nothing had
occurred to alter their intentions since it was written. If in the
course of the recess the Government thought it desirable to take any
step, he should communicate with the great maritime Powers of Europe
before doing so. He had had no communication from any foreign Power
stating a wish for recognition of the Southern States.</p>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcap">Malmesbury</hi>, while believing
that the question of our interference was only one of time, to be
decided by the Government, hoped that when the step was taken this
country would be backed by France, Russia, and the other great
Powers. He also expressed a hope that Lord Lyons would speedily
return to Washington.</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcap">Russell</hi> said there was the most
perfect understanding with France, and he had no doubt that in any
step which might be taken Russia and the other Powers would
agree.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">England and America</hi>.--Some questions on
important matters having been put and answered, Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Seymour</hi> called attention to the conduct of the
United States in the immediate neighbourhood of Nassau, and hoped the
Government would direct vigorous remonstrances to the United States on
that subject. He also called attention to the the bonds required by
the United States from British merchants that they would not send
their goods to the Confederate States.--Lord <hi rend="smallcap">Palmerston</hi> said that, with regard to then first
question, the House must be aware that there was no country more
interested than Great Britain in the maintenance of belligerent rights
at sea. It was the undoubted right of belligerents to search merchant
vessels at sea if they had reasonable ground to suppose that they were
carrying contraband of war to an enemy. It was for the owner of the
ship taken, when brought for adjudication, to urge in defence
circumstances to show that the capture was illegal. Her Majesty's
Government were, of course, not disposed to interfere with the proper
exercise of belligerent rights by the United States; but if there
should be any abuse of those rights, that being properly shown, her
Majesty's Government would take proper steps. With regard to the
second question, it was true that bonds had been demanded from British
merchants not to send their goods to the Confederate States. Her
Majesty's Government, believing such bonds to be illegal, had made
representations on the subject.</p></div2>

to the 5th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">WAR NEWS.</hi></p>

<p>The situation in General M'Clellan's camp remains the same. His
army is suffering from scurvy and receives few reinforcements. The
movements of the enemy are kept secret from the Federals, except when
they reveal themselves on the south bank of the James River by opening
fire on the Federal shipping.</p>

<p>Seven vessels of Porter's mortar-fleet had arrived at Hampton
Roads, and five more were expected. It is supposed they will be
employed to reduce Fort Darling.</p>

<p>A new Merrimac and another ram, built at Richmond, had appeared in
the James River as far down as Turkey Bend. The Federal gun boats took
up a position in line of battle, but no engagement ensued.</p>

<p>General Pope, who is said to have 60,000 men under his command, has
been more active. He had crossed the Rapidan and captured Orange
Court-house, driving out two regiments of Confederate cavalry. His
troops continue to forage upon the farms in the Shenandoah Valley,
where the people refuse to take the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>Guerrilla bands are active in several of the Border States. A
masked battery, planted by one of these bands on the banks of the
Mississippi, 150 miles above Vicksburg, had destroyed a Federal
despatch-boat and killed several hands on another Federal river
steamer.</p>

<p>In Southern Tennessee the Federals had evacuated Grand Junction,
which had been occupied by the Confederates, together with the larger
portion of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad between Memphis and
Corinth.</p>

<p>Much sickness prevailed on board the Federal fleet before
Vicksburg. More than half the crews were unfit for duty. An
unsuccessful attempt had been made to capture the Confederate gun-boat
Arkansas, in which the Federal gun-boats Queen and Essex were
damaged. The Confederates have several rams and steamers up the Yazoo
River, near the mouth of which Vicksburg is situated.</p>

<p>Volunteers not having presented themselves in sufficient numbers,
notwithstanding the tempting pecuniary inducements held out by the
Federal State and City Governments, and by private subscriptions, the
President has found it necessary to announce that if the 300,000
volunteers were not ready by the 15th of August immediate resort would
be had to draughting from the militia. The term of service is fixed at
nine months. The President declines to accept the negro regiments as
soldiers, but will avail himself of them as labourers.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">MISCELLANEOUS.</hi></p>
<p>The Governor of Kentucky, hitherto a staunch Union man, had
convened the Legislature to consider the late action of Congress
touching slavery, and to provide for the safety of the domestic
institution in Kentucky. This proclamation is considered treasonable
in the North. It receives additional importance from the fact that
the Governor has lately made a speech denouncing the confiscation and
emancipation policy, and declaring that to save the Union it was
necessary to throw over the Abolitionists.</p>

<p>Congress in the Session just closed appropriated the enormous sum
of 913,000,000 dols., which, with the sum appropriated at the summer 
Session last year--265,000,000 dols.--amounts to 1,178,000,000 dols.
since the commencement of the war.</p>

<p>Several persons had been arrested in the streets of New York for
speaking unfavourably of the war and declaring that they could not
suffer draughting.</p>

<p>The loyal Irish Americans of St. Louis had met and drawn up
resolutions denouncing the conduct of those of their countrymen who
had appealed to British protection against the threatened
conscription.</p>

<p>Isabella Susini (ne&#xE9; Hinckley), the American prima donna, had died
after her accouchement.</p>

<p>The premium on gold had fallen to 14 &#xBD; per cent. The exports of
grain to Europe were very heavy, and the cereal crops of the present
year were superabundant.</p></div2>

<p>Despatches which had passed between the Government of this country
and that of the United States have just been published. In a despatch
to Mr. Adams, dated May 28, Mr. Seward urges the reasons why this
country should not interfere in the war in the States, and sketches
tersely and vigorously the position of affairs. This despatch was
answered, after a considerable lapse of time, by Earl Russell, who
announced that England would still preserve an impartial neutrality,
while heartily wishing for a speedy conclusion to the "unnecessary and injurious civil war."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Lord Palmerston</hi> had scarcely shaken hands
with the Speaker, in congratulation upon the end of a dull Session,
when the Premier was hurrying Yorkshirewards to shake hands with
Sheffield. An enthusiastic assemblage gathered to banquet in the
Cutler's Hall there, and to welcome the veteran champion of English
independence. The guests were the notables of the district, but the
warm feeling in favour of Lord Palmerston was shared by all classes,
and stalwart workmen pressed round him to greet him with a hearty "God
bless thee, lad!" The members for Sheffield were present, and
Mr. Roebuck availed himself of the opportunity of making "a sensation
speech," in which he vehemently adjured Lord Palmerston to recognise
the Southern Confederacy, and said that the severance of the Union
would be for the benefit of England. "No doubt of it," said no less a
personage then the Mayor of Manchester, amid loud plaudit. Sheffield
must prepare itself to receive a broadside of the heaviest abuse which
the Federal prints and orators can pour in; but it will possibly be as
harmless as the united fire from fifteen ships and seven rams that was
poured upon the Arkansas when she made her destroying way through the
Northern fleet at Vicksburg. The point will be that such a speech was
made, unchallenged, in the presence of the Premier of England, and
that it was approved by the representative of the great heart of
Liberalism. In the absence of other American news of interest, we here
add that a correspondence between Mr. Seward and Earl Russell has been
published, and it appears that at the end of May the former wrote a
long despatch placing Federal prospects in a most favourable light,
and deprecating interference, and that the Earl cautiously waited, not
seeing any necessity for prompt reply, and, when he did answer, simply
pointed out that events were indecisive--that, despite all the
provocations given by the North, we had remained impartial, and that
we intended to remain so. The Earl's despatch is calm and terse, but
it condenses the situation with too much felicity to make it exactly
pleasant reading in the North. The Bishop of Oxford's recommendation
that congregations should engage in "silent prayer" for the
restoration of peace in America has occasioned some remark; but a
clergyman named Jordan, who contends that the clergy ought to be
allowed to offer up what public prayers they please, does not
materially support his own case by intimating that he should pray for
the suppression of the "rebellion"--a course which, in the present
divided state of feeling in this country, might induce a moiety of his
flock to discontinue attendance on his ministry.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna from New York we have telegrams from Cape Race to the evening of the 12th inst.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>A reconnaissance in force was made from General M'Clellan's army to
Malvern Hill and Newmarket, within ten miles of Richmond. At the former
place two Confederate regiments and a battery were encountered, but
they fled after a slight engagement, leaving 100 prisoners. At
Newmarket the Federals retired before two Confederate brigades. The
next day the Confederates moved down in force upon Malvern Hill, and
the Federals retired on their old positions. Fifteen hundred Federals
have been thrown across the James River, preparatory, it is
conjectured, to an attack upon Fort Darling.</p>

<p>General Burnside's whole command has been transferred from Fortress
Monroe to the Potomac, where it landed at Acquia Creek, and had
advanced, by last accounts, to Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>Severe fighting had taken place in the Virginia Valley. General
Jackson, having crossed the Rapidan, was met by General Pope. A
conflict ensued about a mile and a half from Cedar Mountain. It
lasted from three o'clock till dark, with what result is not clear
from the telegrams, which give two opposite versions of it. Both
accounts agree that the Federals lost one gun, and that both parties
fell back from the battle-field, General Jackson having recrossed the
Rapidan under cover of the night.</p>

<p>General Pope's troops were committing great havoc in the Virginia
Valley. President Davis had issued a proclamation, charging him with
changing war "into indiscriminate robbery and murder." He therefore
orders, that if Pope or any commissioned officer of his command be
captured, they shall not be treated as prisoners of war, but be held
in close confinement. In the event of the murder of an unarmed
citizen of the Confederate States reprisals will be taken on a
commissioned officer of Pope's command. The above regulations are
applicable only to the commissioned officers of Pope's command.</p>

<p> From the West there is a tedious recital of guerrilla attacks and
movements of small bodies of regulars. The guerrillas have made their
appearance so far north as Missouri. The Federal General McCook had
been shot by guerrillas in Alabama while travelling in an
ambulance. The Federals devastated the neighbourhood and hanged
several of the inhabitants in retaliation for the murder of their
General.</p>

<p>The Confederate ram Arkansas has been blown up on the Mississippi,
but whether by her owners, by accident, or by her assailants is as yet
uncertain.</p>

<p>Pestilence was reported as raging in Richmond, where hundreds were
dying daily. Yellow fever was active among the Federals at Key West,
in Florida. A vessel had arrived at Boston with thirty patients on
board.</p>

<p>A new outrage on the British flag had been committed by an officer
of the Federal Navy. The British steamer Herald issued from the
harbour of Charleston with a cargo of cotton. She was chased by the
Federal steamer Adirondac to within two miles of the harbour of
Nassau, New Providence, shot and shell being thrown at her all
the way. The Herald entered Nassau in safety. The captain of
the British steamer Greyhound had an interview with the Federal
captain, and protested against the act. The matter is referred to the
Governments on either side.</p>

<p>The conscription causes much excitement. In Indiana a
secret society, numbering several thousands of adherents, has been
discovered. It aims at preventing enlistments and resisting
taxation. The consulates in the large cities are crowded with
applicants for exemption-papers. The rush of Irishmen at the British
consulate in New York was so great that the police had to clear the
office. The Secretary of War had issued an order that no citizen
liable to be draughted into the militia shall be allowed to go to a
foreign country. The Federal officials at the ports, seaboard and
frontiers, will arrest such persons, who will be taken to the nearest
military post and placed on military duty for the term of draught. The
writ of habeas corpus is suspended as to all such. On the 9th many
passengers were arrested by the police on board of the European
steamers. Some were disguised as sailors and stoutly resisted. The
Government telegraphed that these who had purchased tickets previous
to the issue of the order might proceed on their voyage. The same
system of police visits has been pursued on board the Californian
steamers. Persons liable to militia duty can only emigrate to
California by giving bonds for 1000 dollars to provide a substitute,
if draughted.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous</hi>.</p>
<p>A large war meeting had been held at Washington, at which
the President made a speech. He denied that there was any quarrel
between General M'Clellan and Secretary Stanton. He indorsed the
character of Mr. Stanton for bravery and ability, and he came forward
to take upon himself the odium of the charges made against him. At
this meeting ex-Governor Bontwell, of Massachusetts, made an abolition
speech.</p>

<p>The anniversary of the emancipation of the negroes in the British
West Indies was celebrated by the coloured people throughout the
Northern States with the usual festivities. The Irish in the large
cities have of late conducted themselves riotously towards the free
negroes. They have resisted their employment as stevedores and in
factories. A very aggravated outrage occurred in Brooklyn, where a
tobacco factory, filled with coloured women and children chiefly, was
attacked and set on fire. But for the exertions of the police in
extinguishing the flames, made while the mob were pelting them with
missiles, all the factory hands would have perished.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, apropos of Lord
Palmerston's speech on Mr. Lindsay's motion, is candid enough to tell
its readers that "the British Government deserves the praise of
having held to the obligations of neutrality under conditions such as
never before urged a people to their violation."</p>

<p>The steamer Golden Gate, which left San Francisco on the 21st
ult. for Panama, was burnt to the water's edge on the 27th ult., off
Manzanilla. When the fire was discovered she was only three miles and
a half from the shore. The steamer struck the beach soon after the
upper deck fell, and the passengers and crew jumped overboard to swim
ashore. Out of 330 persons about 100 were saved. The specie lost in
her amounted to over 1,000,000 dols.</p>
<p rend="center">Canada.</p>
<p>...The captain and crew of an American steamer have been arrested at
Toronto for inducing British soldiers to desert. The steamer had
conveyed several soldiers of the 30th Regiment to Oswego during the
previous month.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Recent</hi> movements of the American armies do
not appear to have been of an important character, but the movements
of American citizens and others, in order to escape being sent to the
Federal armies, have been very prompt and decided. The conscription
has fairly terrified the population of the North, and if Mr. Lincoln
makes up anything like the force which he demands it will be by
recourse to measures which the most despotic soldier of the Old World
has never employed, except in the extremest need. When France was
struggling against the combined exertions of indignant Europe she
raised soldiers by the means which the Federal Government uses against
a revolt at home, a revolt which was to have been put down in a given
number of days. Americans, Irish, and Germans were hurrying to the
British frontier or getting on board English ships in the hope of
avoiding the "press-gang." Government, on the other hand, was
establishing a real blockade to keep its subjects at home, and the
sternest edicts were issued for preventing this unpatriotic
exodus. Such an illustration of the popularity of the war furnishes
its own comment. In Missouri the citizens and the troops have come
into actual collision on the enrolment question, and lives have been
lost on both sides; and in Indiana a secret confederation has been
discovered--if anything can be called secret in which 15,000 men
join--for preventing enlistment and taxation, and for supporting the
South. Persons are arrested on board the steamers for California, and
permitted to depart only on giving a thousand-dollar security, in
order to provide substitutes; and in New York a provost-marshal and a
military guard are doing the work of recruiting. There has been
fighting in the Virginia Valley, and the Federals have been beaten,
with much slaughter, and have lost guns. The Confederate President has
met General Pope's marauding proclamation by an intimation that he
should not treat Pope's officers as prisoners of war, and that, if
unarmed Confederates are murdered, he will make immediate
reprisals. Pestilence is said to be ravaging Richmond; but there is no
authentic information as to the movements of the defending
army. M'Clellan is reported as <hi rend="italic">in statu
quo</hi>. Taken as a whole, the latest budget of American
news is singularly unfavourable to the North.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SITUATION IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> time seems to have come at last when
the Federal Government, slow to believe and slow to act, is prepared
to recognise the stupendous nature of the work it has commenced in
combating by force of arms the determination of the Southern States to
maintain their independence. The Northern people, impelled by passion
and not by reason--for reason would have allowed the South to go in
peace as soon as it became evident that their Southern fellow-citizens
were earnest and unanimous in their desire to secede--have hitherto
been unable to see what Englishmen, Frenchmen, Canadians, and indeed
the whole world except themselves, have perceived from the
beginning--that they must either overrun the South by fire and sword,
massacre or banish the white population and give up the plantations to
the negroes and the Northern soldiers, or consent to the
separation. Mr. Lincoln, his Cabinet, the press, the New England
population, and all the large class of contractors, sutlers, and
others, who are making rapid and scandalous fortunes out of the war,
have decided within the last few weeks that the fight has not hitherto
been fought as if the whole heart and purpose of the people and the
Government were in it, and that it is necessary to carry on
hostilities against their countrymen in as vigorous and unmerciful a
spirit as if they were foreign foes leagued for the invasion of their
soil and the destruction of their liberties. And clearly, if there is
to be a war at all, this is the only spirit by which to invoke and
command victory. But is it in the power of the Federal Government and its
partisans in the press and in the pulpit, in the army and in the
counting-house, to arouse such a feeling in the minds of the Northern
people? We doubt it. The voluntary enlistments, entreated by the
President, and sought to be expedited by bribes of bounty-money from
the Federal authorities, from the State Governments, from the
municipalities of great cities, and from the liberality of contractors
growing fat on the plunder of the army, have lamentably failed. The
President asked for three hundred thousand men, and in five weeks less
than thirty thousand offered themselves. This fact made it clear in
Washington that the war could not be carried on against a<pb n="222"/>
firmly-united and desperate people by lukewarm mercenaries, the more
especially as the mercenaries only provided one man where ten were
demanded. Consequently, the President, whose original idea was that
seventy-five thousand men would be sufficient to conquer the South and
to gather up and cement the broken fragments of the Union, awoke to
the conviction that six hundred thousand men, in addition to the
armies in the field, would be no more than adequate to the mighty work
which it is his ill-fortune to conduct. If such vast forces can be
collected by the conscription which he has ordered--a new thing among
a free people, and never before resorted to in any self-governed
nation except to repel the invasion of a foreign foe--the aggregate
armies of the North levied since the assault upon Fort Sumter until
the present day will reach the frightful number of <hi rend="italic">one million three hundred thousand men</hi>. Of the first
levies, composed wholly of volunteers, at least four hundred thousand
have either perished on the battle-field or in the pestilential swamps
of the South and South-West, been disabled by wounds and disease, or
have ingloriously deserted and slunk away, no more to be heard of. And
it is not too much to say, if the conduct of the war for the future be
neither more vigorous nor more successful than it has been in the
past, that a similar doom will await the new levy of six hundred
thousand men.</p>
<p>But will the six hundred thousand be raised? <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is the vital question of the day in America,
as well as in Europe, which looks on wondering at the suicidal
conflict. It is as yet impossible to answer the question. The
response lies in a dim but not remote future, of which no one can
lift the veil. Yet one corner of it can be partially drawn aside, and
through that corner all who choose may see one thing very distinctly;
which is, that the new army, if raised at all, will be composed mainly
of Americans, and that the Irish and Germans who, up to the recent
battles on the Chickahominy and the Pamunkey, formed so large a
portion of the Federal strength, have lost their relish for, and their
hope in, the struggle, and will persistently refuse to shed their
blood in its support. Nothing else is clear in the haze of American
politics but that one great fact; and it is one which can afford no
encouragement to the Northern leaders, whether they be civil or
military.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, there is another fact almost equally ominous of
the final issue of the strife--a fact which the Americans refuse to
admit, but which is none the less palpable on that account. In fact,
much as the North hates disunion, it hates negro emancipation still
more. New England may call lustily for the abolition of negro slavery
and the elevation of the negro race to the political status of white
men; but the Northern, the Middle, and the great Western States
repudiate the political partnership, would fight to the death against
the social equality, and would rather expel the negroes from American
soil than consent to a  manumission of slaves which would bring black
labourers from the Southern rice and cotton fields to the farms and
cities of the colder North, to reduce the wages of white
labour. Between the white population and the negroes there is an
amount of repulsion and antipathy which none but those who have lived
in or studied America can understand; so that the more loudly the
bitter philanthropists of New England insist upon converting the war
into one of abolition, the more inclined are the masses of the North
who live by their labour to look upon the war as a lamentable
mistake.</p>

<p>At this point at the present moment things appear to stand. The
South gets heated as the North grows cool. Jefferson Davis takes heart
as Abraham Lincoln loses it. The North hears the President's call for
six hundred thousand men and obeys unwillingly, while public
opinion--when bold enough to express itself--declares that one million
will not suffice for the conquest, much less the retention, of the
South. We in England, looking upon the matter dispassionately,
bystanders that survey the game from a vantage-ground denied to either
of the players, see that one section of the late ill-assorted Union
is still united as one man in favour of independence under a separate
form of government; while the other section, the only one as yet
acknowledged as a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government by the European Powers, is
divided into a dozen warring sects and factions, and redivides and
subdivides itself as the war proceeds. In the South the North has no
friends. In the North the South has many warm adherents. Democrats and
Republicans, professing both of them to love the Union above all
things, hate each other with an amount of animosity unknown to the
political struggles of the Old World, and only equalled by the
antipathies of the Gironde and the Mountain in the early days of the
French Revolution.</p>

<p>How long this useless war will continue to devastate the fairest
portions of the North American continent it is impossible to forecast;
but it is easy enough to see, from the desperation of the South, and
the mingled pride and hesitation of the North, that the issues are not
in American but in European hands. As one of the most influential and
respectable of the  Northern journals, the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi>, declares, with a strong bias against the South, "the age of long wars
has passed. The industry, the commerce, the civilisation of the world
cannot stand still for years while rival communities settle their
hostile claims by mutual slaughter."  The <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi> speaks like its London namesake, and is thoroughly right in
this respect.  It is only wrong in believing that it is in the power
of the Federal Government and the Northern people to render the war
short and decisive by pouring in upon the South legions on conscripts
numerous enough to convert the Cotton States into a wilderness.  The
thing is not to be done.  The heart of the North is not in so fiendish
an enterprise.  There are no volunteers to undertake it; and
conscripts are not to be depended upon.  And, even if they were, mercy
alike to North and South would combine with self-interest to compel
the Powers of Europe to offer their friendly mediation to end a strife
that is alike repugnant to constitutional government and scandalous to
humanity.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>Details of the sanguinary battle at Cedar Mountain have been
published. It seems to have been one of the best fought and at the
same time most fruitless engagements to which this war has given
rise. The losses were heavy on both sides.</p>

<p>General Pope's official report of the battle at Cedar Mountain
states that the loss of the Federals was 1500 killed, wounded, and
missing, 300 of whom were taken prisoners. Federal General Prince was
captured by the Confederates. Confederate General Winder was
killed.</p>

<p>The Southern journals claim the victory at Cedar Mountain, and
state that thirty commissioned officers of General Pope's army have
arrived at Richmond, where they would be imprisoned, and finally
punished as felons, until the Federal Government should cease the war
policy inaugurated by General Pope.</p>

<p>General Pope has issued an order, stating that his proclamation
directing the army to subsist on the country has been abused by
officers and men, and forbidding all to molest or disturb the property
of citizens. Acts of pillage and outrage will be punished.</p>

<p>General Fremont has again been appointed to command the first army
under General Pope.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Jackson has safely crossed the Rapidan, and
is south-west of Gordonsville with 60,000 men.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan's army is supposed to have retired from
Harrison's Landing down the Peninsula--one portion by land vi&#xE0;
Williamsburg, and another portion on transports down the James
River. Both routes of retreat were liable to an attack from the
Confederates; but it is reported that the movements have been
successfully performed.</p>

<p>The Confederate journals report that their General Breckinridge had
taken B&#xE2;ton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, on the 6th inst., after
defeating the Federal forces and capturing their camp equipage and
stores. General Breckinridge reports that the Federal General Williams
and other prominent officers were killed.</p>

<p>From Richmond papers we gather the following concerning the
destruction of the ram Arkansas:--After passing Bayou Sara, on the
Mississippi, some portion of her machinery became disabled, and she
was hauled in towards the shore for repairs.  Whilst in this position,
she was attacked by a fleet of Federal gun-boats from below. After a
stern resistance she was abandoned and blown up. The officers and crew
reached the shore in safety.</p>

<p>The accounts from Tennessee and Kentucky report a continuation of
sporadic guerrilla warfare. A Confederate General, Caswell by name, has
been assassinated, at his residence near Knoxville, by a Union
Tennessean. Three hundred houses in Memphis have been seized by the
Federals under the Confiscation Act. The Confederate General Morgan,
who claims to have taken 20 towns, 1200 prisoners, and destroyed
2,000,000 dollars' worth of property, speaks in high terms of the
valour of Colonel George St. Leger Grenfell, late of the British,
now of the Confederate, Army.</p>

<p>The Federal General Phelps had resigned his position at New
Orleans, because General Butler refused to supply arms for equipping
his negro regiments. General Butler orders them to be employed in
throwing up entrenchments, and refuses to accept General Phelps's
resignation.</p>

<p>General Butler has ordered a forced contribution of 330,000
dols. from the banks, cotton brokers, and merchants of New Orleans
for the support of the poor. The assessments are made in proportion to
the sum subscribed by the merchants for the defence of New Orleans
against the Federal Government. The forced contributions from each
firm varies from 85,000 dols. to 6 dols. Nearly two hundred firms are
assessed.</p>

<p>In some of the Northern States volunteering is progressing
favourably. Maine and Michigan have already contributed their quota,
and there will be no need to resort to draughting in those States. The
large States of New York and Ohio ask for more time, which has been
granted by the War Department. The process of conscription has
therefore been postponed until September 1, in order to give the
Northern States an opportunity of filling up their quotas by voluntary
enlistments. Foreigners who have declared their intention to become
citizens are not allowed to leave the country. Numerous emigrants
enlist on landing. The Governor of Massachusetts has ordered the
enrolment of coloured citizens among those subject to the draught.</p>

<p> A collision has occurred on the Potomac between two
transports. Eighty sick soldiers were drowned.</p>

<p>The Governor of Kentucky, in his message to the Legislature,
recommends the adoption of the Crittenden resolution as a standing
proposition for peace and the settlement of the war.</p>

<p>Mr. Cassius M. Clay, late United States' Minister to Russia, has
made a speech at Washington devoted to abuse of the English
Parliament, press, and people, and laudatory of France and Russia.</p>

<p>The municipality of New York has appropriated 1,000,000 dols. for the defence
of the harbour by gun-boats and rams.</p>

<p>A letter from Richmond, dated the 3rd inst., says :--"There is a
great deal of suffering here. Coffee sells at 3 dols. per. lb.; tea,
7 dols.; brown sugar, 75c. per lb.; eggs, per dozen; 1 dol.; milk, 1
dol. per gallon; calico, 75c. per yard; linen, 2 dols. per yard; hats,
14 dols.; boots, 25 dols. to 40 dols. per pair; shoes, 15 dols.; salt,
12c. per lb.; flour, 13 dols. per lb.; butter, 1 dol. per lb.;
writing-paper, 30 dols. per ream; potatoes, 6 dols., per bushel; any
kind of coal, 50 dols. to 75 dols.; pants, 25 dols." This scale of
prices indicates not only a great scarcity, but a great depreciation
in the paper money of the Confederate States.</p>

<p>In the North the crops of grain are heavier than in any previous
year. In wheat alone the State of Ohio has an estimated surplus for
export of 17,000,000 bushels.</p>

<p>The heat was so intense in New York and Brooklyn on the 9th and
10th inst. that upwards of fifty deaths were reported in the journals
of the two following days resulting from coup de soleil and cholera
morbus, induced by exposure to the sun.</p>

<p rend="center">Canada.</p>

<p>The Canadian Parliament has been unexpectedly summoned to meet on
the 28th of this month.</p>

<p>It was expected that the war in the neighbouring republic would
have largely increased the numbers of Europeans emigrating to Canada.
This expectation has not been realised, the increase being this year
only about six per cent compared with the season of 1861. The
emigrants arriving at Quebec up to the 15th ult. ware 14,434 against
13,587 up to the same date in 1861. The immigration at the port of New
York has fallen off in about the same proportion.</p>

<p>The immigration into Canada from the United States has, on the
other hand, exceeded anticipations. The Montreal <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> says, "Canada is at present invaded by
the Yankees; they are crossing the frontier in crowds--filling the
railway cars, thronging the steamboats. A single train brought
yesterday sixty young men from New York State. During the next ten
days Canada will receive an addition of some thousands to her
population. Many of the immigrants are mechanics and workmen, and the
majority are young men between eighteen and thirty, and therefore
liable to the first draught.</p>
<p rend="center">China.</p>
<p>A steam-boat explosion has occurred at Shanghai. The vessel which
sustained the disaster is the Union Star, which had just arrived
from California, and was on a trial trip when the accident happened.
Upwards of a dozen lives were lost, one half of whom were Americans;
in addition to which there were several persons injured.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the Jura and City of Baltimore we have journals
of the 23rd and telegrams of the 26th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The evacuation of Harrison's Landing by the army of General
M'Clellan was effected without loss or interruption. The bulk of his
army has since been removed from the peninsula of Yorktown to
Acquia Creek on the Potomac, whence it effected a junction with the
army under the command of General Pope.</p>

<p>The Confederates, on receiving information of M'Clellan's
movements, immediately marched out in full force from Richmond in
order to fall upon General Pope before reinforcements could reach
him. The latter forthwith retreated across the Rappahannock, the
Confederates following close on his rear. Repeated skirmishing and
artillery engagements took place. At Cuttle's Station the Confederates
captured a staff officer and General Pope's personal luggage, maps,
official despatches, and valuable papers relating to the campaign. The
Federals occupied Warrenton after a slight engagement. By last
accounts the Confederates held the south bank of the Rappahannock with
a line of batteries extending fifteen miles. They had attacked the
Federals and endeavoured to cross the river several times, but had
been repulsed by General Pope.</p>

<p>General Halleck had issued orders that officers and men will be
held accountable for all property taken from the enemy. Officers and
men taking private property without authority would be shot.</p>

<p>The Confederates had retreated from Lexington, Missouri, had been
defeated in Arkansas, and repulsed in an attack on Edgefield,
Tennessee; but had captured Clarksville, in the same State, and were
advancing on Fort Donnelson. They had also invaded Kentucky and
captured several towns.</p>

<p>The Negro Brigade formed by General Hunter in South Carolina had
been disbanded, in consequence of its being discountenanced by the
Administration.</p>

<p>The Federal commissioner sent to New Orleans to examine into some
of General Butler's proceedings there has reported, and recommends the
return to the Dutch and French Consuls of the specie seized by that
General, and also that a large amount of sugar and other merchandise
should be relinquished to British, Greek, and other foreign merchants in
New Orleans.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>Mr. Seward has officially announced that persons who have merely
declared their intention to become citizens, without taking the
subsequent steps necessary to complete the process of naturalisation,
are not liable to be draughted. He had also issued orders to grant
passports to persons liable to be draughted who desire to go abroad,
on their executing a bond to the United States conditional to perform
military duty or furnish a substitute.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had addressed a deputation of coloured men
urging them to co-operate with him in colonising their race in
Central America, inasmuch as there was no chance of their attaining to
a position of civil and social equality with white men owing to the
antipathy of the latter to people of their race and complexion.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic reception had been accorded to the released General
(late Colonel) Corcoran, of the 69th (Irish) Regiment, captured at the
battle of Bull Run, in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. He
everywhere stimulated his countrymen to enlist, holding out to them
the inducement that the cause of Irish independence would be
benefited by the military training they would receive under the
American flag.</p>

<p>General Meagher and Archbishop Hughes having spoken in the same
sense, enlistments have been more numerous of late, both among the
Irish and native elements of the population.</p>

<p>The new small-note and postage-stamp Federal currency was issued on
the 21st ult. Gold was at l5 &#xBD; premium.</p>

<p>The Indians in the north-west part of Minnesota, exasperated at the
non-payment of the money due to them from the Federal Government,
attacked the whites, and murdered men, women, and children, burning
all the dwelling-houses they could find. Several hundreds are said to
have been killed. A body of forty-five volunteers was cut to
pieces. The Governor of the State has ordered out the militia with
horses to the scene of action.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">President Davis's
Message.</hi></p>

<p>The Confederate Congress assembled at Richmond on the 18th ult. The
message of Mr. Davis admits "the suffering endured by some portions of
the people." The prowess of the army is spoken of as assuring the
triumph of "constitutional liberty" in the pending struggle against
"despotic usurpation." He charges the Federals with disregarding the
laws of civilised warfare:-- <q>Stern exemplary punishment must be
meted out to the murderers and felons who, disgracing the profession of
arms, seek to make public war the occasion for the commission of the
most monstrous crimes. Deeply as we regret the character of the
contest into which we are about to be forced, we must accept it as an
alternative which recent manifestations give us little hope can be
avoided. The exasperation of failure has aroused the worst passions of
our enemies. A large portion of their people, even of their clergymen,
now engage in urging an excited populace to the extreme of
ferocity.</q> He recommends the extension of the conscription law so
as to include all citizens between thirty-five and forty-five years of
age. Bills embodying his suggestions had already been introduced into
Congress--in particular, one providing that a Federal army, composed
incongruously of whites and blacks, shall not be entitled to the
privileges of war. All negroes belonging to such an army who may be
captured will be sold and their commanders hung or shot.</p>
<p rend="center">Canada.</p>
<p>Anthony Burns, who about eight years age was apprehended in
Boston, and surrendered to his master as a fugitive slave, and
afterwards purchased and emancipated by the American Abolitionists,
died at St. Catherine's on the 27th ult. At the time of his death he
was a Baptist minister. His illness was brought on by over exertion
and exposure, last winter and spring, in trying to clear the church
of which he was pastor from debt. He not only did this, but
succeeded in making some important repairs; but, when everything
seemed to prosper with him, his health failed.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">New Orleans A Hundred Years Ago.</hi>--The
River Mississippi (says the <hi rend="italic">Post Boy</hi> of June 4,
1761) is now near 1500 miles navigable, and has several rivers running
into it both from the east and west, some of which are one, two, and
some above three, hundred mi1es navigable. The land is so rich and the
soil so deep, especially in the south parts of it, that in many places
one may run a soldier's pike up to the head without meeting with a
rock or stone. Its south parts are so warm, and the land so rich, that
the French who live near the city of New Orleans, which is l50 miles
up from the mouth of that river, have planted and made good sugar
these five years last past. What an immense and extensive trade will
that city have which is the seaport (as New Orleans now is) to all
this extensive country, which is capable of producing
everything--sugar, wine, &#x0026;c.--if civilised, cultivated, and
peopled, as it may probably be in a few centuries. The Crown of
England has a right by discovery and taking possession of all this
country; and King Charles II granted it to the ancestors of the late
Dr. Cox, but they neglected to settle and people it; And Sir Francis
Drake took possession on the west side of it, as far north as lat. 42,
and a great way south of that, for Queen Elizabeth; but the English
neglected to settle it. The French came and built the city of New
Orleans fifty leagues up the river, and a fort or two about sixty
miles below the city. The city and the forts might have been easily
taken the last winter--the best time to take it in, it being so warm
there. If we had sent 2000 or 3000 men down the River Ohio into the
Mississippi, and thither, on large boats, as there is timber enough on
its banks to build them with, the English might have been in
possession of all North America (except Cape Florida and the north
part of Mexico, which belong to Spain); and our King would then have
been to possession of both the north and south passages to all that
fine country and to Canada also, and no way left for the French to
come at either of them. The French there now are, and ever will be,
enemies to the English, and have lately stirred up the Cherokees and
other Indian nations to fall upon the remote western parts of
Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia, and commit so many barbarous murders
on the English subjects as they have lately done there.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi> have another State paper from America,
in the form of a message from President Davis. It is a temperate
document, designed to encourage the South, and to promote among
strangers the belief that the Confederate interest is consolidating
and that it comprehends administrative duties. It was not to be
expected, however, that such an address should be entirely devoid of
hard words; and the most is made of the conduct of Pope and Butler,
and of the atrocities imputed to the Federals. We also learn that the
South will not tolerate the employment of negro arms in the quarrel,
but intimates that all black prisoners will be sold for what they will
bring, and that all white prisoners who have commanded them shall he
treated as felons, which, under the circumstances, may be held to mean
that they are to be hanged. The enormous prices offered for recruits
for the North, and the consideration that it is better to be paid for
soldiering than to be pressed and taken gratis, have had their effect
upon the new levy, and the materials for a fresh army are coming
in. Perhaps General M'Clellan may be intrusted with the work of
manipulating these materials--a duty for which the most malicious of
his enemies, even Mr. Stanton, cannot deny M'Clellan's fitness. The
system of espionage and arrest continued in full force, and a handsome
batch of disaffected parsons were daily sent off to prison, though a
mere instalment of those who will be incarcerated, should it be true
that Butler is to be placed as military Governor at New York. We have
no valuable information as to any other military movement than the
retreat of General M'Clellan, who is credited with having taken a leaf
from the book of the Southern leaders, and having shown himself a
master of escape. Rumours of battles are rife, and it is now clear
that the last Confederate exploit was a real success, but we are
uninformed as to the fact of there having been an important
conflict. All the avenues of intelligence from the Federal camps are
carefully closed, all reporters are sent away, and the manufacture of
guesswork correspondence, though not suppressed, is conducted under
rather disagreeable conditions. Except that some of the Roman
Catholics and some of the Irish are very loud in their appeals to the
North to go on vigorously with the war, that the leading Abolitionists
are talking unpunished treason while uninfluential men are dragged off
to gaol, and that the New York press is exhausting every form of
bluster in regard to the grand preparations that are being made, and
the necessity of utterly annihilating the South, and recolonising it,
if necessary, we have no news of interest from the Western scene of
war.</p></div2>

fellow-Christians, when an attempt should be made to arrest this
destructive conflict? We deprecate utterly all armed intervention at
all, but such as you yourselves would willingly admit on the part of
England or any European Power, in your affairs. But surely the idea of
a friendly mediation may be entertained without any derogation of your
national dignity. We beseech you to reflect that, sooner or later,
some method of peaceful adjustment must must be adopted. There are
only two alternative issues of war--either the utter extermination of
one party, or some form of accommodation and compromise between the
contending sides. None of you can wish the former. And is it not
better at once to have recourse to the latter before further blood is
shed and the feelings on both sides shall become hopelessly inflamed

<p>By the arrival of the steamers Anglo-Saxon and Hansa we have papers
of the 30th ult., and telegrams to the evening of the same day.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>The week has been an eventful one in the Valley of Virginia, although the
policy of excluding newspaper correspondents deprives us of the power
of following the movements of the opposing corps-d'arm&#xE8;e in detail.</p>

<p>On the 23rd ult. the Confederates attacked Rappahannock station,
and compelled the Federals to abandon the line of the
Rappahannock. The Federals fell back on Warrenton Junction, a
distance of ten miles, after burning the bridge over the river.</p>

<p>On the 26th the Confederates made a bold and successful dash on
Manassas Junction, in the rear of the Federal army. The Federals 
were driven out of Manassas, and lost a battery of nine guns. The 
Confederates destroyed stores which their enemies value at 500,000
dols., cut the telegraph wires, and destroyed the railroad, thus
cutting off all connection between General Pope and Washington.</p>

<p>The Confederates afterwards proceeded to Bull Bun Bridge, and drove
the Federals from that point, inflicting a heavy loss on General
Taylor's New Jersey brigade, capturing two regiments, and wounding the
General. The pursuit was followed up beyond Centreville. The pursuers'
cavalry advanced as far as Fairfax Courthouse.</p>

<p>Immediately on this being known, Generals Pope, M'Dowell, Siegel,
and Heintzelman hurried from different points to drive back the
Confederates and intercept their retreat. General M'Dowell succeeded
in interposing his corps between the forces of the enemy, who had
passed down to Manassas through Gainsville, and their main body, which
was moving down from White Plain through Thoroughfare Gap. The
Confederate General Longstreet, who had passed through the Gap, being
driven to the west side, Hooker's division came upon him in the
afternoon of the 27th at Kettle Run, and, after a sharp action,
routed him, killing and wounding 300, and capturing their camp.</p>

<p>On the 28th Pope arrived at Manassas Junction, but the Confederates
under Jackson had evacuated the place three hours before. Jackson
retreated vi&#xE2; Centreville. Six miles west of that place Jackson came
upon the divisions of M'Dowell and Siegel. The Federals report that
in this fight, which lasted until dark, the Confederates were driven
back at all points. General Pope claims to have captured from
Jackson's rear 1000 prisoners and one gun. He joined Burnside and
M'Clellan near Centreville.</p>

<p>On the 30th was fought the second battle of Bull Run. General
Pope's account of it is as follows:--
<q><p rend="right">Head-Quarters, Field of Battle,</p>
<p rend="right">Grovedown, near Gainsville, Aug. 30.</p>
<p>To Major-General Halleck, General-in-Chief at Washington.--We
fought a terrific battle here yesterday with the combined forces of
the enemy, which lasted with continuous fury from daylight until after
dark, by which time the enemy was driven from the field, which we
now occupy. Our troops are too much exhausted to push matters, but I
shall do so in the course of the morning,  as soon as Fitz-John
Porter's corps comes up from Manassas. The enemy is still in our front, but
badly used. We have no less than 8000 men killed and wounded and, from
the appearance of the field, the enemy has lost two to our one. He
stood strictly on the defensive, and every assault was made by
ourselves. Our troops have behaved splendidly. The battle was fought
on the identical battle-field of Bull Run, which greatly increased
the enthusiasm of our men. The news has just reached me from the
front that the enemy is retreating towards the mountains. I at once
pushed forward a reconnoitring party to ascertain this. We have made
great captures, but I am not yet able to form an idea of their
extent. (Signed),<hi rend="smallcap"> John Pope</hi>, Major-General
Commanding.</p></q></p>

<p> On the left, the Confederates have advanced to Leesburg within a
few miles of the Potomac. The river was then fordable at all points
above Washington.</p>
<p>In the west the events of the war are chequered.</p>

<p>The Federals had evacuated B&#xE2;ton Rouge, and captured a steamer on
the River Arkansas, laden with 500 stand of arms for General Hindman,
stationed at Little Rock. The Confederate General Morgan had
defeated 800 troops, under General Johnson, near Gallatin, in
Tennessee, capturing 300 prisoners, including Johnson himself. The
remainder of the Federals retreated to Nashville.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Federal Government is very short of
arms. There are not enough to supply the troops arriving in
Washington.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Mr. Lincoln's Defence of His
Policy.</hi></p>
<p>The President has replied to the remonstrance addressed to him by
Mr. Greeley, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>, urging him to to
proclaim the emancipation of the slaves:--
<q><p rend="right">Washington, Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Sir,--I have just read yours of the 19th, addressed to myself
through the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>. If there be in it
any statements or assumptions, I do not now and here controvert
them. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be
falsely drawn, I do not now and here argue against them. If there be
perceptible in it an impatient and dictatorial tone, I wave it in
deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always supposed to be
right.</p>
<p>As to the policy I "seem to be pursuing," as you say, I have not
meant to leave any one in doubt. I would save the Union. I would save
it the shortest way, under the Constitution. The sooner the national
authority can be restored the nearer the Union will be, "the Union as
it was." If there be those who would not save the Union unless they
could at the same time destroy slavery I do not agree with them. My
paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and it is not
either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without
freeing any slave I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing
all the slaves I would do it; and if I could do it by freeing some and
leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery and
the coloured race I do because I believe it helps to save this Union;
and what I forbear I forbear because I do not believe it would be to
save the Union. I shall do <hi rend="italic">less</hi> whenever I
shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do <hi rend="italic">more</hi> whenever I shall believe doing more will help
the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and
I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true
views. I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official
duty, and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish
that all men, everywhere, could be free.--Yours,<hi rend="smallcap"> A. LINCOLN.</hi></p></q></p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">But</hi> for General Pope's assertion that he
has gained a victory we should be inclined to believe that the
engagement between the Federals and Confederates on Aug. 29 had really
been a Union success. It would seem that after a stubborn contest on
the field of Bull Run the armies had separated, both having sustained
heavy loss, but the Federals remaining in possession of the
ground. But the gallant Pope has rendered it a matter of duty with
readers of his despatches to be cautious, and to await confirmation of
his statements when they notify, as they usually do, some brilliant
feat of arms on his part. We cannot forget that immense class of
prisoners whom he took one fine morning, and whom he must have
immediately annihilated, as none of them were ever seen in the flesh
by mortal man save himself. He reports that the Confederates were
"badly used" in this last engagement, and that he was about to proceed
to use them still worse. The New York people do not appear, if their
money market be an index to their feelings, to have been greatly
reassured by this piece of information, which the Government, after a
long suppression of all news, permitted to be issued for the
consolation of the North. We shall shortly have means of testing the
veracity of General Pope. The levy was going on, according to the
Northern prints, very satisfactorily, and it is reasonable to suppose
that the enormous bribe offered on enlistment must have produced its
effect. Meantime, the President's candid declaration to Mr.Greeley
that this is not an anti-slavery war, but that, on the contrary,
Mr. Lincoln is ready and anxious to place the slave system on the
basis most acceptable to the South, if only the Union can be
preserved, has drawn angry comment from his friends in America and in
England, and not unnaturally, for he has cut away the only ground
upon which Englishmen could be asked to take an interest in the
success of the North. His manifesto is certainly calculated to give a
lively colour to his intimation to the blacks that they would do well
to take themselves out of the Union, in which they are not, he tells
them, favourites, and towards whose white constituents they have no
particular reason to feel kindly. Many of them are, it is said,
accepting this half-friendly notice to quit. As much as possible is
being made of the Irish element, and it is evident that the Union
relies in no small degree upon the swords of Hibernian mercenaries. It
will be a novelty in history should a State be found to have gained
permanent strength by the aid of such auxiliaries.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SITUATION IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Assuming</hi> that the intelligence received at
the beginning of this week bears with it that partial correctness
which has characterised all accounts of late from the American
continent, no one in the civilised world out of Washington, and, we
should imagine, scarcely any one within that capital, will deny that
the crisis of the internecine contest is at hand. The forces of the
contending parties stand in such a position that all literally may
depend upon one battle. A brief review of the events which have
recently occurred is necessary to the elucidation and verification of
such an assertion.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that the accounts which preceded those which
were received on Monday last, and which brought intelligence down to
the 5th instant, extended to the 29th of last month, on which day,
according to a despatch written on the following morning by General
Pope, a fierce battle had been fought between his corps and a
Confederate force on the identical field of Bull Run which has become
so famous in the history of the civil war. It may be said in passing
that, like many other of General Pope's statements in the despatch in
question, this assertion is inexact, as the battle was actually fought
at six miles distance from Bull Run. This battle the Federal General
claimed as a victory, and concluded his despatch by stating that the
Confederates were retiring. They did nothing of the kind, but on the
morning of the 30th attacked General Pope's corps with what is
designated "fury," and the Federals fell back in disorder, the
Confederates rapidly pouring shot and shell into the retreating
masses. The Confederates broke the Federal centre and turned the
Federal left, and, although the latter fought with great bravery, and
Pope made great efforts to retrieve the day, at five o'clock in the
evening the left wing of his army gave way, and retreated in great
confusion, crossing Bull Run; while along the road to Centreville
artillery, infantry, cavalry, and waggons were mingled together in the
inextricable confusion of a complete rout. It is stated that the
remainder of the force retreated in tolerable order to Centreville,
where, on the following day, Pope was joined by two divisions of the
army of the Potomac. On the 1st of September General Banks, who was
said to have been cut off, also reached Centreville with the force
under his command. Here it might have been supposed that another stand
would have been made; but so imminent was the danger to Washington
from a movement of the Confederates by way of Leesburg, a few miles
further to the north-west, that Centreville was abandoned on Tuesday,
the 2nd inst., and the combined armies of Virginia and the Potomac
were massed behind the intrenchments and fortifications which have
been constructed for the defence of Washington, and, in fact, exactly
in the position they occupied when they marched out for the invasion
of the territory occupied by the Confederates. The latter are nearer
Washington than they have yet been, and in a position more favourable
for attack; for, instead of being massed around Manassas, they are in
full force at a place called Vienna, on the Upper Potomac, only twelve
miles distant from the Federal capital, and at a point where the river
is fordable at the present season of the year. In short, the situation
is completely changed; the Federals stand at bay around their chief
city and seat of government; and the Confederates, who have hitherto
had to defend Richmond against the invading movements of the Northern
forces, have it now in their power to become the aggressors in their
turn, and it probably depends on the strength of the defences of
Washington, and the chances of success by an investment of and
ultimate assault on that city, whether they do not actually become the
invaders this time.</p>
<p>While these disasters and reverses have been accumulating on the
Federal forces in Virginia, the accounts from the west and other
quarters are not more favourable to their cause. The troops of the
North had been defeated, with loss of their artillery, in Kentucky,
and had been forced to retreat to Lexington, which place, however, they
had speedily to abandon. The Federals were preparing to evacuate
Cynthiana, while from 20,000 to 30,000 Confederates occupied
Lexington. Frankfort had also been abandoned by the Federals, while
Louisville was threatened. In Tennessee there has been continued
fighting; in Louisiana the recapture of B&#xE2;ton Rouge had encouraged the
Confederates to attempt the recovery of New Orleans, which city was
menaced by Generals Breckenridge and Van Dorn, with a force variously
stated at 20,000 and 30,000 men. Thus it appears that while the
Northern party actually holds the coast line, it is but nominally
master of the Mississippi; and everywhere beyond the reach of their
naval armaments the fortune of war is adverse to the Federals. Six
months of land warfare has brought their armies back to the point from
which they started for that which was boasted to be a triumphant raid
through the enemy's country; and they have to defend Washington with
tens of thousands fewer disciplined troops than they possessed in the
spring, to conduct the defence with maimed instruments, in the shape
of beaten troops aided by new recruits, and this against an enemy
gathered at an advantageous point, of great numerical strength, and
naturally and justly flushed with success and elated by achievements
from the merit of which their worst wishers cannot detract.</p>
<p>This statement of facts--and it is just possible that they are not
all the facts--we think, justify the proposition with which we set out
in the consideration of the momentous question involved--namely, that
the crisis in the civil war in America has arrived. Of the issue of
the next encounter between desperate men defending their last
stronghold, and foes with all the prestige of victory warming and
urging them to still greater deeds, it is not easy to utter
predictions. We confess, however, that the fact of the appointment of
General M'Clellan to the chief command in Washington seems to be an
ill-omen for the Federal cause. This commander has eminently
illustrated the familiar saying which speaks of a person "going up
like a rocket and coming down like its stick." It may be that he is
really the military prodigy that his friends proclaimed him to be, and
that he has been the victim of circumstances over which he had no
control; but the fact is patent that "victory does not sit upon his
helm;" and he carries with him to his new and most important command
the disadvantages of failure, and is the very last General calculated
to restore confidence to troops who must be in the frame of mind of
all soldiers driven to intrenchments and fortifications within
which they are beleaguered. We will not more than allude to
the rumours which have been prevalent that M'Clellan is at heart a
Southerner, and by consequence a gigantic traitor, hut it is enough
for our argument to say that he is not the man who can infuse into the
army he commands the spirit which is essential to success.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Confederate Generals have shown themselves
eminently vigilant and energetic, prompt to take advantage of every
weakness or oversight or mistake of the enemy to which they have been
opposed; they have co-operated with each other with almost mechanical
exactness; and they have evidently been pursuing a plan of operations
which was probably devised by some master-mind; they have mingled
boldness with prudence, rapidity of movement with breadth of design;
and it is no secret that recent success has tended to render it
possible, and even likely, that the whole male population of the South
capable of bearing arms will be at the disposal of the Confederate
military chiefs; while it is equally well<pb n="302"/> known that
recruiting in the North is in anything but a flourishing
condition.</p>
<p>In this state of things the natural inquiry is, has not blood
enough been shed? Are those hundreds of thousands of armed men who
stand opposite to each other to mix in mortal--nay, in extreme--combat
which, if not decisive, must lead to further draughts on both
populations, to the manifest disadvantage of the North? For, in order
to supply new armies to protract a warfare already sufficiently
exhaustive, the North must suspend its whole industrial and commercial
existence, and draw out its whole male population--youthful and
middle-aged--to be literally expended like some consumable article of
common use, while those who survive only become partners in defeat,
and the broken instruments of military incompetency; and this while
the agricultural South is being tilled and cultivated by the same
labourers who have always hitherto been attached to the soil in that
character, and who are neither needed as, nor would they be permitted
to be, combatants--namely, the negro population.</p>

<p>It is at this moment that one can most fully recognise the wisdom
of that policy of non-intervention in the contest in America which
England has not only strictly observed herself but has prevailed on
France also to preserve. We now see that it was possible for the
parties to this quarrel to work it out for themselves, and by their
own action to decide the fate of the Union. If it be the destiny of
the South to become a self-constituted and self-existent Republic,
such a result will have been brought about by her own means and her
own operations alone; and, if the vexed question between the two races
who have hitherto formed together the United States is to be settled
by the establishment of two States, it will be settled at once and
for ever; but if the South had been bolstered up into success by
foreign moral intervention, far less by active and material aid from
any European Power, her title to a separate existence as a Power would
not have been duly and truly established; and the time would have come
when the North, with some show of reason on her side, might have
demanded that the issue involved between the two parties should be
submitted to the process of a new trial. This, at least, cannot be
gainsaid--that the South has vindicated her right to be considered a
State; and, looking to the situation of affairs as they stand between
the Federals and Confederates, it seems clear that the time has
arrived when the North and South can negotiate as State to State; and
there can be but few, we imagine, who will deny that now is the moment
when they ought to negotiate, upon what basis it is not for us to say,
in plain language; but it is implied in the opinion which we have
expressed under a sense of what is due to that good feeling which,
irrespective of party, we bear to that which has hitherto been the
American nation.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>On the 30th ult. the Confederates under Jackson, Longstreet, and
Ewell were reinforced by the reserve under General Lee, and resumed
the offensive. The Confederates gained the advantage, and General Pope
fell back in good order to Centreville, where he was joined by two
fresh divisions under Generals Franklin and Sumner. The loss of
Federal officers in this last battle was enormous, comprising
Brigadier-General Stevens and a long list of Colonels, among whom was
Fletcher Webster, the only surviving son of the late Daniel
Webster. The Federal left wing was driven back, thrown into confusion
by the shells of the enemy. General M'Dowell then advanced in support
and endeavoured to hold the Federal centre, but the Confederates
anticipated his movement, and Generals Siegel and M'Dowell became
enveloped by the Confederates and were outnumbered at all
points. General Siegel behaved with great bravery and his troops with
steadiness, but General M'Dowell's troops broke in panic and retreated
across Bull Run. The Federal right remained comparatively firm, and
prevented the Confederates following up their advantage. The Federal
wounded were left to the care of the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 2nd inst. General Pope evacuated Centreville, and the whole
Federal army fell back within the fortifications around Washington,
the several army corps occupying the same relative positions which
they held before their departure for the peninsula.</p>

<p>Engagements occurred on the 1st between Kearney's brigade and the
Confederates under Colonel Stewart, two miles and a half west of
Fairfax Courthouse.  The Confederates were repulsed, but the Federal
Generals Kearney and Stevens were killed.</p>

<p>The Confederates were at first massed in force at Vienna, twelve
miles from Washington, but have since mostly withdrawn.</p>

<p>A Confederate force, 5000 strong, crossed the Upper Potomac at
Point of Rocks and occupied Frederick City, in the State of Maryland.
They were enthusiastically received by the Secessionist inhabitants,
but the Unionists left the town.  They have promised to protect all
private property.</p>

<p>The Governor of Pennsylvania, fearing that the Confederates will
push into Pennsylvania and destroy the Western Central Pennsylvanian
Railroad, has forwarded large bodies of troops to the entrance of
Cumberland Valley to resist the invasion, and has called on the people
throughout the State to form volunteer organisations.  The Confederate
pickets extend from Frederick seven miles towards Hagerstown.  Large
bodies of Federal troops are being transported from Washington to the
Upper Potomac.</p>

<p>The Confederate movements in Frederick have cut off the Federal
troops at Martinsburg and Harper's Ferry.  These were attacked by a
body of Confederates and succeeded in repulsing them.</p>

<p>General Burnside evacuated Fredericksburg on the 31st ult., after
burning the Government property and the bridges, and retreated to
Acquia Creek under cover of the gun-boats on the Potomac.  He has
since evacuated Acquia Creek.</p>

<p>The Federal flotilla, after destroying all the buildings on City
Point, near Richmond, left the James River and returned to the
Potomac. Some of the gun-boats had approached within view of Washington.</p>

<p>General Pope has been relieved from the command of the army in
Virginia, and is assigned to the command in the north-west. General
M'Clellan is placed in command of what may again be termed the "grand
army of the Potomac." General M'Clellan has in his favour the opinion
of the army; on the other hand he is denounced as incompetent by
leading Republican journals.  General Pope was unpopular with the
army.</p>

<p>Secretary Stanton had resigned his position in the Cabinet. General
Halleck, the Commander-in-Chief, had been appointed his successor.</p>

<p>The New York war committee propose to raise two armies of 50,000
men each, to be commanded by Generals Fremont and Mitchel. They are to
be raised under Federal authority, but, if Government refuses them,
under some other authority.</p>

<p>General Halleck has refused to call out the New York City Militia,
asserting that they declined to remain when the danger of Washington
was more imminent than now.  All the colonels of the militia regiments
indignantly deny this statement.</p>

<p>Recruits are pouring into Washington at the rate of seven thousand
a day.  The draughting order had not yet been carried out
anywhere.</p>

<p>In the west the Federal cause is also under a cloud. The Federals
have evacuated Lexington, Cynthiana, and Frankfort, in Kentucky. The
Confederates have taken possession of the former place.  The Union
Legislature of this State had fled to Louisville, carrying with them
the State archives.</p>

<p>These movements have caused immense excitement in Cincinnati.  All
the male citizens have been called out for the defence of the city,
and all business suspended.  Martial law has been proclaimed in that
city, Covington, and Newport.  The Governor of the adjoining State of
Indiana has ordered out all citizens between nineteen and forty-five
years of age, residing in the border counties, to repel invasion.</p>

<p>Nashville, Tennessee, has also been evacuated by the Federals and
occupied by the Confederate General Bragg.</p>

<p>The Federals have fallen back from B&#xE2;ton Rouge upon New
Orleans. General Butler has called out the Free Negro militia,
organised under the Louisiana State Government. This city is
threatened by Generals Van Dorn and Breckinridge.</p>

<p>Another English steamer has been captured off Charleston.</p>

<p>In the Confederate Congress resolutions have been introduced
favouring an aggressive war, and also proposing that a proclamation be
addressed to the inhabitants of the north-western States offering to
guarantee the free navigation of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers to
their mouths if they will desist from further prosecuting the war.</p>

<p>the Confederate ram Merrimac No. 2 has been seen below Fort
Darling, going in the direction of Newport.</p>

<p>It is officially announced that whenever coupons of Federal stock
are payable in foreign countries no deduction will be made for the

deducted without regard to the residence of the owner.</p>

<p>The Governors of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode
Island are holding council in Providence, with what object is
unknown.</p>

<p>H.P. Anderson, an attach&#xE9; of the British Legation at Washington,
had arrived at Memphis and recommended all British subjects to make
declaration of their nationality within fourteen days before the
Provost-Marshal.  By this means it is hoped that British subjects will
be exempted from many of the inconveniences of the state of war.
General Sherman publishes a card saying that British subjects must

<p>The Confederates under Jackson are entering Pennsylvania.  Their
advanced guard is at Green Castle, Pennsylvania. The Governor has
called for 50,000 men to resist invasion, and has telegraphed to the
Mayor of Philadelphia to raise and forward 20,000 men without delay. The
farmers are arming, and sending the women and children away. The city of
Philadelphia has appropriated 500,000 dollars for the defence of the city
and State.</p>

<p>The Confederates are recruiting in Maryland.</p>

<p>General Lee has issued a proclamation to the people of Maryland
announcing that the Confederate army has come to liberate them from
Federal rule, and stating that it is for them to decide their destiny
without restraint. The Southern people, says the proclamation, "will
rejoice to welcome the people of Maryland, but will only welcome them
when they come of their own free will. Mr. Enoch Lowe, a Marylander,
has received the appointment of Provisional Governor of Maryland in the interest
of the Confederate States.</p>

<p>On the Potomac the Confederates occupy in force the west bank of
Seneca Creek, from its mouth on the Potomac, twenty-two miles above
Washington, to Middle Brook Mills, a line of ten miles. It is certain
that they have been driven out of Poolesville, in Maryland, by a body
of Federal cavalry. General M'Clellan has left Washington with a
Federal army, and has occupied Damascus and Hagerstown, in Western
Maryland. The former place is thirty-four miles from Washington. General
Burnside is operating in another direction.</p>

<p>The Governor of Maryland has issued an order to the citizens
calling upon them to organise and resist the invasion. Commodore
Porter's mortar fleet is off Baltimore, in a position to destroy the
city if surrendered to the Confederates. General Banks is intrusted
with the command at Washington. The Federals are surrounded at
Harper's Ferry: 1600 cavalry have escaped, but it is supposed that the
remainder of the Federal force stationed there will be compelled to
surrender. The Confederates have again advanced towards Cincinnati,
driving in the Federal pickets two miles north of Florence. General
M'Dowell has been relieved from his command and granted three week's
leave of absence. He has demanded a court of inquiry into the charges
of treason made against him.</p>

<p>Twelve hundred Confederates attacked Washington, North Carolina, on
the 6th, but were repulsed and pursued several miles. The Federal
gun-boats assisted in driving them off. One gun-boat blew up, killing
the Captain and nineteen men.</p>

<p>In the West the Confederates had advanced within five miles of
Covington, in the northern apex of Kentucky.</p>

<p>A correspondent from Port Royal, in South Carolina, announces that
the President has adopted General Hunter's policy towards the negroes,
and that five negro regiments are to be raised, armed, and uniformed
for the service of the United States, and that 50,000 in addition are
to be employed in the Quartermaster's department, nominally as
labourers, but organised into companies and uniformed.</p>

<p>President Davis had ordered a day of thanksgiving for the late
Confederate victories. A bill had been introduced into the Confederate
Congress calling upon the States for 300,000 additional
troops. General Beauregard has been appointed to command the
department of South Carolina.</p>

<p>General Pope's report of the movements of the army, from the
command of which he has lately been removed, is an extraordinary
one. He blames Generals Fitz-John Porter and Siegel for not coming to
his assistance. Of General Griffin he says that he kept his brigade off
the field of battle, though in full view of the engagement,
"spending the day in making ill-natured strictures upon the General
commanding the action in the presence of a promiscuous assemblage:"--
<q>I do not hesitate to say that if the corps of Porter had attacked
the enemy in flank on the afternoon of Friday, as he had my written
order to do, we should utterly have crushed Jackson before the forces
under Lee could have reached him. Why he did not do so I cannot
understand.</q></p>

<p>He charges that the answer of General M'Clellan to his request for
rations and forage--an answer which laid down the condition that a
cavalry escort was to be furnished by General Pope--was a mockery:--
<q>All hope of being able to maintain my position, whether victorious
or not, vanished with this letter. My cavalry was utterly broken down
by long and constant service in the pursuit of the enemy, and, bad as
they were, could not be spared from the front.</q></p>

<p>The Federal loss in artillery in the recent battles in Virginia,
was more than thirty pieces. No batteries were taken from the
Confederates.</p>
<p>On evacuating B&#xE2;ton Rouge, the Federals carried off the State
library, the State-house pictures, the statue of Washington, and a
number of contrabands.</p>

<p>Commodore Wilkes had been ordered to take command of a flying
squadron on the West India station.</p>

<p>The Cuban authorities have ordered the Confederate Steamer Oreto
away from Havannah.</p>

<p>General Fremont has accepted the offer of the New York War
Committee to raise 50,000 men; but the Secretary of War has refused to
grant permission to the War Committee to raise troops for Fremont.</p>

<p>Two hundred men have been draughted at Hartford,
Connecticut. Disturbances have occurred at Newton, Connecticut,
arising from the enforcement of the draught.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The enrolment for the draught being far advanced towards
completion, the stringent war orders in reference to arrests for
discouraging enlistments have been withdrawn. The recent restrictions
on travel have been removed.</p>

<p>The Indians in Western Minnesota had attacked Fort Ridgeley. They
were compelled to retreat after inflicting a loss of 13 killed and 47
wounded on the United States' troops. The Indians of the territory of
Dakotah were in an unsettled state, and likely to rise against the
whites.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the new tariff been in operation for five
weeks, the imports of dry goods and general merchandise at New York<pb n="327"/> are higher than at the corresponding period of 1860 and
1861. A commercial authority says:-- <q>People are consuming as many
foreign goods as ever, notwithstanding the increase in the
price. Buyers of imported goods--viz., silks, laces, French muslins,
British woollens, hardware, &#x0026;c., are now paying, in addition to the
old price, a large percentage for the new duty and another large
percentage for the premium on specie; yet, in spite of this, the
importers state that the...</q></p>
<p>The election in Maine has resulted favourably to the Republicans,
but with majorities much lower than those of last year.</p>
<p>jobbers are prepared to buy freely. Leading articles of dry goods and
general merchandise have risen 50 to 75 per cent within a year, yet
the public have scarcely curtailed their consumption in any
perceptible degree.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">California.</hi></p>
<p>The Supreme Court of the State has decided that all State taxes
must continue to be paid in gold, according to a State statute to
that effect. The law of Congress which makes the Federal notes a legal
tender for the payment of all debts is held not to apply to the case
of a tax, which is not technically a "debt." In consequence of this
decision the Federal notes are at 15 per cent discount in San
Francisco. This decision is popular in a State whose pride it has
hitherto been to have done without a representative currency of any
kind.</p>
<p>The Californians have dispatched 11,000 dols. for the relief of the
suffering poor in Ireland. The elections have gone in favour of the
Union Republicans and adversely to the Democrats.</p></div2>

<p>...From the very commencement of the American War we have kept an
accurate register of the quaint and crabbed words which have turned up
in the transatlantic vocabulary, from "stampeding" to "skedaddling,"
from "bogus" to "bunkum." The last locution, however, brought under
our notice puzzles us. An English gentleman, who is said, we know not
with what truth, to have been made the victim of a very foolish
practical joke on the steps of the Capitol at Washington, and by no
less a person than General Halleck, is described as having "wilted."
Now, what is "wilting"? Is it another form of "skedaddling," or a
variety of "stampeding"?</p></div2>

<p>A letter from New York has the following anecdote:--<q>"Among the
prisoners in Fort M'Henry there was, up to the 28th of June last, a 
Norfolk lady of fashion, Miss Susan Archer Tally, who had been
arrested in consequence of a discovery made that a coffin, which she
endeavoured to get passed through the Federal lines to Richmond,
alleging it to contain the corpse of her brother, was in reality full
of percussion-caps. The fair smuggler was forthwith put under lock and
key, and was rigorously confined to her cell, with permission,
however, to take the air on a balcony pertaining to her window, and
also an hour's exercise round the ramparts, accompanied by the officer
on duty. On her release she returned to her family, near
Norfolk."</q></p></div2>

<p rend="center">The Southern Nation and The</p>
<p rend="center">Northern Union.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Do</hi> the Southern States of America form a
nation? If identity of origin and language; if community of thought,
sentiment, feeling, passion, and interest; if pertinacity of purpose,
through good and through evil fortune; if heroism, unsurpassed in any
age, exhibited amid privations, difficulties, and dangers, of a
magnitude of which the history of the world affords few examples, and
all devoted to the one great end of national independence, constitute
a claim to the title, the South is indeed a nation,--one, homogeneous,
and indivisible.</p>
<p>Are the Northern States, which deny and resist the claims of the
South, themselves to be considered a nation? They are not of one blood
and race. The original Anglo-Saxon element by which they were pervaded
two centuries ago has been so largely diluted by a Celtic and Teutonic
admixture that the English language remains the only natural bond of
union between them. Nor is this bond so powerful as it may appear. The
Germans in all the great cities of the north and west constitute a
class apart, and imbibe few, if any, ideas from English and American
literature and modes of thought. A daily newspaper published in the
German language in the city of New York has a circulation of forty
thousand. In many parts of the great State of Pennsylvania it is
necessary that all public and official announcements should be made
both in English and in German, in order that they may be fairly
brought within the cognisance of the people. The same necessity exists
in Ohio, where German newspapers, theatres, churches, and schools rival
those of the Anglo-Saxon population in numbers, importance, and
wealth. The Irish Roman Catholics form in all the Northern and Western
States an <hi rend="italic">imperium in imperio</hi>, voting together,
under ecclesiastical guidance, for objects different from those which
actuate the Protestant and Puritanic sections of the people. In
addition to these divergences which time is more likely to aggravate
and extend than to diminish in the case of the Irish, there is no
community of sentiment or interest between the several States, or
between the parties in each State that struggle for the management of
affairs. On the great question of slavery, on which the South is a
unit, the North is divided into irreconcilable factions. The Eastern
States are bigots for protection to native industry; the Western
States either care nothing for native industry or look upon it as an
evil that prevents the due expansion of the corn trade with Great
Britain, their best friend and customer. Truly considered, the North
is no more a nation than Switzerland or Austria. It is simply a
Government and a federation, and holds together for convenience, as
Switzerland does, or by military power, as Austria, and not from
sympathy or community of political or social sentiment.</p>

<p>There is no example in history of any united, homogeneous, and
determined nation that was ever conquered by a disunited,
heterogeneous, and irresolute opponent, however greatly the latter may
have surpassed it in wealth and numbers. All experience proves that
the sentiment of nationality is the strongest and most enduring of the
many forces that urge men to war, and impel them to persist in it, in
face of danger, discouragement, and temporary defeat, until the
nationality becomes triumphant. In addition to this, it must be
remembered that the so-called rebellion of the South is consistent
with American principles and history, and that the attempt to subdue
that "rebellion" on the part of the North is illogical and
inconsistent with the Constitution on which the North itself takes its
stand as an independent country. If the North is logically right in
the war it is waging against the South it is at this moment rightfully
a portion of the British dominions, and all its Presidents, from
George Washington to Abraham Lincoln, have been rebels against legal
authority. It is nothing but physical force, illegal in its origin,
which has decided the question the other way; and it is to force not
illegal in its origin<pb n="358"/> that the South has appealed,
failing all other means to secure a separation. And the South, with
this argument to support its invincible determination, must ultimately
succeed, or human nature in America is not the same as it has proved
everywhere else in every age of the world.</p>

<p>This inherent weakness of the Northern cause has long been palpable
to all European observers of the war, but is stubbornly ignored by
Mr. Lincoln and the composite people whom it is his sad privilege to
govern. The North might obtain a glimpse of the truth if it would
seriously study one aspect of the military question which affects both
itself and the South. The Southern Government has but to declare that
the "nation" is in danger, and to demand the aid of all the
able-bodied population between certain ages to confront and overcome
that danger, and it obtains without money to pay them all the men it
requires--men who cheerfully forsake their wives and families, their
business and their estates, at the call of duty, and fight without
hope of other reward than the consciousness of patriotism. When the
North is in the same difficulty, and appeals to its people in the same
fashion, the results are lamentably different. Though it offers the
common soldier a rate of payment higher than that of a Lieutenant in
the Austrian service, though it gladly accepts foreigners fresh from
the emigrant-ship, though it piles bounty upon bounty, and offers in
some districts as much as 500 dols., or &#xA3;100 sterling, per man as an
inducement to serve even for nine months, it fails to get together the
armies for which it calls. And, worse than all, these armies, even if
obtained, would be insufficient to conquer the South if they were
thrice as numerous. The North refuses to look at this ugly symptom of
its case, and vainly hopes that by higher and still higher offers of
demoralising bounty-money i[t] may bribe a sufficient number of mercenary
adventurers to fight the great battle--which such adventurers are as
certain to lose as the love of country is a stronger incentive to
earnest warfare than the love of dollars.</p>

<p>Every day that passes proves more and more forcibly that the North
is in a dilemma. The pride of the people is so great and the authority
of the Government so small that it cannot make the first offer of
concession. According to all present appearances the war may last for
a quarter of a century--blazing up fiercely at one place and
smouldering in another; transferred from the cities to the mountains
and from the coast to the interior, but still alive, as long as a
Southern man or woman is in existence to perpetuate its
animosities. It is possible that the South, by a some crushing
victory, such as the capture of Washington, might be able to dictate a
peace; or, if its leaders were so foolish as to wish to re-establish
the Union, that they might restore it for awhile, with the South as
master, and Mr. Jefferson Davis as President in the place of
Mr. Lincoln, dispossessed by common consent for incapacity; but in
default of such a consummation, which is neither probable nor
desirable, the war threatens to outlast the present generation. If it
inflicted no evils but on the unhappy combatants themselves, shedding
their best blood, wasting their substance, devastating their fields
and cities, destroying their well-won liberties, and leaving them a
century in arrear of the world's progress, other nations might look on
with wonder, with sympathy, or with disgust, as their culture or taste
might direct; but if, in its lingering but bitter course, it is to
derange the commerce and paralyse the industry of others, and to
reduce to pauperism the thrifty and hard-working millions of people in
Europe who have done neither of the belligerents any harm, the
question must arise, in the interest of civilisation, whether it shall
not be stopped by other hands than their own. The time seems to be
fast approaching for that solution of the difficulty. The South has
merited the recognition of the world, and has a right to claim it, as
a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government, able to hold its own
against all enemies. If its indomitable energy, its dauntless
perseverance, its countless sacrifices, and a heroism that even its
Northern enemies are generous enough to admire in the lulls and pauses
of the struggle, are not sufficient to secure for it a recognition
into the family of nations, it has a colder, but perhaps a stronger,
claim in the fact that it is not the practice of modern times or
civilised nations, neither of England, nor of France, nor of the
United States themselves, when they were one Government, to deny
recognition to any <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Government that has
successfully maintained its position for a reasonable length of
time. The Southern nation has that right at the least, and all mere
questions <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> fall as completely to the
ground in its presence as they did in the case of the French
Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and of the assumption of Imperial power
by Napoleon III, and a hundred others that i[t] is needless to
recapitulate.</p>

<p>Were there a faint prospect that the North might yet prevail a
timid European Power might hesitate even now to do scanty justice to
the South; but there is no such prospect to justify even a second or
third rate Power from withholding its recognition, much less France
and England, that are strong enough to do justice and to care not whom
they offend by it. The fear that war with the North would result from
such action is both groundless and unworthy. In the first place, there
would be no <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> by the law of nations;
in the second, the Northern States would have too much to do to
remodel their own Union and pay the expenses of their separation from
the South to have time or heart for a war in which the whole world
would be against them; and, in the third place, there is a large and
influential party in the United States who, instead of deprecating
such friendly intervention on the part of Europe, would look upon its
refusal as the greatest calamity that could befall the North, and the
unkindest possible policy that Europe could pursue towards
it. Southern independence is no longer a dream, but a fact; and, in
justice to all parties, it ought to be acknowledged, as much for the
sake of the North as for that of the South, and as much for the sake
of the suffering industry of Great Britain and France as for that of
both of the combatants.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Norwegian we have received telegrams, vi&#xE2; Cape
Race, to the evening of the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The Federals and Confederates have had another week of battles
resulting in the evacuation by the latter of the soil of Maryland. Of
the action on the 14th, at Hagerstown, Maryland, General M'Clellan
reports as follows:--<q>After a very severe engagement the corps of
Generals Hooker and Reno have carried the heights commanding
Hagerstown-road by storm. . . . The action continued after dark, and
terminated leaving us in possession of the entire crest of the
heights. . . .General Reno was killed.</q></p>
<p>On the side of the Confederates General Garland, of North Carolina
was killed.</p>

<p>On the next day General M'Clellan reports General Franklin's
success on the left, resulting in the capture of the Gap and 1000
prisoners. On the 15th the Federals pursued the Confederates, who took
their stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland, under the command of General
Lee. The 16th was chiefly occupied in deploying the forces and gaining
positions; but on Wednesday, the 17th, a severe battle was fought,
lasting from dawn till dusk. The result of the battle was not very
decisive; but the superiority of position remained with the
Federals. They estimate their loss at from 6000 to 10,000 men. Their
loss in Generals and field officers is almost unprecedented. General
Mansfield was killed, and Generals Hooker, Duryea, Sumner,
T. F. Meagher, Max Weber, Dana, Hartsuff, Richardson, Sedgwick,
Ricketts, French, and Rodman were wounded.</p>

<p>Little beyond skirmishing occurred on Thursday, the l8th. On Friday
General M'Clellan reports that the enemy abandoned his position in the
preceding night, leaving dead and wounded on the field.</p>

<p>The Confederates commenced recrossing the Potomac at Shepherdstown
Bridge, and two fords above and below it, early on Thursday
night. General Jackson conducted the retreat into Virginia, and
suffered only a slight loss in waggons and artillery, and 300 wounded
men. Early on Friday General Pleasanton pursued the retreating forces
with two batteries and two regiments of infantry, and captured some of
their ammunition and supplies and a small portion of a South Carolina
brigade. The Confederates retreated towards Winchester. The Federals
by last accounts were crossing the Potomac at Shepardstown and
Williamsport.</p>

<p>Generals Siegel and Heintzelmann remained for the defence of
Washington.</p>

<p>The Federal Colonel Miles, with 6000 men, surrendered at Harper's
Ferry to General Jackson on the 14th. The property delivered up
consisted of 10,000 stand of arms and more than forty guns, of which
only seven were spiked. The commissary stores consisted of six days'
rations for 12,000 men. Harper's Ferry was only won after three days'
fighting. The Federals were immediately paroled. On the 18th the
Confederates evacuated this position after destroying what stores they
could not carry away, also the pontoon-bridge and the bridge of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.</p>

<p>The Federal garrison at Mumfordsville, Kentucky, numbering 4500
men, with ten pieces of artillery, surrendered on the 17th to General
Bragg, whose forces numbered 30,000.</p>

<p>The Confederates have gained some advantages over the Federals in
Western Virginia.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Federal gun-boats on the Mississippi have
been active. They have destroyed Prentice and <sic corr="Bayon">Bayou</sic> Sara, in
Mississippi, leaving in the latter place only two houses
standing. Natchez was also bombarded for two hours and a half. The
city then surrendered, but was not occupied by the assailants.</p>

<p>The iron-clad Confederate steamer Ovieto has entered Mobile in full
view of the blockading squadron. Commander Preble has been dismissed
the United States' service for his laches on this occasion.</p>

<p>Draughting in the Northern States had generally been postponed for
a few weeks on the authority of the Governors of the several States,
who hope to be able to make up their quotas by voluntary
enlistment. In Connecticut the draught had been made, and had caused a
few slight disturbances. The Governors of Pennsylvania and Ohio have
issued a call to the Governors of all the Union States to meet on the
24th at Altoona, Pennsylvania. The subject of their deliberations will 
probably relate to the feasibility of the forced conscription.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>
<p>The Richmond <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> says that the expenses of
the Confederate Government since the commencement of the war to August
of this year amount to 347,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress has adopted a resolution to make a
proposition to the Federal Government to treat upon the manner of
conducting the war so as to mitigate its horrors. A resolution was
passed recalling Messrs. Mason and Slidell.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>Mr. G.F. Train, late of London, had arrived at Boston, and received
a public welcome at the Revere House. He lectured, the evening after
his arrival, to a large audience in Tremont Temple. He cleared 500
dols. by his address, which he devoted to the Soldiers' Fund. His
theme was "England," which he proclaimed to be "a great sham." He has
gone on to Washington, to have an audience with President Lincoln and
Secretary Seward. He received, immediately on his arrival in Boston,
ninety-three applications to lecture.</p>

<p>The cricket-match of the season between eleven of the military of
Canada against eleven civilians of the United States, selected from
the St. George, New York, and Philadelphia Clubs, was played at
Hoboken, a suburb of New York city, on the 10th and 11th ult., and
resulted in a victory for the Americans, with five wickets to
spare.</p>

<p>On the 17th ult. a frightful explosion took place at the
Pennsylvania State arsenal, Pittsburg. It occurred in a large frame
building known as the laboratory; 170 boys and girls were employed in
the building at the time of the disaster, of whom seventy-five or
eighty were killed. One explosion followed another, until the entire
building was destroyed, and those who could not escape in time were
burnt. The cause of the explosion is not known, but it is admitted by
all to have been accidental.</p>

<p>The Provost-Marshal at St. Louis has received instructions
immediately to carry out the Confiscation Act in Missouri. The
property liable to confiscation is estimated at 50,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>The first body of free negro emigrants to Central America under the
President's colonisation scheme was to start early in October in a
first-class steamer. Senator Pomeroy, of Kansas, is conductor. The
first body was to consist of 500 emigrants, nearly all of them
provided with implements of husbandry and a full outfit of domestic
utensils. Among the advance party are two of Frederick Douglass's
sons.</p></div2>

<p>"News of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker" when he speaks
American news. While English writers are commenting upon the gallant
deeds of the South and considering the life of Cromwell for the
illustration of that of Jackson, they are suddenly called upon to
postpone their historical parallels and to record that at length
General M'Clellan, aroused to a sense of the value of time, has
marched rapidly to meet the invaders, has closed with them, and, after
some battles of extraordinary savageness, has driven them back--how
far it is not known, but it is certain that the invasion has been for
the time repelled. M'Clellan has not only repulsed the Confederates
but has vindicated his own character and the confidence which was
placed in him by the army which he made; and, without reference to the
struggle itself, those in England who have all along rebuked the
ingratitude with which his early and patient services were requited,
and who felt a kind of impatient pity for a populace that preferred
the vaunt and swagger of such leaders as Pope to the steady
perseverance of M'Clellan, are glad to have an opportunity of once
more doing him the justice which his countrymen were inclined to
refuse him. Another mail may place him in a situation of another kind;
but the educated and conscientious officer has now shown the Union the
difference between a real soldier, in the hour of need, and the vain
"self-made" Generals who have been thrown to the front by a score of
influences with which professional fitness has had nothing to do. We
learn that in Kentucky an important advantage has been gained by the
Confederates, and that a very extensive capture of prisoners has been
made, and also that the retreat of the invading army was conducted
with perfect order, although, of course, it was necessary to flavour
the telegrams with sensational polysyllables for the public of New
York. . . .</p>

<p>Our revenue return is, all will hear with pleasure, and many with
surprise, most satisfactory. Certain advocates of America who hoped
that a black balance-sheet would appear to strike a chill upon the
hearts that refused to be exalted by Mr. Seward and General Pope must
be sorely disappointed at finding that, though the "War for Empire"
has injured us in one way, it has largely benefited us in another; and
that the North has come as an excellent customer, though not for the
articles it was accustomed to apply for.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>Our Special Artist in America has sent to us an Illustration, which
we give on the preceding page, showing the Confederate scouting party
under General Stuart, skirmishing with a portion of General Pope's
army in the neighbourhood of Culpepper Courthouse. General Stuart's
fame reached England after his marvellous raid round the extreme right
of M'Clellan's army, whilst the latter was threatening Richmond. It is
unnecessary to remind our readers of this gallant dash, which will
take its place in the history of cavalry tactics. Probably many will be
surprised at the rough and worn appearance of the men, especially when
they are told that many of the privates are worth from 50,000 to 100,000
dollars each. The rudeness of their equipments, consisting mainly of
old rusty sabres and shot-guns, is in a great degree owing to the
blockade, which shuts them out of the market of good carbines and
fine-tempered blades. As it is, they are the finest irregular body of
horse in the world.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S PROCLAMATION.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> Australasian, from New York on the
24th ult., which arrived at Queenstown early on Sunday morning last,
bought over copies of a document which has excited the liveliest
interest on this side of the Atlantic.  It is a proclamation of
Mr. President Lincoln declaring all persons held as slaves within any
State, or any designated part of a State, which shall be in rebellion
against the United States on the 1st of January, 1863, "thenceforward
and for ever free." On that day the Executive "will designate the
States, and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof
respectively shall then be in rebellion against the United States,"
the fact of any State, or its people, being at that day represented in
Congress by members legally chosen to be deemed, "in the absence of
strong countervailing testimony," conclusive of its loyalty. The tone
of this proclamation, the circumstances under which it was issued, the
conditions upon which it is to take effect, and the party views which
it is understood to represent, compel us to regard this instrument as
having been rather forged for war purposes than fashioned as a basis
of national policy--as a weapon against the foes of the United States'
Government, rather than as a frank but tardy exposition of what is
just between man and man.</p>

<p> We deeply regret being obliged to consider the Presidential
proclamation in this light.  The question of slavery is one in which
we have taken so deep an interest, on account of the moral
considerations it involves, that we should have preferred a solution of
it by those moral forces which take their rise in the conscience of
the people.  Emancipation is, in our view, too sacred a thing--too
closely associated with immutable justice and with goodwill to all
men--to be hurled as a thunderbolt of war against a population in
arms.  Had the Northern States, <pb n="374"/>at the outset of what they naturally
regarded as rebellion in the South, seized the occasion for declaring
that in no possible issue of events could they allow themselves to be
again entangled in a system condemned alike by man and by God--had
they publicly recognised, as they might well have done, Secession as
the inevitable retribution of their own complicity in a system which
their consciences denounced as evil, and; on that recognition, washed
their hands of all future participation in this great national
crime--had they, by any word or deed bearing upon it the stamp of
authority, done homage, even by a late and enforced repentance, to the
essential Christian truths and principles upon which slavery had
ruthlessly trampled, and not without their consent; and had they, in
distinct deference to the claims of morality and religion, inscribed
upon their banners a motto to the effect that the soil of the United
States should thenceforward be consecrated to freedom alone, the whole
world would have sympathised with, even if it could not have approved,
their efforts to recover dominion over the seceded half of the
empire. It is clear, however, that the commercial profits of Southern
slavery were far too highly appreciated by the North to admit of its
offering them up upon the altar of justice at the behest of
conscience. The President's proclamation, interpreted as an expression
of the national will, is a sacrifice (if sacrifice that may be called
in which the thing given up is already beyond reach) to political
passion rather than to reason and religion; and, whatever may be its
ultimate effect, we can only welcome it for what it is, not for the
spirit and temper of which it is the symbol.</p>

<p>Considered as a politico-strategical movement the proclamation will
scarcely, we imagine, be found to answer the purpose which it was
issued to effect. That it will not be operative beyond the frontier
which may be held by the Federal armies on the 1st of January, 1863,
is rendered more than probable by the significant teaching of almost
all the facts that have any bearing on the case. Explain the matter as
we will, whether as the result of the brutal ignorance in which they
have been kept, the terrorism exercised over them, or the depravation
of spirit which slavery, as a social system, necessarily produces, it
has been demonstrated that hitherto the slaves themselves have not
displayed the eagerness which might have been anticipated to rush
towards the few doors which the army orders of some commanders, or the
fortune of war in some localities, have opened for their escape. We
fear that so long as a powerful Confederate army is afoot the document
will he a dead letter in the Southern States, serving no purpose but
that of confirming the resolution of the white population to listen to
no terms short of final separation from the Union. It will be
interpreted as a threat, and a threat is always impolitic unless when
there exists behind it adequate force to carry it into execution. It
is more likely to be read by the South as a signal of Federal weakness
than as a warning of coming judgment; and we are by no means sure that
it will not do more to help Jefferson Davis than Abraham Lincoln. It
will certainly unite all parties in the South, and infuse new vigour
into their determination to he independent, and probably without
rousing any proportionate enthusiasm in the North. There, instead of
binding all classes more closely together and arming the Government
with increased moral authority, it seems better fitted to widen the
breach between the Republicans and the Democrats, and to stimulate the
desire of the mercantile and moneyed magnates to close the contest as
speedily as possible. Since the step has been taken, and cannot be
retraced, we should be glad to discover in it some promise of
success. We own, however, to a fear lest the Presidential
proclamation, besides marring, to some extent, the moral aspects of
emancipation, will entail upon it the imputation--the heaviest which
in these utilitarian days can be fastened upon it--of being
responsible for a great practical failure.</p>

<p>The foregoing considerations would have had some weight with us
even if the declaration of Mr. Lincoln's proclamation had been enacted
in some form by Congress. As an embodiment of the supreme legislative
authority of the Union it would have been open to cavil as a violation
of fundamental constitutional law. But as a mere decree of the
Executive it can have no permanent validity, and there are, doubtless,
hundreds of thousands of intelligent Americans who, earnestly as they
may approve the object sought to be realised, will discern in the
means resorted to for attaining it a frightful danger to free
institutions. The man who thus assumes to set aside for ever one of
the bases of the Federal Constitution may hereafter, upon equally
urgent pretexts, bring the same despotism to bear upon all. He
becomes, thenceforth, an autocrat, not merely in the direction of the
war but in the determination of future national policy. The personal
freedom of blacks may thus become the occasion of political slavery to
the whites, and the stain of one crime be blotted out by the deeper
dye of another. We do not ourselves auger ill of the political future
of the North--we have little fear that twenty millions of
Anglo-Saxons, long accustomed to self-government, will submit their
interests to the management of irresponsible power one moment beyond
the felt necessity of the crisis; but just in proportion to our
confidence that when this civil war is at an end the people will
resume their authority is our conviction that the proclamation can be
regarded only as a <hi rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi>, which will be
set aside as of no effect when matters return to their ordinary
channels.</p>

<p>The sole practical advantage of Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, as it
seems to us, will be realised in its sweeping Federal complicity with
slavery out of the political creed of the North.  We conceive that it
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> have this effect.  The whole question has
been placed in a position, as regards the Federal States, from which
there can be no return.  It resembles the free-trade movement in this
country after the announcement by Sir Robert Peel of his conversion to
its doctrines.  No party in the States will henceforth be strong
enough to occupy the platform of "The Union as it was and the
Constitution as it is." The decision of the President, devoid of legal
authority though it may be, will so entirely undermine the whole
region of compromise that hereafter there can be no secure political
footing upon it. Coupled with the Act of Congress which last Session
enfranchised the district of Columbia, it assures us of the moral
certainty that there can be no resumption of partnership between the
North and the South in the business, profits, and interests of negro
slavery. All Europe has long foreseen the improbability of a
reconstruction of the Union. It is reviving to be certified, as we now
are, that, should the Border States remain with the Northern section,
they can only do so by purging themselves of the crime which they have
not yet renounced, and that, if they should eventually fall to the
South, they could not maintain the accursed system even if they
would. After what has happened no room is left for a Fugitive Slave
Law between North and South; and Virginia, Maryland, Missouri,
Kentucky, and Tennessee will find it more troublesome and expensive to
uphold the "domestic institution" along the frontier of a free,
independent Power than to accept compensation for the "chattels" they
may surrender and to work out emancipation in their own way and
time. The President's proclamation will, no doubt, help to convince
them that the status quo of American slavery is hopeless and for ever
gone.</p>

<p>Subject, then, to the rather large deductions we have felt
ourselves compelled to make, we still regard the political document
upon which we have animadverted as one of the highest importance. That
it will help in any material degree to retrieve the misfortunes of the
Union we strongly doubt; that it exhibits the political sentiment of
the North in a light likely to do credit to themselves, or to impart
to the policy of emancipation the moral grandeur which fairly belongs
to it, we are sorry to find ourselves precluded from asserting; but
that it heralds the approaching doom of slavery, and denotes the
impracticability of suspending that doom by temporising expedients, we
look upon as demonstrable. We should have been glad to mingle with our
joy at the inevitable extinction of the "domestic institution"
admiration of the motives and the means by which its guilty days have
been numbered. But, even from the hands of a grudging necessity,
Europe will accept the issue with gratitude; and there will be a
thrill of pleasure amongst the civilised nations of the earth that a
great people (which the Northern section of the Union must ever
remain) have at length removed from their political programme that
fruitful source of national demoralisation--connivance with
slavery.</p></div2>

<p> By the arrival of the Canadian steamer, Bohemian, we have received
telegrams, vi&#xE2; Cape Race, to the evening of Sept. 29.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">President Lincoln's Proclamation
of Emancipation.</hi></p>
<p>The most important news of the week is the issue of the following
important proclamation:--
<q><p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcap">Washington</hi>. Sept. 22.</p>
<p>I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America and
Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy thereof, do hereby proclaim
and declare that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the object
of practically restoring the constitutional relations between the
United States and the people thereof, in which States that relation
is, or may be, suspended or disturbed; that it is my purpose, upon the
next meeting of Congress, to again recommend the adoption of a
practical measure tending pecuniary aid to the free acceptance or
rejection of all the Slave States, so called, the people whereof may not
be in rebellion against the United States, and which States may then
have voluntarily adopted, or thereafter may voluntarily adopt, the
immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery within their respective
limits; and that the efforts to colonise persons of African descent,
with their consent, upon the continent or elsewhere, with the
previously-obtained consent of the Governments existing there, will be
continued; that on the 1st day of January, in the year of our Lord
1863, all persons held as slaves within any State, or any designated
part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against
the United States, shall be thenceforward and for ever free; and the
executive Government of the United States, including the military and
naval authority thereof, will recognise and maintain the freedom of
such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or
any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom;
that the executive will on the 1st day of January aforesaid, by
proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in
which the people thereof respectively shall then be in rebellion
against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people
thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented in the
Congress of the United States by members chosen thereto at elections
wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such State shall have
participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony,
be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people thereof
are not then in rebellion against the United States.</p>

<p>That attention is hereby called to an Act of Congress, entitled,
"An Act to make an additional Article of War," approved March 13,
1862, and which Act is in the words and figures following:--</p>

<p>"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled, that hereafter the
following shall be promulgated as an additional article of war for the
government of the army of the United States, and shall be obeyed and
observed as such:--</p>
<p>" 'Article.--All officers or persons in the military or naval
service of the United States are prohibited from employing any of the
forces under their respective commands for the purpose of returning
fugitives from service or labour who may have escaped from any persons
to whom such service or labour is claimed to be due, and any officer
who shall be found guilty by a court-martial of violating this article
shall be dismissed from the service.'</p>
<p>"Section 2.--And be it further enacted, that this Act shall take
effect from and after its passage."</p>

<p>Also to the ninth and tenth sections of an Act entitled 'An Act to
suppress insurrection, to punish treason and rebellion, to seize and
confiscate property of rebels, and for all other purposes,' approved
July 17, 1862, and which sections are in the words and figures
following:--</p>
<p>"Section 9.--And be it further enacted that all slaves or persons
who shall hereafter be engaged in rebellion against the Government of
the United States, <pb n="375"/>or who shall in any way give aid and
comfort thereto, escaping from such persons and taking refuge within
the lines of the  army, and all slaves captured from such persons or
deserted by them, and coming under the control of the Government of
the United States, and all slaves of such persons found on (or being
within) any place occupied by rebel forces and afterwards occupied by
the forces of the United States, shall be deemed captures of war, and
shall be for ever free of their servitude, and not again held as
slaves.</p>
<p>"Section 10.--And be it further enacted, that no slave escaping
into any State, territory, or the district of Columbia, from any of
the States, shall be delivered up, or in any way impeded or hindered
of his liberty, except for crime or some offence against the laws,
unless the person claiming said fugitive shall first make oath that
the person to whom the labour or service of such fugitive is alleged
to be due is his lawful owner, and has not been in arms against the
United States in the present rebellion, nor in any way given aid and
comfort thereto; and no person engaged in the military or naval
service of the United States shall, under any pretence whatever,
assume to decide on the validity of the claim of any person to the
service or labour of any other person, or surrender up any person to
the claimant, on pain of being dismissed from the service."</p>

<p>And I do hereby enjoin upon and order all persons engaged in the
military and naval service of the United States to observe, obey, and
enforce within their respective sphere of service the Act and sections
above recited.</p>

<p>And the Executive will in due time recommend that all citizens of
the United States who shall have remained loyal throughout the
rebellion shall, upon the restoration of the constitutional relations
between the United States and people (if the relation shall have been
suspended or disturbed), be compensated for all losses by acts of the
United States, including the loss of slaves.</p>

<p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal
of the United States to be affixed. <hi rend="right"> <hi rend="smallcap">Abraham
Lincoln.</hi></hi></p>

<p>Done at the City of Washington, this 22nd of September, in the year
of our Lord 1862, and of the Independence of the United States the
87th.</p>
<p rend="center">By the President,</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcap">William H. Seward</hi>, Secretary
of State.</p></q></p>

<p>The Republican press approve of this proclamation; the Democratic
press regard it with hostility. The governors of sixteen Northern
States assembled at Altoona on the 24th ult. and adjourned on the 25th
to Washington, where they presented an address to President Lincoln,
expressing their determination to support his constitutional
authority, approving the emancipation proclamation, and suggesting the
expediency of raising a reserve force of 100,000 men. The Governor of
Maryland objected to sign the address.</p>

<p>The President has been serenaded at Washington, on which occasion
he made a speech, saying that he issued the proclamation after full
deliberation and under a heavy sense of responsibility. He trusted in
God that he had made no mistake. It was now for America and the world,
he said, to judge of the proclamation and, it may be, to take action
upon it.</p>

<p>The Chicago Emancipation Committee have published President
Lincoln's reply to them, delivered an Sept. 13. The President therein
states that he did not favour emancipation, as it would be inoperative
if issued, and if the slaves were armed their arms would fall into the
hands of the rebels.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The Federals have made two unsuccessful efforts to cross the
Potomac at Sheperdstown into Virginia, but were each time
repulsed. General M'Clellan has constructed a pontoon bridge upon
which to cross the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. The Confederates have
made Winchester, Virginia, the basis of their operations, but keep a
force on the bank of the Potomac to prevent the Federals from
crossing.</p>

<p>An engagement occurred on the 19th ult. south of Juka, Mississippi,
between General Rosencrantz and General Price. The Confederates
retreated south during the night. The Federals captured 250
prisoners.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>General Davis shot General Nelson, commanding at Louisville,
Kentucky, on the 29th, killing him instantly. The affair occurred
through a personal dispute.</p>

<p>The draught in Philadelphia was to be carried into effect on the
25th ult. In New York 40,000 men were to be raised in the same manner
on the 10th inst. The President has suspended the writ of habeas
corpus and declared martial law throughout the United States with
respect to all persons arrested for aiding the rebellion or hindering
the draught.</p>

<p>In the money market gold has risen to the premium of 23 &#xBD; per

<p>The Confederates have just sustained a rather serious loss on our
own shores.  The steam-ship Iona, which is said to have been purchased
by the Southern Government, was leaving the Clyde for one of the
Confederate ports with a heavy cargo of warlike stores on Thursday
week when she was run down by another vessel and sent to the bottom.

<p>Although a small body of Federal cavalry and artillery under
General Pleasanton had crossed the Potomac at Shepherdstown, ten miles
above Harper's Ferry, the situation of the two large armies on either
side of the Potomac remains unchanged. President Lincoln had passed
several days in visiting Harper's Ferry and the Antietam battle-field
and reviewing the troops.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan officially reports that the total Federal loss in
the battles of Antietam Creek and South Mountain was 14,700 in killed,
wounded, and missing. From the time when the Federals first<pb n="399"/> encountered the enemy in Maryland up to the time when the
enemy was driven into Virginia the Federals have captured thirteen
guns and thirty-nine colours--they losing neither guns nor
colours. The Federals have collected 14,000 smallarms on the Antietam
battle-field. They have likewise captured 5000 prisoners, of whom 1200
were wounded, and have buried 3000 rebels. General M'Clellan thinks
that these two engagements cost the enemy at least 30,000 of their
best troops.  The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi> has information
that the entire Confederate loss at the battle of Manassas was 5000,
and in all the engagements in Maryland about 7000.</p>

<p>The Federal General Rodman, inventor of the Rodman gun, who was
wounded at Antietam Creek, has since died.</p>

<p>The Federal General Morgan has evacuated Cumberland Gap with his
entire force, and was on his march to the Ohio River. On evacuating
the Gap General Morgan sprang the mines, closing the passage through
the mountains so completely as to make it entirely impassable. All the
stores, artillery, and munitions of war were either brought away or
destroyed.</p>

<p>A large portion of General Buell's army has moved towards the
interior of Kentucky in several columns. The Confederates have burnt
Augusta in this State, forty miles east of Cincinnati. An explosion
took place at the arsenal in Columbus on the 25th ult., destroying a
large amount of ordnance stores and cotton.</p>

<p>General Beauregard had assumed the command of the Confederate Army
in South Carolina and Georgia.</p>

<p>Five companies of Federals had attacked Potchatoula, near New
Orleans, but were repulsed with heavy loss.</p>

<p>The steamer Kate, from Nassau, had run the blockade into
Wilmington. A schooner with 4500 bushels of salt also ran in. Another
schooner, attempting the same thing, ran aground, and was under fire of
the blockading steamers for several hours. She had not succeeded in
getting off. On the 19th a large paddle-wheeled steamer escaped from
Charleston through Sanford's Channel. Two ships, laden with cotton to
the amount of 1300 bales, had arrived at Havannah from Mobile and a
Texan port. The Federal gun-boats had been ordered to the mouth of the
Rio Grande.</p>

<p>The British prize-steamers Circassian, Memphis, Bermuda, Stettin,
and Columbia were being fitted out as Federal cruisers.</p>

<p>Advices from New Orleans report that a large number of persons have
taken the oath of allegiance to avoid the penalties of the
Confiscation Act, which General Butler is rigidly going to
enforce.</p>

<p>A despatch from St. Paul, Minnesota, states that on the 23rd 300
Indians attacked Colonel Sibley's command. The battle lasted two
hours, resulting in the repulse of the Indians, with the loss of
thirty killed and a large number wounded. Four whites were killed and
from thirty to forty wounded.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>The Confederate Congress have had the emancipation proclamation
under their consideration. A resolution has been introduced denouncing
it as a gross violation of the usages of war and worthy of the
execration of mankind. It must be counteracted by such severe 
retaliatory measures as in the judgment of President Davis may be
calculated to secure its withdrawal or arrest its execution.</p>

<p>The Confederate House of Representatives had finally passed the 
new Conscription Bill, applicable to all men between thirty-five and 
forty-five years of age, by a vote of 54 against 29.</p>

<p>Yellow fever is raging at Wilmington, North Carolina.</p>

<p>The State of New York had raised 30,000 three years' volunteers
over her quota under the first call for 300,000 men, and volunteers
for nine months would now be accepted to fill up the second
call. 20,000 more men were needed. The draught had been a failure in
many parts of the State of Connecticut.</p>
<p>The Border States do not approve of the emancipation
proclamation.</p>
<p>General Wadsworth is the Republican, and Mr. Horatio Seymour the
Democratic nominee for the New York governorship. Public expectation
looks forward to the result of this election with interest, as sure to
indicate the predominant opinion of the people of the Middle States on
the new policy recently announced by the President.</p>

<p>Lord Monck has been enthusiastically received by the people of
Canada West. After completing this tour he crossed the border, and was
last heard of at Chicago, en route for the prairies of Illinois for a
few days' shooting. He was accompanied by the Governor of Nova
Scotia.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">President Lincoln's</hi> proclamation furnishes
abundant matter for discussion by the American press; but as, under the
beneficent rule of King Abraham, that press is much less free to
comment upon public affairs than is the journalism of France, the
criticism of Union writers is of a hesitating kind--that is to say,
where disapproval of the proclamation has to be set forth. Point-blank
opinion might consign the utterer to a prison whence release is not
very easy, and therefore those who dislike the President's act go very
little further than speculation as to its possible results. Of course
those who desire to praise it are permitted to do so with the utmost
vigour of almost profane laudation. Indeed, one journal accords to it
an origin which we are afraid to describe, one which would entitle it
to be read alternately with mandates which both sides appear to have
forgotten in the excitement of fratricide. The opinion of most
Americans would seem to be that the proclamation has completed the
work of separation and has widened the rift in the rock; and all
apparently agree that it would be impossible for any reunion to be
accomplished while the author of that document should remain at the
head of the State. Mr. Lincoln himself, like most weak men when they
have done violent things, is very self-distrustful, and "hopes to God
that he has made no mistake." The war news is scant; the dead have
been counted, and the number is fearfully in advance of what had been
put forward as an estimate. There has been no detailed official
account of the great battle which repelled the Confederates, and it is
naturally surmised that the Republic of the North was at one time in
greater peril than the Government chooses should be pointed out by
military critics. The movements of the Confederates are variously
described; but another engagement was expected. It seems hardly worth
mentioning amid such a crisis, and yet the fact is characteristic of
American manners, that President Lincoln has given special audience to
a person named Train, who was for a short time a little notorious in
London--this man having merited the notice of his President by a
furious speech, in which he denounced England as a nation of cowards
and bankrupts and expressed his hopes for the success of an Irish
rebellion. Would a person who had said a tenth part as much against
the Americans be received by an English Minister? Yet the Americans
affect surprise when told that they display animosity towards us. We
must now await in meekness the storm that will follow their receipt of
Mr. Gladstone's and Sir G. Lewis's speeches, in which the success of
the South is described as all but certain.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK, AND THE INTERNATIONAL</p>
<p rend="center">EXHIBITION.</p>

<p>...While talking of Professor Owen we may remark that the
monkey-versus-man controversy which, at the recent meeting of the
British Association, led to such a sharp verbal encounter between
Messrs. Owen and Huxley, has, to the great disappointment of the
quarrelsome, failed in provoking anything like continued discussion. A
spasmodic attempt to keep up the ball was made in a burlesque letter
from "A Gorilla," which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>;
but the public is languid just now about every mortal thing save the
American War, and has no time to waste upon the brainpans of
baboons. People seem very well satisfied with the inward conviction
that they are not apes, and trouble themselves very little as to
whether the apes are or are not our "poor relations."</p>

<p>"The troops skedaddled." This incongruous expression has, since the
outburst of the Cain and Abel contest in America, become familiar in
our mouths--not precisely as household words, for Englishmen, we
trust, will be never given to "skedaddling;" but as any other
eccentric Transatlanticism, such as "absquatulating," "taking tracks,"
"sloping," "wilting," "vamosing," &#x0026;c. To "skedaddle" is, in
Federal language, to run away; but a North British philologist has
lately discovered that the word is Scotch, not American, and that
"skedaddling" is simply the action of "jabbling," or shaking the
contents of milkpails of which the yoke is not accurately balanced on
the milkmaid's shoulders. We accept the North British theory. Will the
Caledonian sage accept our etymology? A "skid" or "kid" is a tub-pail
or bucket. To "addle" is obvious: hence "skedaddling" is only
"addling" or decomposing the lacteal contents of a "skid."</p>

<p>Although the Americans have introduced a vast amount of slang into
the Anglo-Saxon tongue, many of the so-called "Americanisms" are
simply provincial and archaic terms hundreds of years old, conveyed to
the plantations by the very first settlers in Virginia or
Massachusetts whence they have been retransmitted to the mother
country. On the other hand, many words to which an American origin, or
at least modification, may be conceded, are improvements rather than
defects in our tongue. Take the adjective "lengthy" for instance: a
word which is to be found in all modern dictionaries, albeit generally
inserted under protest as a superfluous innovation, but which
Mr. Richard Rush, the accomplished Minister from the United States to
this country, assured Mr. Canning, in 1818, was an American word
devised by his ingenious countrymen to signify a thing being <hi rend="italic">tedious</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">long.</hi></p></div2>

<p>The Pacific Telegraph Company have erected their wires between the
Missouri and the Sierra Nevada, a distance of 1600 miles, and thus
completed the telegraphic communication between the Atlantic and
Pacific in four months and seventeen days. The company have entered
into an arrangement with the Emperor of Russia by which, conjointly,
they will construct a continuous line through British and Russian
America, across Behring's Straits, and through Asiatic and European
Russia, so as to connect St. Petersburg and Washington. This line will
be 14,000 miles in length. Russia has already completed 3500 miles and
collected materials for extending the wires from Siberia to the mouth
of the Amoor, the Mississippi of Asiatic Russia.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE DOWNFALL OF AMERICAN SLAVERY.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">It</hi> is one of the standing reproaches
against the American Democracy that the good work of the abolition of
slavery in the British West Indies called forth from them no
responsive congratulatory echo. It is our ambition as journalists
that, so far as it depends on us to prevent it, a similar reproach may
not lie against the English people. This is our apology for recurring
once more to the momentous step lately taken by the Cabinet of
Washington.</p>

<p>This generation is fortunate in living in an age one of whose chief
characteristics is the emancipation of enslaved races and the
liberation of oppressed nationalities. Middle-aged men can remember
the occasion of the abolition of slavery in the dependencies and
colonies of the British empire. The Revolution of 1848 extracted from
the Provisional Government of the French Republic a similar
measure. The emancipation of the Jews is always in progress in various
quarters of the civilised world. In the Austrian empire, Poland, and
Roumania the peasants have of late years been freed from the vestiges
of medi&#xE6;val servitude, the Christian Rayahs of the Turkish empire
have obtained concessions of which neither the conquering nor the
conquered race dreamed a generation ago, while the crowning triumph of
all is the manumission and endowment of 20,000,000 of Russian
serfs. Even war itself, normally an instrument for the subjection of
humanity, sometimes puts on in this [a]ge an exceptionally liberating
character. Italy has but just been the theatre of two phenomenal wars
which shed [l]ustre on the names of Napoleon III, and Giuseppe
Garibaldi. And now the 22nd of September, 1862, has inaugurated a
policy which enables us to add another to this select class of
wars.</p>

<p>While we have never made these columns the vehicle for wilful
disparagement of the Northern cause, we have always spoken of the
American war as being, on the part of the Federals, a war for
empire. We regarded the words of Garibaldi contained in his "Address
to the English Nation" --words which spoke of the United States as
"struggling for the abolition of slavery"--as at least premature if
not altogether fallacious. Six days before the penning of those words
Abraham Lincoln had announced a policy which imparts to them a
retroactive justification. The war is still, on the part of the North,
primarily a war of empire; but it is henceforth, though secondarily, a
war of emancipation also. The President, whose name will go down to
history in connection with this memorable event, is too truthful and
unaffected a man to endeavour to put a false gloss upon it. "I . . . . declare
that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted for the
object of practically restoring the Constitutional relation between
the United States and the people thereof in which States that relation
is or may be suspended or disturbed." It is therefore, we repeat,
primarily a war for empire, in which the question of boundary plays no
part and the question of emancipation but a subordinate one.</p>

<p>We are not unmindful of the consideration that the wholesale and
sweeping concession of freedom to all slaves in the "rebel" States,
whether belonging to loyal or rebel masters, only comes into effect on
the first day of 1863; but the ninth section of the Confiscation Act,
quoted by the President as henceforward to be rigorously enforced, is
tantamount to a proclamation of general emancipation, inasmuch as in
the "rebel" States no "loyal" slaveowners, to whom the Confiscation
Act is inapplicable, have yet been discovered. Wherever the Union flag
shall penetrate it will, from this time forth, bring liberty to the
enslaved.</p>

<p>There is but one qualification to be made to this statement. It is
that if the "rebels" deign to accept Mr. Lincoln's proffered
bribe--the bribe of condonation--and will dutifully proceed this
autumn to elect members of Congress, to appear at Washington on any
day before the 1st of January next, then the presence of such
representatives "shall, in the absence of strong countervailing
testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State and the people
thereof are not then in rebellion against the United States." There
is, perhaps, another contingency to be dreaded. A too rapid career of
success on the part of the Northern armies might induce Congress at
its next Session to repeal the Confederate Act and annul or declare
unconstitutional the remaining portions of the President's
proclamation. The possibility of such a tergiversation may justify the
friends of the slave in hoping that the Confederates may continue to
posses their capital until the 1st of January, when the Rubicon which
separates the Union "as it was" from the Union "as it ought to be"
will he crossed without possibility of return. The Abolitionists of
Europe and America cannot afford to forget that the Federals'
difficulty has hitherto been their opportunity, and that the leaven of
their ideas has mingled with the public mind according as the Federal
armies have retreated before the hosts of Beauregard, Lee, and
Jackson. Had either M'Clellan's summer campaign or Pope's subsequent
strategy succeeded, who is simpleton enough to believe that the
proclamation of Sept. 22 would now have seen the light? Even now, in
spite of the humiliating reverses of the North, in spite of the
resentments caused by the uncontradicted tales of barbarities
inflicted on the Northern dead and wounded (of Northern skulls used as
soap-dishes, of finger-bones used as toothpicks, and so forth), so
strong is the sentiment of Negrophobia in the North, so bitter the
thought that out of this war there may accrue to the sovereign
citizens on either side nought but loss, while the slaves will reap
all the gains--that all the world turns to see how the proclamation is
received at the North. And how is it received? By no burst of
enthusiasm, but with an ominous and sullen silence, which conceals a
more positive sentiment of aversion. Not only the Democratic journals,
but the Conservative Republican ones also regard the measure as a
nauseous pill, which they gild and sweeten by the assurance, which
they do not themselves credit, that the proclamation itself will
remain a dead letter. Never were there more unwilling liberators than
the Northern people, politicians, and army. There was an <hi rend="italic">&#xE9;lan</hi> about the manner in which this undemocratic
British nation set about the work of slave emancipation, in which the
Autocrat of all the Russias set himself to a similar duty, and in
which the Emperor of the French proclaimed the liberation of Italy
from the Alps to the Adriatic, which, at least, did credit to our
European human nature, but for whose slightest trace we look in vain
into President Lincoln's manifesto, countersigned though it be by that
deft master of rhetoric, William Henry Seward. In this feature of the
proclamation, in its total absence of false pretences, and what in his
mouth would savour of hypocritical cant, we may again admire the
President's native candour. The emancipation of the slaves is <hi rend="italic">denounced</hi> as a penalty against the contumacious
owners, who are informed in the same breath that they may avoid the
penalty by an act of homage to the powers that be at Washington. The
idea of bringing liberation to an oppressed race is as unwelcome to
the American democracy as it is welcome to us "servile and pauperised"
Europeans. There is some danger that on this occasion their jaundiced
prejudices may infect our English judgment. Else why do we already
hear from influential quarters that appeal to the commonplace claptrap
of slaveowners and their friends, the horrors of St. Domingo? As if it
was not rather to be feared lest the Federals will do too little than
too much; as if it were not time enough to speak of St. Domingo when
its massacres are re-enacted; and as if, even in this extreme case,
the slaveowner and his family are to count for everything and the
slave and his family (we will not say the negro slave, for the
American chattel is oftentimes as much, and even more European in his
lineage than African) for nothing. There is another slaveowners and
"sham-democratic" calumny afloat among us--namely, that the American
slaves do not desire freedom. As if such a sentiment did not run
counter to human nature itself, and were not belied by the whole
history of American slavery from the establishment of the "Underground
Railway" into Canada until the recent highly-gratifying experiment at
Hilton Head, the very focus of South Carolinian chattelism, and the
still more recent report of General Phelps upon the temper of the
slaves in Louisiana! When the autumn rains, swelling the currents of
every Southern river, shall enable the unconquered gun-boats of the
North to penetrate on all sides into the heart of the South, not as
heretofore to repel, but to "recognise and maintain the freedom" of
the fugitives, we shall see that the opportunity of [t]hrowing off the
ever odious yoke of chattel slavery will be joyfully seized by the
American bondman as previously by his brethren in other parts of the
continent and the adjacent islands.</p>

<p>The time chosen for the issue of the proclamation, though open to
the general objection stated by us last week, is nevertheless, in some
other and subordinate respects, well appointed. It could not have been
uttered with any dignity while Washington was threatened and the
Administration knew not whether they should next hear of the
Confederates in Pennsylvania or Baltimore. It follows on the heels of
a Federal victory; it is not wrung from the despair of a discomfited
host. It is bold and manly to issue it just on the eve of the
imposition of the severest test on Northern loyalty--the conscription;
and just in time to affect unfavourably to the Administration the
October and November elections. The same steamer which brings the news
of the proclamation of freedom to the enslaved brought also the
intelligence that the free white citizen and voter had been deprived
of the right to the writ of habeas corpus during the pendency of the
draught. This is the act of a Government which is conscious of its
strength and does not cower before the consequences of its own
acts. In the performance of this solemn historical act Mr. Lincoln has
eschewed any approach to that chicane and petty cunning which are apt
to be the besetting sins of lawyers who have turned statesmen.</p>

<p>Those slaveowners of Delaware, Maryland, Western Virginia,
Kentucky, and Missouri who have not forfeited their claim to the 
title of loyal citizens of the United States cannot hope, in the face
of abolitionist national policy, to maintain their slight interest in
the "domestic institution," amounting, if we deduct for the fugitives
that have escaped since the commencement of the war and for
forfeitures, to about 400,000 slaves, or a tenth of the whole
number. It will be the duty of the ensuing Congress to pass acts
similar to that passed this summer in reference to the district of
Columbia, ensuring to the loyal master compensation for the loss with
which he is menaced by the force of circumstances; it will be the no
less obvious duty of the people of these Border States cheerfully to
co-operate in their State with the President and Legislature, and to
do their part in the work of a social revolution, which, in their
cases at least, need not be attended by a single horror, while it must
be followed by a train of blessings.</p>

<p>We have given that precedence which is its due to the moral and
humanitarian view of the question. It is a secondary, but still an
important, consideration, whether the freed man will become a
cotton-grower. It was found in Jamaica that the free blacks took more
kindly to any other sort of labour than that which related to the
growth and manufacture of sugar, because the latter reminded them of
their ancient servitude. In the more recent experiments conducted
under the eye of General Hunter at Hilton Head, a similar repugnance
to the picking and ginning of cotton was found to exist among the
"contrabands" of South Carolina, and for similar reasons. Left to
their own impulses, they betook themselves exclusively to the
production of food. But it was also found that that repugnance was not
invincible. Kind treatment prevailed on them to submit to the
organisation and discipline necessary to the cultivation of cotton on
a large scale. This experiment was progressing so satisfactorily that
the Cabinet of Washington took the alarm and recalled the General who
patronised it. The miserable truckling policy, founded on the hope of
restoring the old slavery-protecting Union, has at length been
definitively abandoned, and henceforth every Federal commander must
take as his exemplar, not Butler and Stone, but Fremont, Hunter, and
Phelps.</p>

<p> In connection with this act of the 22nd of September it would be
unjust to omit mention of two names. Those names are William Lloyd
Garrison and John Brown. The moral-force agitation of the former, now
in the thirty-second year of its existence, is about to triumph. It is
his "unadorned eloquence," not the ornate generalisations of William
Henry Seward, which posterity will associate with this
proclamation. The same document adds new significance to the raid of
the martyr-fanatic of Harper's Ferry. In the Indian summer of 1859 the
genius of Emancipation was incarnated in the persons of John Brown and
his motley score of followers; in the autumn of 1862 her instrument is
the President of the United States, wielding the military and
financial resources of one of the richest and most powerful nations of
the earth.</p>

<p>The new policy should be welcomed even by those among us whose
sympathies on this occasion are with the slaveowner, for all parties
in England concur in the desire for the restoration of peace. The
policy of emancipation brings matters to a crisis. If the North can
ever subdue and occupy the South she will be able to do so now. If, on
the other hand, the resources and high spirit of the Southerners are
more than a match on their own territory for the Federal armies, then
the conviction of this fact will begin to dawn upon the North from
this day forth. Hitherto defeats, and disappointments more numerous
then defeats, have not shaken one jot of Northern resolution or
impaired their faith in their ultimate success. The secret of this
equanimity has been the knowledge that they held in reserve one of the
most effective weapons of war, which hitherto they had allowed the
enemy to wield against themselves. So long as this was the case a
military reverse was without moral or political significance to
them. Under the former conditions there was nothing to prevent the war
from dragging on for ten years. Expensive as all wars are, a
"Conservative" war is the most wasteful and profitless of
any. Henceforth the war becomes a revolutionary one. Revolutionary
wars, while they are impregnated with the bitterness partake also of
the shortness and decisiveness of civil revolutions. Burying its
guilty hopes of compromise, the North summons up its whole energies
for a supreme effort. The Confederates, with a heroism which we do not
seek to disparage, have held at bay the more populous and richer North
so long as they have been able to rely upon the uninterrupted labours
of their human chattels. Will they be able to do so when this prop is
knocked from under them? We know not; the future of the Union is
obscure, but one event is clear. The delicate and poisonous plant of
American slavery, if it be not torn up root and branch, will emerge
from the storm which now threatens its existence shorn of its once
luxuriant foliage and of most of the qualities which gave it so
baneful an ascendancy on the Western Continent, and therefore on the
whole civilised world. Should this be so, civilisation will receive a
solid permanent gain in compensation for some severe temporary losses
occasioned by the war of the second American Revolution.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamers City of Baltimore and Anglo-Saxon we
have received telegrams from New York to the evening of the 11th
inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>General M'Clellan, whose head-quarters are at Harper's Ferry, has
issued a general order to the troops respecting President Lincoln's
proclamation. He says:--<q>The fundamental rule of Republican
government is that armed forces are raised only to sustain the civil
authorities, and are to be held in strict subordination to them. The
discussion by officers and soldiers of Government measures, when
carried beyond a temperate expression of opinion, tends to destroy
discipline, by substituting political faction for that steady support
of Government which is the highest duty of the American soldier. In
carrying out the measures of the Government the army will be guided by
the same mercy and Christianity which have always controlled its
conduct towards the defenceless.</q></p>

<p>The Confederates, under General Stuart, have again crossed the
Potomac at Hancock, a town about thirty miles above Hagerstown. They
pushed forward through Maryland, and on the 10th occupied Mercersburg
and Chambersburg, in Pennsylvania. Their force is estimated at 3000
men, their advance consisting of 1000 cavalry and six pieces of
artillery. The inhabitants of these two towns had no means of
resistance. Chambersburg surrendered on the conditions that private
property should be respected, but that public property should be
removed or destroyed. The Confederates destroyed the Chambersburg
railway station, and carried off 500 horses. They were moving in the
direction of Gettysburg to destroy the bridge at that point and
prevent the approach of General M'Clellan's troops.</p>

<p>On the 8th a severe battle took place at Perrysville, forty miles
south of Frankfort, Kentucky, between General Bragg's and General
Buell's forces. The Federal loss is reported to have been 2000 in
killed and wounded, two Generals and a large number of officers being
among the former. General Buell reports that the engagement lasted
from 10 a.m. till dark. The enemy was repulsed, but not without some
momentary advantage on the left, The main body of the enemy fell back
in a southerly direction. General Buell adds, "Our loss is probably
pretty heavy, including valuable officers."</p>

<p>General Bragg has issued a proclamation urging the North-western
States to exercise their State sovereignty and make a separate treaty
of peace with the Confederates. He declares that the South will never
interfere with the free navigation of the Mississippi. He appeals to
them to desist from a war which can only, after greater sacrifices,
terminate in a treaty of peace.</p>

<p>The Confederates have evacuated Frankfort and Lexington, in
Kentucky.</p>

<p>The Confederates, under Generals Price and Van Dorn, attacked the
Federal General Rosencranz on the 3rd inst. at Corinth,
Mississippi. The fighting lasted two days. The Confederates succeeded
in reaching the main public square of Corinth, but new batteries were
opened upon them, and they retreated. General Rosencranz reported that
the rebels were repulsed with great slaughter. He says:--"The enemy is
in full retreat, leaving his dead and wounded: The loss is serious on
the Federal side, particularly in officers, but bears no comparison
with that of the enemy. Seven hundred Confederate prisoners captured."
The Federals also captured two batteries. The Confederates have been
driven back five miles across the Hatchie River.</p>

<p>The Federals have captured a battery on the St. John's River,
Florida, and cut off the retreat of a Georgia regiment.</p>

<p>There have been slight engagements in Missouri and South Eastern
Virginia.</p>

<p>The steamer Leopard has arrived at Nassau, New Providence, from
Charleston.</p><pb n="431"/>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>The majority of the Committee in the Senate has reported
resolutions that, after January next, Federal commissioned or
non-commissioned officers, when captured, shall be kept at hard labour
until the termination of the war or the repeal of President Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation. Federal white officers training or
commanding negroes in military enterprises against the Confederate
States, or inciting slaves to rebellion, or pretending to free them
under Lincoln's proclamation, shall, if captured, suffer death.</p>

<p>The State Legislature of Virginia has passed a resolution declaring
that no citizen shall be called to account for driving from the State
or putting to death any person who may be found aiding or abetting
Mr. Lincoln's proclamation.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal Government has abandoned the negro colonisation scheme,
the Ministers of the Central America Republics having protested
against the scheme being carried out in Central America.</p>

<p>The operation of the draught in New York State had been postponed
until the 11th. About 25,000 men are wanted to complete the call under
the second proclamation. Massachusetts is in arrear about 10,000
men. In Maine the conscription has been enforced, but each conscript
was allowed to call himself a volunteer and to receive the usual
bounty-money. In the other New England States the quotas have been
filled up by volunteering.</p>

<p>Mr. Cyrus Field has left New York for England, to conclude the
arrangements to lay the Atlantic cable in the summer of 1863.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Sumner addressed a large meeting in Faneuil Hall on the
6th inst. in support of the war, and in favour of the abolition of
slavery. Mr. George Francis Train attempted a reply on the slavery
question, but was refused a hearing and ultimately removed from the
platform in the custody of the police.</p>

<p>The Chicago <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says of the late wheat
harvest in the Western States:--<q>There can now be but little doubt
in the mind of an ordinary observer concerning the shortness of the
wheat crop throughout the North-Western States. In Illinois the crop
of winter wheat turns out to be sadly deficient in yield and very
inferior in quality. In the central counties of the state the berry is
shriveled and shrunken, and the average is not over one third of last
years yield. In the more northerly counties the yield is not over
seven bushels per acre on an average; and many fields were damaged to
such an extent by the "bug" that they were not worth cutting. In
Wisconsin the crop of wheat is also short. In the northerly counties
the quality is good, but the quantity is much below that of last
year's crop; while in the central and southern counties the wheat is
very deficient, both in quality and yield. In Iowa the quality will
average better than in Illinois and Southern Wisconsin; but the yield
is not over half of the crop of 1861. In Minnesota the crop is
excellent as to quality, and there is not much complaint about the
yield.</q></p>

<p>Gold has risen to 29 per cent premium.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Another</hi> change of scene in the ever-shifting melodrama of the
fratricidal war. We had scarcely had time to examine the details of
the last affair at Corinth, where it would seem that the Confederates,
after some very severe fighting and after penetrating into the heart
of the city, were gallantly repulsed, when we learn that there has
been one hard battle (not two) between Bragg and Buell, at
Perrysville, in Kentucky, the issue being undecided; and, further,
that the Confederates, under Stuart, have once more crossed the
Potomac, at Hancock, and gone over Maryland into Pennsylvania. This
invading body is represented to be small, not numbering more than
3000; and it is therefore uncertain whether the movement is a mere
demonstration or a feint, or whether it is to be followed up. New York
is declared to be "in the greatest astonishment." As Mr. Disraeli has
it in "Alarcos"--<q rend="center">The King's amazed?</q><q rend="center">Poor man!</q>
The Confederates had left Lexington and were moving towards Cumberland
Gap. M'Clellan claims a decided victory at Antietam, and, unlike
General Pope, is able to point to tangible witnesses of his success in
the form of fourteen guns and 6000 prisoners, an improvement upon
Pope's ideal captures. The commercial news is equally
interesting. Gold was at a very high premium, nearly at 28 per cent,
upon which fact it might be edifying to hear Mr. Chase. More
interesting still is the announcement that the Confederate Congress
were con-<pb n="435"/>sidering a resolution empowering the Davis
Government to buy or seize a million bales of cotton, and to send
agents to Europe to sell it. It is also proposed to repeal all laws
prohibiting the export of cotton from ports occupied by the enemy when
such cotton is bought by foreigners. Of course, there is no doubt that
willing purchasers will be found here for every pound of cotton that
can be delivered at Liverpool; but the risk must be that of the
venders. The friends of the North argue that this course indicates a
great lack of money on the part of the South. In all probability the
sinews of war will be found equally wanting on both sides; and, if the
South is desperately bent on selling cotton, Mr. Chase's greenbacks to
be exchanged for gold only at the frightful sacrifice that has been
mentioned (Austrian financiers of a few years back must be interested
in this state of things) does not say much for national confidence,
and there are not wanting those in America who talk very uneasily of
the possibility of peace being celebrated by a wholesale application
of the sponge. Influential Southerners are now demanding urgently that
a recognition shall take place, and some of the Northerns interpret
this as an intimation that the Confederates have had enough of
fighting; but the general tone of the South by no means favours this
idea.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Saxonia and City of Washington we have New
York journals of the 18th and telegrams, vi&#xE2; Cape Race, to the 21st
ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General M'Clellan's head-quarters are still at Harper's Ferry. On
the 16th two reconnaissances en force were made across the Potomac by
Generals Hancock and Woodbury. Having succeeded in ascertaining the
whereabouts of General Lee, the two divisions returned to Bolivar
Heights. General M'Clellan concludes his report thus:--"There is no
doubt that the rebel Generals intend to give battle at or near their
present location. The indications are that they will not have to wait
long before they again meet the army of the Potomac." It is, however,
stated that General M'Clellan's army is unable to advance on account
of short supplies of clothing and shoes for the troops.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Stuart made good his retreat into Virginia,
recrossing the Potomac at Edward's Ferry, carrying away 1000 horses
and large quantities of boots end clothing taken in
Pennsylvania. During this successful raid the Confederates passed
entirely round the army of the Potomac. The Confederates have
respected private houses, but have torn up the railway tracks and
damaged a considerable amount of Government property along their
route.</p>

<p>The Southern accounts of the battle of Perrysville, Kentucky, differ
from the Northern reports in claiming the victory and capture of 9000
Federal prisoners during the battle.</p>

<p>The Confederates, under General Morgan, captured Lexington,
Kentucky, and took 100 prisoners. He speedily evacuated the place, and
met the Federal forces, under General Dumont, between Versailles and
Frankfort. It is reported that after a short engagement the
Confederates scattered. Morgan afterwards captured a train of eighty
Federal waggons near Bardstown.</p>

<p>General Butler has left New Orleans to inspect the condition of
affairs at Pensacola. A Federal foraging expedition has been sent up
the Mississippi in transports. The expedition captured a quantity of
cattle, but eighteen men were killed on board the transports by the
Confederate batteries erected at the Levels. A free negro regiment has
been called out for service in New Orleans. Slavery has already been
abolished in and around New Orleans. The late slaves are now working
for their late masters as hired labourers.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The draught has been resisted in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Irish
miners of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, acted so riotously that the
military were called out and fired upon the insurgents, killing four
or five.</p>

<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions stating
that the destruction of the ship Brilliant by the Confederate steamer
Alabama is a crime against humanity. The Chamber of Commerce has not
failed to notice the change in British sentiments, transforming a
friendly nation into a Power the nature of whose neutrality is shown
by its permitting ships to go forth and armaments to follow them for
the work of plundering and destroying American vessels, thus
encouraging upon the high seas an offence against neutral rights, upon
the plea of which, in the case of the Trent, England threatened to
plunge the American Government into war. The Chamber has heard with
amazement that other vessels are fitting out in British ports to
continue the work of destruction begun by the Alabama. It is the duty
of the Chamber of Commerce to warn British merchants that a repetition
of such acts as burning the Brilliant, by vessels fitted out in
England and manned by British seamen, cannot fail to produce
widespread exasperation in America. The Chamber therefore invokes the
influence of all men who value peace and goodwill among all nations to
prevent the departure of other vessels of the same character from
their ports, and thus avoid the calamity of war. The resolutions close
by declaring that it is the desire and interest of Americans to
cherish and maintain sentiments of amity with England. Copies of the
resolutions are to be forwarded to the British Board of Trade. The
captures affected by the Alabama have injuriously affected the
freights for American shipping.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Davis, who recently assassinated General Nelson
in Louisville, Kentucky, has been released from arrest, and will
probably be ordered to duty soon.</p>

<p>The Democratic party throughout the Free States has taken ground
against the emancipation proclamation of the President and against the
suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. A letter from General Scott
to Mr. Lincoln, dated Marsh 2, 1861, has been brought out by
them. General Scott therein recommends that the "wayward sisters be
allowed to go in peace."</p>

<p>The Democrats on this platform have carried the States of Ohio and
Indiana. The Republicans have carried Iowa and fifteen out of
twenty-four members of Congress in Pennsylvania. It is yet uncertain
which party has carried the State ticket in the latter State.</p>

<p>The Sioux Indians in Minnesota had ceased hostilities and were
surrendering themselves to the Federal authorities.</p>

<p>Gold had risen to a premium of 32 per cent.</p></div2>

<p>Lord Lyons left Liverpool on Saturday last, in the mail steam-ship
Scotia, for Washington, where he will resume his duties as British
Minister. Among his fellow-passengers is Mr. S. Cameron, formerly
Federal Secretary for War. There has been a good deal of speculation
as to the nature of the instructions which his Excellency carries out
with him; but the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, in an article written
in a semi-official tone, warns us against any impression that an
immediate change is to take place in our position as regards the
Northern and Southern States, or that "Lord Lyons carries off in his
pocket instructions likely to lead to a crisis on his landing." Our
contemporary, indeed, has no doubt that "our intercourse with the
President's Government will remain as peaceful and uninterrupted as
the best friends of England and America could wish." The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> says:--"It is understood that Lord Lyons
takes out the most full assurance that, while England will be eager,
in concert with other civilised nations, to adopt any step that may
tend to promote a permanent return of peace, either through a
restoration of the Union on the old or any new basis, or on agreement
for a friendly separation, she will meanwhile individually refuse to
depart one hairsbreadth from her course of
non-interference."</p></div2>

principles recognised in the conduct of war. The Government of the

<p rend="center">LONDON: SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1862.</p>
<p>...American news is interesting, though as yet not very important. The
"feat of arms" of the war has been General Stuart's ride round General
M'Clellan's army. The gallant foraging party had it all their own
way--carried off horses, arms, clothing, and all that they required,
and, despite M'Clellan's threat that not one of them should escape,
all but one escaped, if the word be applicable to so triumphant a
raid. Another enemy has still more grievously disquieted the North,
the Alabama, which has made such havoc among the merchant-ships of the
Federals that the rate of freight is seriously affected and the
mercantile folks are scolding England for having allowed the Alabama
to fit out. The Confederates dashed at Lexington, and plundered, and
retreated, it is said, with loss. They claim Perrysville as a victory,
and say they can show 9000 prisoners. The army of M'Clellan was stated
to be advancing. But the civil struggle now waging is of more
importance as regards the war. The Democrats and Republicans are in
deadly close over the State elections, and should the former triumph
in the great States the Cabinet of Mr. Lincoln will reel and
totter. But the President hopes that the war fever will carry him
through. We may add to our American summary--for the matter has
principal reference to the war--that Mr. Cobden has delivered two long
speeches at Manchester and Rochdale, in which he strongly urges the
abandonment of the present maritime laws--that is to say, that England
should throw away the one terrible weapon which makes this little
island a match for the world in arms.</p></div2>

<p>Reconnaissances from General M'Clellan's army continue to be made,

<p>In the Western department, General Buell has relinquished the
pursuit of General Bragg, who has passed through Cumberland Gap into
East Tennessee. The Confederates carried large trains of provisions
out of Kentucky. The Southern journals declare that Bragg's invasion
of Kentucky was a failure, while the Northern newspapers denounced
General Buell for not having prevented Bragg's escape from that
State. These complaints have so much weight with President Lincoln as
to have impelled him to substitute General Rosencranz for General
Buell.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Nashville there has been a slight
engagement. The Federal General Negley reports that the Confederates
who had assembled at Lavergne, fifteen miles east from Nashville, with
the intention of assaulting the city, were attacked by the Federals on
the 6th and routed, leaving 170 prisoners. Nashville however, is
entirely cut off from communication with the North.</p>

<p>The British merchant-ship Blanche, sailing between the Mexican port
of Matamoras and Havannah, and carrying a cargo of cotton, was espied
and pursued near the latter port by Captain Hunter, in command of the
Federal gun-boat Montgomery. Instead of waiting for her the Blanche
endeavoured to escape. The Montgomery ran her ashore six miles north
of Moro Castle. The Alcalde, who had watched her movements from the
shore, went on board the Blanche and hoisted the Spanish flag as a
sign that she was under the protection of the Spanish Government. At
the same time Captain Hunter, of the Montgomery, ordered two boats
with armed men to board the Blanche and take possession of
her. Against these proceedings the Alcalde and the captain of the
Blanche protested. A quarrel ensued, in which the officer of the
Montgomery slapped the Spanish official in the face, and with the aid
of his men drove him and his three companions ashore. They then set
fire to the ship and carried away the Cuban pilot of the Blanche. When
the Spanish Governor at Havannah received the account of the affair,
orders were given to a Spanish frigate to sail forthwith and capture
the offending gun-boat. But the Montgomery had
disappeared. Mr. Tenara, the Spanish Minister at Washington, has laid
the matter before Mr. Seward. The result has been that the Federal
Secretary of the Navy has published his letter of instructions to the
naval officers, which goes to show that Captain Hunter acted solely on
his own responsibility.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.)</hi></p>
<p rend="right">Richmond, Virginia, Sept. 20.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">On</hi> my return to Richmond from the army
under General Lee, with drawings and material descriptive of the late
successes that have crowned the Confederate arms, I find to my great
disgust that a long letter forming the connecting link between my
campaign in the North and my visit South has been lost. This letter
was intrusted to a gentleman who proposed to run the blockade from
Charleston in the Lloyd's, and, unfortunately, while on his way to the
latter city he lost his portmanteau. The ship was on the point of
leaving and, sacrificing his baggage and my correspondence, he left in
her. I have just received a telegraphic despatch from Messrs. Frazier
and Co., the agents of the gentleman in question in Charleston, in
answer to one of my own inquiring about the safety of my letter,
acquainting me with the mishap, and also bringing me the intelligence
that the portmanteau has been traced and that they hope to have it
forwarded to them in time to leave by the next steamer. There is no
disguising the fact that my lines of communication are exceedingly
hazardous and that I am compelled to rely solely on the successful
running of the blockade--a postal arrangement which has very little
certainty in its operation. Some of my first sketches from the South
were lost in the broad current of the Potomac, the person who had them
in charge throwing them overboard with other papers while being chased
by a gun-boat.  Two or three of these I have redrawn, and I now send
them, in addition to others of the late battle on the plains of
Manassas. On the present occasion I have had to be my own courier as
far as here, and as soon as I see this packet safely off I shall
return to camp.*</p>

<p>The more I see of the Southern army the more I am lost in
admiration at its splendid patriotism, at its wonderful endurance, at
its utter disregard of hardships which, probably, no modern army has
been called upon to bear up against. Wretchedly equipped, the soldiers
of the Confederacy advance to meet their foes, the light of battle
shining on their countenances, determined to be victorious or die. I
have seen them marching over the hot and dusty roads of Virginia,
uniformless, shoeless, many with nothing but a thin, well-worn shirt
to shelter them from the scorching rays of the sun, and yet every man
cheered his comrade, and all as they dragged their bleeding feet along
made light of their sufferings, and with renewed elasticity strode
forward on their way, many to their graves. The lies I had heard in
the North of disaffection in the South have been refuted to me a
thousandfold. My own eyes and ears have contradicted at every step I
have taken the calumnies circulated to the prejudice of a people
firmly united in their desire for separation from the old Government,
and resolved to fight for their independence till the last man has
been called from his home and the last plantation laid waste. What a
grand picture does this colossal revolution present; how near to
heroism is this people brought, who, sacrificing everything--mothers
their sons, wives their husbands, all they hold dear--for that which
every country has fought for at some time during its history--its
rights! Yes, with all Europe against them--for are not the ports of
the Northern States open to the world?--these Saxons of the South,
blockaded in their harbours, with sorry arms, deprived of those
resources which alone make their enemy formidable, yet drive back the
countless legions of the invader from their soil, and with "Io
triomphe" on their tattered banners, prepare to carry the desolation
which they have suffered to the homes of their adversaries.</p>

<p>Surely your readers by this time have learned to properly estimate
the empty assurances and vain boastings of the Northern Government and
press in relation to the suppression of the rebellion. Mr. Seward's
circulars to the United States' Ministers abroad have been marvellous
specimens of promises on a promise to do something. At each additional
disaster to the Federal arms he has paraphrased in his despatches the
words of the popular song, "There's a good time coming, boys, <hi rend="italic"> only wait a little longer;</hi>" and for eighteen weary
months of bloodshed he has been singing this refrain, and each month
his voice has grown more uncertain and wavering in the notes. How long
England and France will submit to be bamboozled by the hollow
representations of the Federal Government remains to be seen; as it is
they have held aloof long enough, and precedents which they have
followed in other cases demand that the two Powers at the head of
civilisation should interfere to stop the butchery which disgraces the
century we live in. The call for six hundred thousand more men in the
North goes a long way to show that hitherto Mr. Seward has been
cheating Europe into the belief that the Southern revolt was
nothing. What has become of the first six hundred thousand? Their
bones lie whitening in the fields around Corinth; the plains of
Manassas are one huge Northern graveyard. From the James to the York
River, on the banks of the Chickahominy and the Pamunkey, the
slaughtered thousands of the once proud army of the Potomac sleep
their last sleep. And should Mr. Lincoln be successful in his demand
for new levies, which I very much doubt, the beginning of the end will
be as far off as ever. Surrounded as I am by the Southern people,
living in their midst, associating with their soldiers, I emphatically
assert the South can never be subjugated. There is not a mother with
two sons, having lost one by a Northern bullet, who will not freely
offer up the other on the altar of her country. As I have said before,
there are men serving in the ranks of the Southern army worth a
hundred thousand dollars (&#xA3;20,000) submitting to every privation--and
such privations were never known--and, if need be, they will continue
to bear with them and prolong the struggle for years. Never have I
heard a doubtful word expressed as to the ultimate result of the war
now waged by the Southerners: every soldier of the Confederacy is
impressed with the stamp of individuality, and has a confidence in
himself which half a million of Northerners cannot shake. And should
dire necessity demand that more blood should be shed in addition to
that which already crimsons the fields of Virginia, Kentucky, and
Tennessee, there will be five hundred thousand such men ready to form
a barricade with their bodies over which the invaders of their soil
will have to pass. We have seen the first great Northern army swept
away, and the second will scarcely fare better. The South is now
thoroughly aroused; the late victories that have crowned its arms have
made it more hopeful and determined than ever. The North, on the
contrary, is demoralised by a succession of reverses, which even the
mendacious despatches of its Generals have failed to conceal. The
whole Northern people are writhing under the disgrace of the continued
defeats of their well-equipped armies by, as they themselves term the
foe, a half-starved ragged mob of rebels. Will their past experience
in the war increase the prestige of their new levies in the field? It
is hardly probable. Their forces, beaten everywhere, cannot commence a
new campaign, even should they be permitted to do so by the European
Powers, without the dead weight of previous disaster exercising its
depressing influence upon them. However this may be, the South will be
found prepared, and, whatever the result, nobly, I am convinced, will
she stem the tide of battle. I would wish to continue this letter, and
give a comprehensive view to your readers of the social and political
policy of the South; but time is short, and I must delay to the next
opportunity the multitudinous facts that I have collected for the
benefit of your readers. Hoping this may reach you safely, I am yours
ever, F.V.</p>

<p>*A correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, writing from
the Confederate capital on Oct. 8, makes the following remarks in
reference to the blockade:--"It should be noticed, before leaving the
subject that, while four-fifths of the smuggling vessels on the
Potomac and two-thirds of the seagoing vessels on the coast are
invariably successful in their entrance to and exit from 'Dixie's
Land,' there are occasional seizures effected by Federal vessels,
which are made the most of by the New York press and in Mr. Seward's
despatches. As an instance, it may be mentioned that Mr. Vizetelly, the
well-known and popular correspondent of the <hi rend="smallcap">Illustrated London News</hi>, has been singularly
unfortunate in the despatches which during the last six weeks he has
addressed to England, and which have, without exception, been
subjected to moving accidents by flood and field. But the fact remains
that the South, though sorely vexed by the blockade, is penetrated and
reached by vessels every day and every night, and that, consequently,
there is no such scarcity as the Federal journals have loved to
paint."</p></div2>

<p>...The Northern States of America are engrossed with the State
elections, which appear to be going against Mr. Lincoln and his party
and in favour of the Democracy, which now claims to "command the
situation," and which repudiates and denounces the so-called abolition
proclamation. The members in course of election will have no
constitutional position for a year, but the public opinion manifested
by such a reaction as is alleged will have immediate and formidable
operation. The war news is almost <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>. M'Clellan does not advance; there is a rumour
that Halleck is to be removed from Washington to the west, and that
M'Clellan is to be succeeded by one who may or may not deserve the
title of "the judicious Hooker." The Confederate spoil in Kentucky has
been very large, but nothing beyond plunder has been gained by the
onslaught. Nashville is stated to be cut off by the Confederates, and
the North is still occupied with scolding England <hi rend="italic">in
re</hi> the terrible Alabama.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN OIL-WELLS.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> the columns of this Journal have been
given from time to time accounts of the wonderful oil-springs found in
the United States and in Canada, accompanied by conjectures as to how
the oil is produced--a point on which geologists are not
agreed. Sometimes the oil bubbles out on the top of streams, or rises
freely to the surface, bursting forth occasionally in jets several
feet high; but generally the oil is attained by sinking wells and
boring. These oil-springs at times catch fire, with, as may be
supposed, the most terrible results. One scene of the kind is thus
described by the <hi rend="italic">Buffalo Courier</hi>:--"During the
drilling of an oil-well at Tidione, Pennsylvania, a sudden rush of
oil, at the rate of seventy barrels an hour, took place, the stream
ascending 40ft. above the surface of the ground. Above this mass of
oil the gas or benzine rose in a cloud for 50 ft. or 60 ft. All the
fires in the neighbourhood were immediately extinguished, except one
400 yards distant. The fire from this ignited the floating gas, and in
a moment the whole air was in roaring flames. As soon as the gas took
fire the head of the jet of oil was in a furious blaze, and, falling
like water from a fountain over a space of 100 ft. in diameter, each
drop of oil came down a blazing globe of boiling oil. Instantly the
ground was in a flame, constantly increased and augmented by the
falling oil. At once a scene of indescribable horror took
place. Scores were thrown flat for a distance of 20 ft, and numbers
horribly burned, rushing blazing from the hell of misfortune,
shrieking and screaming in their anguish. The whole air was on
fire. The jet of oil, rushing up 40 ft., was almost a pillar of livid
flame, while the gas above it, to the distance of 100 ft., was
flashing, exploding, dashing towards the heavens, and apparently
licking the clouds with its furious tongues of heat. All this time,
during this tremendous combustion, the sounds of the explosions and
burnings were so tremendous and continuous that they could be compared
to nothing but the rushing of a hurricane or tornado through the
forest. The heat of the fire was so intense that no one could approach
within 150 ft. It was the most frightful and yet the grandest
pyrotechnical display ever vouchsafed to a human being. The oil burned
until it was exhausted."</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander S. Macrae, petroleum oilbroker, of Liverpool, has
obligingly furnished us with a photographic view of one of these oil
regions--the Spouting Wells at Oil Creek, Pennsylvania--from which we
give an Engraving at page 488. In the front of the Illustration is
shown a large vat, or cistern, in which a spouting well is running the
oil. Owing to the specific lightness of the petroleum it floats upon
the surface of water, and any deleterious matter which may be mixed
with it is at once precipitated to the bottom, whence it is readily
extricated. The oil is run into good strong forty-gallon casks, and
dispatched to the refineries at home, or exported to every port in
Europe. Phillips's Well is estimated to yield 3000 casks per
week. This time last year, writes Mr. Macrae, petroleum oil was almost
unknown in Europe, since which we have imported and consumed from
150,000 to 200,000 casks, representing more than half a million
sterling. The uses of this oil are many. In refining, spirits of
petroleum are produced, from which a turpentine substitute is made,
now being largely used in the place of spirits of turpentine. The next
and the most important derivative is the petroleum oil, used for
burning in paraffin-lamps. Lubricating oils and greases are likewise
extracted from it, and wax also in great quantities. In the United
States and Canada more than one hundred refineries have been
erected.</p></div2>

<p>General M'Clellan has moved his head-quarters to the Virginia side
of the Potomac. General Burnside has moved down along the eastern base
of the Blue Ridge Mountains and formed a junction with General
Siegel. The Federal General Stoneman has occupied Leesburg without
opposition. The Confederates are in front of the Federal advance.</p>

<p>General Pleasanton met the Confederates at Phillipmont. After
skirmishing they retreated to Union, whence they were subsequently
driven by General Pleasanton, who occupied the place. Heavy firing has
since been heard, but the result is not known.</p>

<p>The report we gave currency to last week concerning the suppression
of General M'Clellan and the assumption by General Halleck of the
command of the Department of the West was unfounded. No important

<p>General Curtis reports that the Confederates have been routed in
Arkansas.</p>

<p>The Federals have destroyed the extensive steam saltworks erected
by the Confederates at St. Joseph's Bay, Florida. Georgia and Florida
relied upon these works for the supply of salt for the winter's
provision for their troops.</p>

<p>In the extreme south-west some important operations have taken
place. Sabine City and Pass, at the mouth of the Sabine River,
dividing Louisiana from Texas, have been taken possession of by the
Federals. Galveston also, the chief port of Texas, has surrendered to
the Union Commander without resistance, and is now occupied by Federal
troops. A considerable contraband trade with England and the West
Indies has thus been put an end to.</p>

<p>A large naval and military expedition is now being fitted out for
Texas. The expedition is to be commanded by General Banks.</p>

<p>The Federal cruisers have captured the British steamers Anglia,
Scotia, and Wachuta.</p>

<p>The Confederate steamer Alabama has captured eight more American
vessels, and destroyed them all but two, which gave bonds for 86,000
dols., payable to President Davis after the declaration of peace. The
Alabama was last seen in lat. 39, long. 69 W., off Cape Delaware,
directly in the track of the Californian steamers.</p>

<p rend="center">DESPATCH OF THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT ON MEDIATION</p>
<p rend="center">IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>Thursday's <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> publishes a despatch of
M. Drouyn de Lhuys, dated Oct. 30, proposing to the Cabinets of London
and St. Petersburg to come to an understanding in order to cause a
suspension of the hostilities now waging on the American
continent. The Minister recalls that France has considered it a duty
to observe a strict neutrality, and continues:--"But, far from
imposing upon the Powers an attitude resembling indifference,
neutrality should dispose them to render themselves useful to both
parties, and aid them to emerge from a position which at present
appears without issue." The despatch proceeds to state that the
situation of the belligerents does not permit a hope of marked
advantage likely to accelerate the conclusion of peace, but points out
the opportunity for an armistice to which in the present state of
things no strategic interests appear to make an obstacle. M. Drouyn de
Lhuys continues thus:--"Dispositions favourable to peace begin to
manifest themselves in the North as well as in the South, and would
second steps for the conclusion of a truce. The Emperor has charged me
to propose to the Cabinets of London and St. Petersburg to come to an
understanding to employ their influence at Washington and in the
Confederate States in order to bring about a suspension of hostilities
for six months, during which all direct or indirect acts of war should
cease both sea and land. These overtures would imply no judgment upon
the origin or issue of the quarrel, and no pressure upon negotiations
which might be conducted. Our part would solely be to smooth away
difficulties, and only to intervene in the measures determined upon by
both parties. The accord of the three Powers would impress the steps
they might take with an evident character of impartiality. If our
counsels were not listened to we should have fulfilled the duties of
humanity, and even in remaining without result our efforts would not
be entirely useless, for they might encourage in American public
opinion a movement towards conciliatory ideas, and assist in hastening
the moment when the return of peace might become possible."</p>

<p>The question of European intervention in America is believed to
have met with slight encouragement from Russia. The official <hi rend="italic">Journal of St. Petersburg</hi> publishes the following
statement:--"We believe that the foreign Powers have no right whatever
to interfere in America. We also believe that no other intervention
would be possible than one similar to the advice which Russia has

Saturday, November</hi> 15, 1862.</hi></p>

<p>...The Emperor of the French is desirous that England and Russia
should join him in proposing a suspension of hostilities between the
belligerent Powers in America. A despatch from M. Drouyn de Lhuys to
these two Powers appears in Thursday's <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, in which he states that "the Emperor has
charged him to propose to the Cabinets of London and St. Petersburg to
come to an understanding to employ their influence at Washington and
in the Confederate States in order to bring about a suspension of
hostilities for six months, during which all direct or indirect acts
of war should cease both on sea and land." This amounts to so complete
a recognition and consolidation of the South that the North would be
justified in the most brusque rejection of such a proposal. It is not
likely, however, that they will have the opportunity of rejecting
it. The proposition is believed to have met with but slight
encouragement from Russia; and it is to be hoped that our own
Government, notwithstanding considerable temptation to accede to it,
will decline the Emperor's proposal.</p>

<p>The elections in America are still going against the Republicans,
whose wrath is being displayed in violent speeches and in an
indorsement of the "crushing" measures called for the extremes of
party. A defeat of the Federal General Mitchell is the only military
incident of note[.] We should add that it has been deemed expedient to
disavow the naval feat which has given such justifiable offence to
Spain, and the emulation of Wilkes is to be punished, on the demand of
the Spanish Government.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">It</hi> was announced in our last Impression
that we had received several illustrations in connection with the war
in America from our Special Artist at Richmond, Virginia. Some of
these appear in this week's Number.</p>

<p>"The Last Stand made by the Federals at Manassas," engraved on
pages 516-517, refers to the last disastrous days of the command of
the vainglorious Pope, when the Federals were driven back from the
Rapidan upon Arlington Heights opposite Washington. Our Artist writes
hereupon:--"The Yankee army, towards the close of the day, sought
refuge in a gully near the Alexandria and Orange Railroad. For some
hours they fought against the Confederates, who used stones and rocks,
their ammunition being exhausted. The Confederates kept the Federals
off, and eventually remained masters of the field. The Engraving shows
the division of General Longstreet charging with the bayonet against
the masses assembled to stay the triumphant progress of the Southern
arms."</p>

<p>The "View of Richmond from the West," on the same pages, shows the
picturesque site of this city, climbing as it does the hills which
skirt the north bank of the James River. The railroad bridge given in
the Engraving connects the city with its chief suburb, Manchester.</p>

<p>"Drury's Bluff," depicted above, is on the James River. It was here
that the Confederate batteries and obstructions forced the two Federal
iron-clads the Monitor and Galena to retire to their station at
Harrison's Landing. Drury's Bluff is within eight miles of the
Confederate capital. The line of stakes planted across the river
represents the nature of the obstructions with which the Confederate
engineers have covered the approach to Richmond by water.</p>

<p>On the preceding page we engrave the "Camp of the Confederate
Marines at Drury's Bluff," stated by our Artist to be one of the most
important posts of the Confederates.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ALABAMA ("290").</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> Confederate screw-steamer Alabama,
Captain Semmes, an Engraving of which is given on page 513, is the
notorious vessel whose doings on the Newfoundland banks have
frightened Northern merchants out of their propriety and occasioned a
remonstrance from the New York Chamber of Commerce, addressed to
British merchants. The Alabama, formerly the 290, was built in
Mr. Laird's yard at Birkenhead. She is a wooden vessel of 1200 tons
burden, copper-bottomed, 2l0 ft. long, rather narrow, painted black
outside, carries three long 32-pounders on a side, has a 100-pounder
rifled pivot-gun forward of the bridge, and a 68-pounder on the
main-deck. These are of the  Blakeley pattern, made by Wesley and
Preston, of Liverpool. She is barque-rigged, and is represented to go
thirteen knots under under sail and fifteen under steam. She sailed
from the Mersey in August. Her officers are Americans, but her present
crew are Englishmen. Captain Semmes was the dashing commander of the
Confederate steamer Sumter. The Alabama is, we believe, the only
vessel which the Confederate States now have on the high seas.</p>

<p>It is said that Mr. Collier, Q.C., as well as the Attorney and
Solicitor General, have given opinions that her sailing so armed and on
such an errand as hers was a breach of the Queen's proclamation of
neutrality.</p>

<p>Our Engraving on page 513 is from a sketch by Mr. W. Woods, of
Liverpool, and represents the Alabama leaving the Tonowanda after
having put on board that vessel the captains and crews of several
Federal merchantmen which she had taken as prizes and burnt. The ship
Tonowanda, which recently arrived at Liverpool from Philadelphia,
reports that she was captured by the Alabama (290) on the 9th of
October at 4 p.m., in lat. 41, long. 55. Captain Julius was taken on
board, and found there Captain Harmon and crew, of the late barque
Wave Crest, from New York for Cardiff, and Captain Johnson and crew,
of the late brig Dunkirk, from New York for Lisbon, all prisoners and
in irons on deck, their vessels having been burnt two days
previous. The next day the prisoners were transferred to the
Tonowanda, and Captain Julius alone remained on board the Alabama as
hostage. On the 11th of October they captured and burnt the ship
Manchester, from New York for Liverpool. Her captain and crew were
also put on board the Tonowanda. No more prizes were taken till the
evening of the 13th, and, there being every appearance of thick
weather, Captain Julius was put on board the Tonowanda and allowed to
proceed, after having given a ransom bond. All the captains, officers,
and crews are parolled prisoners of war.</p>

<p>In reply to a communication of Mr. Chilton, chairman of the
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, to the Government, requesting to know
the opinion of the Government on the Manchester and <sic corr="Tonowanda">Tonawanda</sic>seizures,
and the position of the owners of the British property on  board,
Mr. Chilton has received a note stating that the communication of the
chamber has been received and is under the consideration of her
Majesty's Ministers.</p></div2>

of the 8th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General M'Clellan's army has again advanced into Virginia along the
left side of the Blue Ridge. All the approaches to Manassas are in
possession of the Federals. They also occupy Warrenton. The Federals
have received no information of the position or movements of General
Lee's army.</p>

<p>An expedition, consisting of 12,000 men and several gun-boats, has
left Newbern, North Carolina. Its destination is unknown.</p>

<p>A Philadelphia paper contains a letter from its correspondent in
North Carolina stating that 3000 Confederates had surrendered
unconditionally to General Foster's expedition at Plymouth, North
Carolina.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward has disavowed the act of the Commander of the United
States' steam-ship Adirondack in continuing the chase of the British
ship Herald when she was within the maritime jurisdiction of the
Island of New Providence. The act is spoken of as "an inexcusable
violation of the law of nations, for which acknowledgment and
reparation ought to be promptly made."</p>

<p>On the 18th of October ten Confederate prisoners were shot at
Palmyra, Missouri, in accordance with the orders issued by General
M'Niel. Porter's guerrillas had carried off some days previously one
Andrew Allsman, from Palmyra, and General M'Niel promptly gave notice
that if he were not returned to his family within ten days ten
prisoners should be shot. Mr. Allsman was not forthcoming, and General
M'Niel executed his threat.</p>

<p>The Federals have lately lost two Generals. General 0. M. Mitchell,
the ex-astronomer and Abolitionist, died at Beaufort, South Carolina,
on the 31st ult., of yellow fever. General Richardson died of the
wounds received at the battle of Antietam. General Mitchell had
control of the freed negro establishment in South Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Alabama.</hi></p>
<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has appointed a committee to take
measures for capturing the Alabama. A letter from Mr. Seward was read,
acknowledging the receipt of the resolutions of the Chamber of
Commerce concerning the destruction of American vessels by pirates,
who, he says, are sent from the shores of a friendly nation in
violation of the restrictions of municipal and international
laws. Mr. Seward further says that he has directed the attention of
the American Minister in London to the subject.</p>

<p>The owners of the barque Laureata, which was burned by the
Confederate steamer Alabama, have protested before the British and
Portuguese Consuls in New York, on the ground that their European
nationality was certified by the Consuls' certificates, which were
shown to Captain Semmes.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi> states that the order of
the Secretary of War to enrol conscripts between eighteen and
forty-five years of age is unpopular, if not odious, among a large
class of the Southern people.</p>

<p>Horatio Seymour, the Democratic candidate for Governor, has been
elected in the State of New York by a majority of 10,000 votes. The
cities of New York and Brooklyn gave him 40,000 majority. In the
State, nineteen Democrats and twelve Republicans were elected to
Congress. The adjoining State of New Jersey voted the Democratic
ticket by a large majority. In Illinois, the President's State, the
Democrats have obtained a majority of 15,000. On the other hand,
Governor Andrew and the Republicans have triumphed in Massachusetts,
although Boston, like the other large cities, voted for the
Opposition. This ensures the re-election to the Senate of Mr. Charles
Sumner. In Michigan the Republicans have also triumphed. In Wisconsin
the numbers are so close that it is as yet impossible to say which
party has gained the day. The Republicans attribute their defeat to
the absence of their voters at the seat of war and to the popular
discontent at the inaction of General M'Clellan. The elections were
conducted without disorder.</p>

<p>A three hours' discussion on the negro question has been held in
the Cooper Institute, New York, between George Francis Train and
Major-General Cassius Clay. The former took the pro-slavery and the
latter the anti-slavery side. The audience was about equally divided;
but Mr. Train's superior debating power gave him the advantage on the
rostrum.</p>

<p>General suggestions are being put forward to send from New York
voluntary contributions, in cargoes of grain, for the relief of
distress in Lancashire.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE PROPOSED MEDIATION IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Her Majesty's Government</hi> have published
the reply which they have returned to the French despatch proposing a
joint offer of mediation in America. We gave in our Town Edition last
week an abstract of this able State paper. It deals perspicuously with
the reasons assigned in the despatch of M. Drouyn de Lhuys. Earl
Russell recognises the good intentions of the Emperor in making his
offer, and he agrees with him that in any measure of the kind which it
may be desirable to adopt it is extremely desirable that Russia
should he associated with England and France. Up to the present time,
however, the Queen's Government have not been informed that the
Government of Russia have agreed to co-operate with the Western
maritime Powers for the purpose of mediation. The first and chief
question, however, is--Whether the proposed end can be accomplished in
the way indicated by the French Emperor? Her Majesty's Government have
deliberated anxiously on this subject, and, after weighing all the
information which they have received from America, they are led to the
conclusion that there is no ground at the present moment to hope that
the Federal Government would accept the proposal suggested; and a
refusal from Washington, it is remarked, would prevent any speedy
renewal of the offer. The course which appears best in the eyes of the
British Government is, to watch carefully the progress of opinion in
America, and to take advantage of the first favourable opportunity
offered by a change to tender friendly counsel.</p>

<p>Prince Gortschakoff's reply to the note of M. Drouyn de Lhuys has
been published in the <hi rend="italic">St. Petersburg
Journal</hi>. Russia also declines to enter on the proposed combined
measure of mediation, on the ground that if presented in an official
character there would be a risk of arriving at a result opposed to
pacification. Prince Gortschakoff promises, however, that if France
and England should agree in a combined action the Russian Government
will lend, if not official aid, at least its moral support in favour
of their efforts.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> says the replies of the
Cabinets of London and St. Petersburg are a mere adjournment of the
question of mediation, based on the internal position of America, and
expresses its belief that the hesitation of the two Cabinets has
nearly reached its limit.</p></div2>

<p>...We do not suppose that any offence has been given to the French
Government by the refusal of Lord Russell to interfere in the American
struggle. Doubtless the Emperor knew beforehand that his application
would be made in vain. The despatches have been promptly published,
and the French press affects to treat our reply as a mere
postponement. We shall look curiously to see how it is received in
America. In all probability it will be interpreted as an indication of
our malicious wish that the war should go on, or else we shall be
complimented upon our prudence in not taking the liberty of advising
the cessation of a war which we notoriously stirred up and are feeding
with the gold of our aristocracy. Meantime there is not any American
news of interest except the reports as to the elections, the principal
one--that for New York--having resulted in a grand triumph for those
who in an American sense may he called Conservatives. Other victories
have also fallen to the Democrats, and their antagonists are driven to
exult in the fact that, let public opinion be what it may, Mr. Lincoln
and his friends are irremovable. There are, however, rumours of
Ministerial changes. General M'Clellan was advancing at last and
pouring his force into Virginia, the Confederates apparently making
but slight resistance. They may have chosen their own
battle-ground. The Alabama continued to sink[,] burn, and destroy, and to
excite something more than indignation in the North, which called on
the Government to send out a strong naval force to capture her. If, as
is reported, she has been burning an English vessel, it is not
improbable that orders to our own squadron may save Mr. Lincoln some
trouble.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S COUP-D'ETAT.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">It</hi> is with some reason supposed that there
is a growing body of persons in the States of America which looks at
every political and military movement of either of the contending
parties from what may be called a mediation point of view. But it is
quite certain that in this country every one, whatever may be his
proclivities, whether he inclines to the North or to the South scans
eagerly every act of importance which is reported in order, if
possible, to extract from it some hope, however faint or remote, of a
pause in the terribly sanguinary arbitrement to which the differences
between Federals and Confederates have been referred. To say the
truth, the news of American battles has lost much of its interest,
since it has been invariably found that nothing decisive ever comes of
them, and that mankind in general are by no means accurately informed
as to which side even ostensible victory has inclined. Many of those
who must gather their opinions from such accounts as they receive of
stricken fields are now apt to think that the resultless character of
this internecine war has become confirmed, and that the questions
involved are not very likely to be soon settled by the rude process of
fighting. It is, therefore, not <pb n="566"/>surprising that more
attention has been recently fixed on the elections which have been
going on in the Federal States, and which are a kind of battles that
Englishmen of the present generation understand better than the
gladiatorial combats of hundreds of thousands of armed men, the object
of which seems to be, or at least the result of which is, only the
slaughter of so many of the combatants on either side. It is quite
intelligible how the return to Congress and to the offices and
Legislatures of the different Federal States of men who belong to a
party which, if it has a creed, is opposed, we will not say to the
policy, for that word in the sense in which we use it is hardly
expressive of the sources of political movement in America, but to the
personal presence in the Presidential chair of Mr. Lincoln, would seem
to us on this side of the water to have assumed the aspect of a vote
of want of confidence in the Government. In our own more concentrated
mode of conducting the business of the State this would have been done
by a vote of the House of Commons directed against the Ministry in
office, and would have brought new men into their places and raised
hopes of the inauguration of a new policy. There is, however, no means
that we know of by which a President of the United States can be
called on to resign because of the expression of opinion by an
elective majority condemnatory of his mode of conducting the affairs
of the country. No such sudden fall from power can come on Mr. Lincoln
except by his own act or by the exercise of something akin to physical
force. But it would be very strange if the fact of strong reaction in
public opinion, as indicated by a series of elections carried on
avowedly on the principle of Lincolnism or no Lincolnism, did not
create an uneasy sense of insecurity at Washington. There has been,
doubtless, due counsel taken by the President and his advisers as to
how they might best guard themselves from the danger which threatens
them. In such a case one of the first steps taken by men who, in a
certain sense, are beleaguered, is to eject from amongst them any of
their number who, wielding power, are not deemed heart-whole in their
cause. This is one of the first symptoms of preparation for defence,
and it has not been wanting in the care of the Executive at
Washington. The first symptom of alarm has been duly exhibited by the
deposition of General M'Clellan from the command of the army in the
field, which is really face to face with the Southern forces, a
circumstance which would have been of little consequence before the
recent elections, but which now is full of significance.</p>

<p>This act, if it means anything, signifies that the authorities at
Washington are conscious that the party of which they are the
representatives is no longer triumphant, and that while Mr. Lincoln
continues to hold power, it may be in defiance of opinion, it is
necessary that he should use it in every way for the purposes and the
support of the cause of which he is the outward and visible sign. We
in this country are generally in a somewhat foggy state on the subject
of American parties; and few of us comprehend exactly what is meant by
the terms Republican and Democrat. If the latter is interpreted by the
word Conservatism we believe it goes as near to its meaning as it can
be brought; but it has a strange sound to our ears when used in that
sense. It would seem, however, that the Democrats are the party of law
and order; earnest for the preservation of the Union, if it can be
preserved by legitimate and constitutional means; and up to the
present time they have not been opposed to war as a means of
conserving the grand federation of the United States. The Republicans,
as we understand them, are abolitionists of slavery and Unionists at
any cost and by any means, and therefore they are supporters of all
the recent acts of the Executive at Washington, which have made
Old-World despotism and European states of siege hide their diminished
heads. Hitherto, the Democrats have not been a peace party; but it is
believed that they are fast coming to that conclusion, and are--we
will mot say drifting--but being driven into the consciousness that
separation between North and South is inevitable, and that it would be
better to yield their wishes for the totality of the Union in order
that anarchy might not become chronic in their country.</p>

<p>To the Democrat party General M'Clellan avowedly belongs.  When he
took the command-in-chief of the army of the North such a position was
quite consistent with the principles of his party, and he might well
have believed that he was best serving its views by endeavouring to
create an army out of the armed mob which he found at
Washington. Whatever other merit may be denied him, and we do not
profess to hold his qualitie[s] as a General in the field at all high, at
least he must be allowed the credit of having done much towards that
organisation of a huge mass of men called an army, the absence of
which in general has been the main element of all the disaster of this
unhappy war. But it was not unreasonable for the President and his
advisers to suppose that the change which had come over M'Clellan's
party would reach him, and this at the most critical moment of the
contest. In fact, it is on all hands allowed that he held the issue of
the struggle in his hands; and that, once more in the history of the
world, the General of an army might have been the arbiter of the
fortunes of his country. That an attempt to remove him from his
command should have been made is not surprising; and the moral courage
which dictated and carried it out is not undeserving of
admiration.</p>

<p>The case of the Republicans against M'Clellan, however, goes
further than that which we have stated above. They say that, as a
politician, his sympathies have always been with the South, and that he
has believed that party wronged by Northern sentiment and Northern
action; that he hoped and believed that a time would come when the war
could be arrested, and when the Southern leaders, backed by a powerful
party in the Northern States, would listen to terms of accommodation;
and that nothing would stand in the way of such a compromise more than
a victory which should crush the power of the South. Hence his
dilatory proceedings, his apparent dallying with the war, his
reluctance to measure his strength at all opportunities with the foe
before him, and the conduct of the campaign in Virginia, which ended
in the withdrawal of the Northern troops from aggressive action in the
territory of their opponents. In short, the accusation must be summed
up in the simple phrase that M'Clellan was a traitor. For our own
part, we believe nothing so decided of him. He is a mediocre man, a
doctrinaire in a military as well as a political sense, who might have
been well employed in drilling recruits at Washington, but who was
wholly unfitted by temperament or quality to be placed in the
situation of a General on whose activity, resource, and military
genius so much depended.</p>

<p>It is true that the extreme section of the Northern party has long
been demanding his deposition from the command of the army of the
Potomac; and it may be true that on more than one occasion the
President has personally written to his General, remonstrating with
him for his military conduct; and there may also be truth in the
statement of General Halleck, of something like positive disobedience
to orders by M'Clellan, and which is put forward as the ostensible
reason of his recall; but there are few impartial persons who will not
hold that the real cause of his removal lies deeper, and that the
sudden action of the President has been prompted by a very excusable
alarm at the turn which political affairs have taken. If all that is
stated be fact, the President was long ago satisfied that M'Clellan
ought to be removed, and, if so,his being retained could only have
been a temporising with that feeling of insecurity which has
culminated in an act almost of desperation. The quiet submission of
M'Clellan to his relegation, with something of ignominy, into private
life, when, if his partisans are to be credited, he might have set
himself up as a military dictator and brought the affairs of his
country to a settlement, is characteristic of the man, whom a mixture
of constitutional principle and timidity renders wholly unequal to the
adopting of the part which has been played before now in the civil
convulsions of a nation by the head of an army. Despite of some
peculiarly American talk with regard to him, we venture to prophecy
that the world has heard the last of M'Clellan as a public man.</p>

<p>The appointment of General Burnside to the command of the Northern
army is perhaps the best that could be made. He is by profession a
soldier, and he has been tolerably successful in some small affairs in
which he has been engaged. But, whatever his military capabilities may
be, what seems to be certain is that he has undertaken the command of
the army of the Potomac on the condition of meeting the enemy in the
field; that his tactics are to be the opposite of those of his
predecessor. It seems likely, therefore, that ere long a state of
things will be attained in which the small voice of reason and of good
sense, which is very faintly heard in America now, will swell into a
demand for peace and negotiation. We hear that that peculiar season of
the American continent which is called the Indian summer has arrived,
and it will afford opportunity for General Burnside to do anything he
proposes to do; and if a great battle is fought, whatever may be its
result in a military sense, we have a confident hope that its effects
on the public mind in the States will be what we should call
satisfactory--that is, it will produce such a pause in the action of
the war as to allow the suggestions of reason and common sense to be
listened to, coming, as they will, from an unlooked for
quarter--namely, from the majority of the American people themselves.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Bohemian we are in receipt of
telegrams from New York to the evening of the 14th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>On the 7th inst. the order relieving General M'Clellan from the
command of the Army of the Potomac was received at head-quarters. The
order was delivered to the displaced General by General
Buckingham. On its receipt the command was handed over to General
Burnside. On retiring he issued the following farewell
order:--<q>Officers and Soldiers of the Army of the Potomac,--An order
of the President devolves upon Major-General Burnside the command of
this army. In parting with you I cannot express the love and gratitude
I bear to you. As an army you have grown up under my care. In you I
have never found doubt or coldness. The battles you have fought under
my command will proudly live in our nation's history. The glory you
have achieved, our mutual perils and fatigues, the graves of our
comrades fallen in battle and by disease, the broken forms of those
whom wounds and sickness have disabled, the strongest associations
which can exist among men, unite us still by an indissoluble tie. We
shall ever be comrades in supporting the Constitution of our country
and the nationality of its people.</q></p>

<p>The army made no particular demonstrations in behalf of its late
Commander. On reaching Warrenton Junction, the troops crowded round
him and demanded a few parting words. He said, in response to this
appeal, "I wish you to stand by General Burnside as you have stood by
me, and all will be well. Good-by." General M'Clellan retires from
active service, and intends to reside at Trenton, New Jersey. On his
way thither he was everywhere received with marks of approval. Large
numbers of persons have gone to Trenton to pay their respects to the
General. At a serenade given in his honour he made a speech, in which
he said that whilst the army was fighting the citizens should see that
the war was prosecuted for the preservation of the Union, the
Constitution, and their own nationality and rights. Two of his Staff
officers have been arrested and sent to Washington. The charges
against them are unknown.</p>

<p>General Burnside, the new Commander, is a Rhode Islander, about
forty-one years of age, and a Democrat in politics. The Republican
journals pronounce themselves in favour of the change; but the
Democratic organs and party regard M'Clellan as a victim. General
Burnside has issued an address to the army, in which he says he
accepts the command with diffidence, but with confidence in the
patriotism of the army. His army has already advanced to Fayetteville,
four miles from Rappahannock station.</p>

<p>In order to strengthen the grounds for M'Clellan's removal a
correspondence between General Halleck and the Secretary of War has
been published, in which the former states that he issued peremptory
orders to General M'Clellan on the 6th of October to cross the Potomac
and give battle to the enemy or drive him south. General M'Clellan did
not obey this order, on the ground that he was short of
supplies. General Halleck and Quartermaster-General Meigs assert that
General M'Clellan's requisitions were promptly supplied, and that
there was nothing to prevent him advancing. The Harper's Ferry
Investigating Committee have censured M'Clellan for marching only six
miles a day in pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p>No confirmation has been received of the reported surrender of 3000
Confederates at Plymouth, North Carolina.</p>

<p>Over 300 Sioux Indians have been convicted by the military
commission as participators in the late massacres, and are condemned
to be hanged. Whether they live or die rests with the authorities at
Washington. The people of Minnesota, to a man, are in favour of their
immediate execution.</p>

<p>The report of iron-clad vessels being built in England for the
Confederates has aroused apprehensions for the safety of New York
harbour. Measures are being taken for its security.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Georgia announces that the union of the diocese of

<p>General Fremont has been ordered to report himself for duty.</p>

<p>Archbishop Hughes has written a letter to Mr. Seward, in which he
says that America should be prepared, for there is no love for her on
the other side of the Atlantic. Generally speaking, he says, the
United States are ignored, if not despised, in Europe; treated of in
conversation in the same contemptuous language that Americans might
employ towards the inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands or Vancouver
Island.</p></div2>

after a five years' absence. He has been employed in constructing a
military and emigrant road from the head waters of the Columbia River
to those of the Missouri, across the Rocky Mountains and through the
territories of Washington and Dacotah. The road passes through large

Captain Semmes, whose portrait, engraved from photograph furnished us

Captain Semmes was an officer of a subordinate grade (a lieutenant, we
believe) in the United States' naval service. He is a man about fifty
years of age, spare in person, and possessed of a large share of
activity, so essential for one engaged in hazardous enterprises such
as his are.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer City of Baltimore we have telegrams
to the evening of the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Burnside, after consulting with General Halleck, has
determined to advance on Richmond by way of Fredericksburg. His army
occupies the north side of the Rappahannock, confronted by the
Confederates on the south bank. General Sumner has demanded from the
Mayor the surrender of the city, and insisted that the inhabitants
should cease aiding the Confederates. He declared that if the city was
not surrendered in sixteen hours he should shell it. The municipality
replied that the inhabitants would cease assisting the Confederates,
but would not surrender the city. They also complained of the short
time allowed for the removal of women and children. The Confederate
General Longstreet is encamped outside Fredericksburg, and a battle is
expected for possession of the city. The Confederates are planting
batteries along the south side of the Rappahannock to prevent the
Federals from crossing.</p>

<p>The roads in Virginia are in bad condition, owing to the recent
copious rains.</p>

<p>General Burnside has officially informed the War Department that no
resignations of officers in the old army of General M'Clellan had been
tendered, and that everything is going on as smoothly as could be
expected.</p>

<p>Accounts from Kansas and Florida give details of engagements
between the rebels and United States' negro troops, in which the
latter behaved with distinguished coolness and courage, and achieved
decided successes. The result of these experimental fights is very
encouraging to the Federal Government.</p>

<p>General Butler had visited the British steamer Rinaldo, at New
Orleans. A brisk engagement has occurred above Brashear City, up the
River Teche, in Louisiana, between Federal and Confederate gun-boats,
the latter assisted by batteries on the shore.</p>

<p>The Southern journals state that the Federals attacked St. Mary's,
Georgia, but were repulsed. The Federals, being unable to land,
destroyed the town by gun-boats.</p>

<p>The steamer California, with a cargo of cotton from Mobile, has
been captured by Federal cruisers. The steamer Kate has arrived at
Nassau with a cargo of cotton.</p>

<p>Upwards of a hundred thousand Federal troops are on the
sick-list. The Southern journals estimate the Confederate loss by
disease and battles, during the last ten months, at 75,000 men.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Emancipation In
Louisiana.</hi></p>

<p>A letter from New Orleans to the editor of the New York <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, dated the 8th ult., writes thus of the state
of the negro population in Louisiana:--<pb n="591"/><q>The appearance
of the Federal troops has put an end to all work among the negroes,
and sent a majority of the planters flying for their lives with
undisguised fear. A few remain and welcome the Federal troops; but the
negroes, unfortunately, are demoralised by the example around them,
and the loyal proprietors suffer with the rest.</q></p>

<p>The same letter records that when a Federal expedition advanced to
Donaldsonville, eighty miles from New Orleans by the Mississippi, and
thence to Thibodeau, thirty miles up the Latouche, Mrs. Bragg (wife of
the Confederate General), who had been left alone on the  plantation
belonging to her husband, sent word to Lieut.-Colonel Warner that she
would like a guard to protect her property from devastation. The
request was complied with, but the guard arrived too late. The
knowledge that the Federals were coming had reached the negroes on the
estate, and they took advantage of the opportunity to break open the
closets, invade the bureaus, rip open the feather and moss beds in
search of treasure, and otherwise destroy the furniture in the various
rooms. Another letter says:--<q>I was on the river yesterday, visiting
several large plantations, whence every negro had run away, after
pillaging his master's plantation and house. Ruin was
everywhere. Allen had 350 negroes, of whom not one remains, and of
course the standing canes will all be lost. So with every plantation
in the vicinity. . . .  Across the bayou, opposite our camp, there is
a most remarkable and picturesque assemblage of over 3000 negroes, of
all sizes, ages, and tints. There they are holding high
carnival. Having seized their masters' carts, private carriages,
horses, mules, &#x0026;c., with plenty of sheep, poultry, and bread, they
are enjoying their freedom for the first time with a vengeance. It is
one of the quaintest and most laughable sights in the world to see the
big negroes lolling back in the carriages, driven along the road by
one of their own colour.</q></p>

<p>General M'Clellan had arrived at New York. He was serenaded at the

is proposed.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason Jones, the popular Irish orator, was lecturing in Irving
Hall, New York, on the subject of "John Philpot Curran," to a crowded
and fashionable audience, chiefly of Irish descent. Having occasion to
quote a speech of Curran's on Universal Emancipation, and Cowper's
lines, which commence "Slaves cannot breathe in England," a portion of
the audience rose in indignation and covered the orator with
insults. After an interregnum of disorder, which the orator's
partisans succeeded in terminating, he was allowed to conclude in
peace, on condition that he steered clear of the dangerous
subject.</p></div2>

<p>...Seven hundred thousand men, according to the Federal organs, are
now in arms against the Confederates. Making the deductions which we
have been taught to make from all American statistics, we may assume
that the North has nearly half a million of soldiers of all kinds. It
seems almost beyond belief that great results should not follow the
assemblage of such armaments, and yet the whole war has been a lesson
against expectations of such results. At the dispatch of the last
mails it was believed that the new Commander of the Potomac Army was
likely to engage the Confederates near Fredericksburg. There is no
other news, save that the Alabama continued to incense the minds of
the Northerners, and that the papers, by way of pleasing the populace,
were pandering to the evil feeling against England, and urging that

<p rend="center">GENERAL "STONEWALL" JACKSON.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi> give on the first page a Portrait of
the famous Confederate officer General Thomas Jefferson Jackson,
better known as "Stonewall" Jackson. He won this cognomen at Bull Run
by promising Beauregard that his brigade should stand like a stone
wall before the enemy, and well the promise was kept.</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson Jackson was born in Virginia, about the year
1825. He graduated at West Point in 1846, and in the following year
accompanied Magruder's battery to Mexico. At Contreras and Churubusco
he distinguished himself so highly on the field that he was breveted
Captain for gallantry. At Chapultepec he again won laurels, and was
breveted Major for gallant and meritorious conduct. On his return from
Mexico he was for some time in command at Fort Hamilton. At the
outbreak of the rebellion Major Jackson was one of those Southerners
who were greatly embarrassed to discover the true line of their
duty. He had married a Northern wife, was an honourable and
conscientious man, and long hesitated what course to pursue. It is
stated that his father-in-law, a Northern clergyman, visited him and
urged him to remain faithful to his country and his flag. They spent
several hours in prayer together, and Jackson confessed that the
struggle was sore. But, finally, the doctrine of State Rights, which
Jackson, like so many other gallant Southerners, had imbibed early in
life, won the day. "I must go  with Virginia!" he cried, and plunged
headlong into the vortex. The doings of this officer are too vividly
impressed upon the public mind to need a recapitulation, even if we
had space, which we have not, to particularise his thousand and one
deeds of daring, all of which, whatever the result, were strongly
marked by dash, energy, and skill.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Savannah News</hi>
published the following sketch of General Jackson:--<q>There you see
self-command, perseverance, indomitable will, that seem neither to
know nor think of any earthly obstacle, and all this without the least
admixture of vanity, assumption, pride, foolhardiness, or anything of
the kind. There seems a disposition to assert its pretensions, but
from the quiet sense of conviction of his relative position, which
sets the vexed question of self-importance at rest--a peculiarity, I
would remark, of great minds. It is only the little and the frivolous
who are for ever obtruding their petty vanities before the world. His
face also expresses courage in the highest degree, and his
phrenological developments indicate a vast amount of energy and
activity. His forehead is broad and prominent, the occipital and
sinciptal regions are both large and well-balanced; eyes expressing a
singular union of mildness, energy, and concentration; cheek and nose
both long and well-formed. His dress is a common grey suit of faded
cassimere--coat, pants, and hat--the coat slightly braided on the
sleeve, just enough to be perceptible, the collar displaying the mark
of a Major-General. Of his gait, it is sufficient to say that he just
goes along--not a particle of the strut, the military swagger,
turkey-gobbler parade, so common among officers of small rank and
smaller minds. It would be a profitable study for some of our military
swells to devote one hour each day to the contemplation of the
magnificent plainness of "Stonewall." To military fame which they can
never hope to attain he unites the simplicity of a child and the
straightforwardness of a Western farmer. There may be those who would
be less struck with his appearance as thus accoutred than if
bedizened with lace and holding the reins of a magnificent barb
caparisoned and harnessed for glorious war; but to one who had seen
him, as I had, at Cold Harbour and Malvern Hill, in the rain of shell
and the blaze of the death-lights of the battle-field, when nothing
less than a mountain would serve as a breastwork against the 36-inch
shells which howled and shrieked through the sickly air, General
Jackson in tatters would be the same hero as General Jackson in gilded
uniform. In my simple view he is a nonpareil--he is without peer. He
has enough energy to supply a whole manufacturing district, enough
military genius to stock two or three military schools of the size of
West Point.</q></p>

<p>The following sketch of the great Confederate General is given by
the New York correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>:--<q>The interest excited by this strange man
is as curious as it is unprecedented. A classmate of M'Clellan at West
Point, and there considered slow and heavy, unfavourably known in
Washington as a hypochondriac and <hi rend="italic">malade
imaginaire</hi>, he has exhibited for the last ten months qualities
which were little supposed to reside in his rugged and unsoldierlike
frame, but which will hand his name down for many a generation in the
company of those great captains whom men will not willingly let
die. More apt for the execution than conception of great movements,
leaning upon General Lee as the directing brain, and furnishing the
promptest hand, the most dauntless heart, the most ascetic and
rigorous self-denial, the greatest rapidity and versatility of
movement, as his contributions towards the execution of General Lee's
strategy, his recent operations in turning General Pope's right, and
passing with a force believed not to exceed 30,000 men to the rear of
such an army, massed close to its base of operations and in the act of
receiving daily large reinforcements, command universal wonder and
admiration. It is said that, like Hannibal, he is accustomed to live
among his men without distinction of dress, without greater delicacy
of fare, and that it is almost impossible, on this account, for a
stranger to recognise or distinguish him among
them. Every despatch from his hand has, as its exordium, "By the
blessing of God." Continual are the prayer-meetings which he holds
among his men, invoking a blessing upon his arms before the battle and
returning thanks for preservation, and (as it has rarely failed to
happen) for victory after it is over. In fact, they who have seen and
heard him uplift his voice in prayer, and then have witnessed his
vigour and prompt energy in the strife, say that once again Cromwell
is walking the earth and leading his trusting and enraptured hosts to
assured victory. It is not necessary to add that Jackson's men idolise
and trust their leader enthusiastically, and have the most implicit
faith in his conduct, otherwise the bold and daring steps which he has
frequently taken, and from which he has never failed to come off
triumphantly, would have been utter impossibilities.</q></p></div2>

the camp there recently came to light on article quite unexpected--a
human finger. It had belonged to a soldier, had been amputated after a
battle, was dried by the man, and then dispatched by post to a

being liable to letter postage, and was opened at Washington, and the
finger fell out, whether to be restored or sent to the Dead Letter

<p>The newly-formed Emancipation Society has issued an address, with
the object of evoking an unequivocal expression of English feeling in
favour of the Federal States of America. The principal object of this
society, as explained by its promoters, is to make it everywhere
perceived and confessed, by the force of indisputable testimony, that
the South is fighting for the preservation of slavery, while the North
is fully committed to the destruction of the inhuman system; and they
therefore urge that Englishmen should encourage the friends of
abolition in America by all the means in their power.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Etna we are in receipt of news to the 29th
ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Burnside has not yet proceeded to the bombardment of
Fredericksburg. His head-quarters are near Acquia Creek, on the
Potomac. President Lincoln had visited the latter at Belle Plaine and
made a personal investigation into the condition of the army. The
railroad is completed from Acquia Creek to the head-quarters of the
Federal army.</p>

<p>President Davis has ordered the Confederate General commanding the
Mississippi department to demand the surrender of the Federal General
M'Niel for murdering ten Confederate citizens of Missouri. If this is
refused, and the charges are proved to be true, the Confederate
General is instructed to execute the first ten Federal officers that
are captured.</p>

<p>The Confederates have erected extensive fortifications at Port
Hudson, on the Mississippi, 150 miles from New Orleans, commanding the
entrance to the river.</p>

<p>The negro regiment in South Carolina has again been under fire. A
correspondent thus describes their behaviour:--<q>Three companies left
Beaufort in two steamers, going to Doboy Sound, Georgia, and remaining
there a week, returning with 200,000 ft. of the best Georgia pine
lumber, sawed and ready for use. This was taken from Hawkins's, Todds',
and Blue's mills, on the mainland, directly in face of the rebels, who
gave the black soldiers an opportunity to test their pluck on shore,
as they had previously on a tug-boat, where they fought with the
advantage of a partial barricade. While most of the negroes were
engaged in loading the steamers with lumber, the company of Captain
Janes advanced on a reconnaissance, and were opened upon with musketry
by the rebels from a position in ambush. The negroes deliberately
returned the fire, and, drawn up in line of battle, kept up a
fusillade, maintaining their ground until, by the aid of the guns of
the steamers and those of their convoy, the gun-boat Madgie, the enemy
were dislodged. Three of the coloured soldiers were wounded, one so
seriously that his arm must be amputated. The officers of these men
express the greatest confidence in their fighting qualities.</q></p>

<p>The Federal Government has issued an order for the release of all
prisoners held in military charge for discouraging the enlistments and
opposing the draught. All persons arrested in the rebel States for
hostility to the Federal Government will be released on parole or
allowed to leave the country. This does not, however, refer to persons
who have been in arms against the Government.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has ordered the Attorney-General to take measures
for carrying out the Confiscation Act.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Georgia has voted 500,000 dols. for obstructions
to be placed in all the navigable streams of Georgia.</p>

<p>The Nassau <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> asserts that Admiral
Wilkes had threatened to enter Nassau without the permission of the
Governor, but that he afterwards bore away and lay at the distance of
a marine league from the shore. The same journal states that the
captain of the Federal steamer Octorora had infringed the Queen's
proclamation in capturing a schooner within the Abaco Reef.</p>

<p>Several officers of General Meagher's brigade having sent in their
resignations in consequence of the removal of General
M'Clellan, General Meagher has issued a highflown order disapproving
the conduct of these officers. The order contains the following
passage:--<q>Commending a brigade composed principally of Irish
soldiers, the Brigadier-General considers it not out of place to
remind them that the great error of the Irish people in their struggle
for an independent national existence has been their passionate and
blind adherence to an individual instead of a principle or cause. Thus
for generations their heroic efforts in the right direction have been
feverish and spasmodic, when they should have been continuous,
equable, and consistent. The placing on the public records the
resignations referred to would have renewed in the history of this
country, to the disparagement of our race, this fatal error, of a
nature which is at once so vehement and so weak, so faithful and yet
so wayward, so variable in great undertakings, and yet so persistent
in those lesser ones which merely concern a chief, a prince, or the
favourite political leader of the day.</q></p>

<p>The advance of General Grant in Mississippi has released about
200,000 bales of cotton. Some of the staple lies in the storehouses
unginned, just as the negroes left it after picking, while the larger
part of it is still on the plantations. The contrabands, who are still
thronging into General Grant's lines by hundreds, are to be set to
work to gather this valuable crop for the benefit of the Federal
Government.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The New York press of both the political parties criticise the
official correspondence on the subject of the proposed mediation in an
unfavourable tone towards France and England, while they find occasion
to laud the conduct of the Government of St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> asserts that it is
reported on high authority from Washington that the British Admiral
Milne is in pursuit of the Confederate Steamer Alabama.</p>

<p>The Boston newspaper proprietors have raised the price of their
journals 50 per cent, in consequence of the rise in the price of every
article that enters into the composition of a newspaper. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> predicts that the New York press
will have to do the same, as they are now giving to the public for two
cents what costs them four or five to produce.</p>

<p>Mr. Mason Jones has again delivered his oration on Curran before a
New York audience. On this occasion the native American element
preponderated in the composition of the audience. Curran's fine piece
of declamation concerning universal emancipation was received with
loud applause, unmingled with any signs of disapprobation.</p>

<p>Mrs. Edwin James has filed a complaint in the New York Courts for a
divorce from her husband on the charge of adultery.</p><pb n="623"/>

<p>General M'Clellan has refused a public reception in New York.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving Day was celebrated throughout the North on the 27th
ult. Contributions were received in the churches of the Atlantic
cities for the Lancashire operatives.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The Hibiscus Mosheutos</hi>, a North American
perennial plant of the order Malvace&#xE6;, has received the name of
American jute, from the nature of its fibre, although it belongs to a
different order. Specimens of this fibre in various stages of
manufacture have been recently laid before the Franklin Institute,
Philadelphia. This plant is indigenous to the Northern States, growing
in abundance in the swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey,
&#x0026;c. A patent has been taken out by Mr. W. J. Cantelo for its
application in the manufacture of paper, ropes, and various fabrics
hitherto made of cotton. Mr. Howson, who submitted the specimens to
the Institute, stated that papermakers had estimated the fibre to be
worth 100 dollars a ton as a substitute for rags, and ropemakers
declare rope made from it to be equal to that made from hemp and
superior to that made from Manilla jute. He enumerated, among other
advantages, that the plants required no care after the first year's
planting, that the ground they grow on is worthless for all
agricultural pursuits, that the machinery required to work it is of
the simplest character, &#x0026;c.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> tone of the American Federal papers upon England's refusal to
join in an attempt at mediation is as unfriendly as might have been
expected. Some writers say that we were afraid to interfere, others
that we rejoice in the war because it tends to weaken the Union. Nor
are the comments of such of the Southern papers as have reached us
much more civil, and there is an evidence of disappointment at our
declining to take a course which would have implied a recognition of
the Confederate States. For all this, and more, we were of course
prepared. It is most essential that Englishmen should keep their heads
quite cool in relation to American affairs, and should make no
demonstrations that may lead us into mistakes, to be retracted
hereafter. The real question is very simple, however much interested
partisans may seek to complicate it. We have no sympathy with those
who are seeking to crush a nation that desires to be isolated; we have
no sympathy with a nation that upholds the atrocious system of
slavery. But we admire the valour displayed on both sides, and we
lament the cruel and useless sacrifice of life. That is the English
standpoint, and we are neither to be menaced, cajoled, nor taunted
into abandoning it. We have now to deplore the appearance of a new and
hideous feature in the war. The recent military murders of citizens by
the Federal troops have produced a demand by the Confederate President
that the officer who perpetrated those crimes shall be delivered up to
him, and in default Mr. Davis has ordered the hanging of the next ten
Federal officers captured in Kentucky. Against such savageness all
nations should protest, and it is clearly for Mr. Lincoln's <sic corr="Government">Goverment</sic>
to set itself right with the world by a signal act of justice. We do
not hear much that is explicit as to the movements or intentions of
the armies, but a "secret" Federal expedition (of the object of which
the Confederates are no doubt well informed) was about to be launched,
possibly in aid of the movement on<pb n="627"/> Richmond. Over and
over again the inhabitants of Fredericksburg have been told that--
<q rend="center">Soon they should hear the firelock prattling,</q>
<q rend="center">Soon should the noisy cannon hum,</q>
<q rend="center">Soon should the shells in showers come rattling,</q>
<q rend="center">Sputtered on high by the jolly bomb.</q>
But up to the last advices the bombardment had not taken place, for
"sufficing reasons." A day of thanksgiving for what to the less subtle
minds in America do not seem very great gains, and the liberation of
political prisoners, complete the tale of Transatlantic
news.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">President Lincoln's
Message.</hi></p>
<p>By the arrival of the City of Washington we are in receipt of New
York journals to the 6th inst. They contain the President's Message
and the reports of the different Departments which were made to
Congress on Dec. 1, being the day of its reassembling. The President's
Message treats first of</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Foreign Affairs.</hi></p>
<p>With reference to these, he says:--<q><p>If the condition of our
relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually
been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a
nation so unhappily distracted as we are might reasonably have
apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds to
expect the maritime Powers which at the beginning of our domestic
difficulties so unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognised
the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that position,
which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own
country. But the temporary reverses which afterwards befel the
national arms, and which were exaggerated by her own disloyal citizens
abroad, have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice. The civil
war, which has so radically changed for the moment the occupations and
habits of the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social
conditions and affected very deeply the prosperity of the nations with
which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily increasing
throughout a period of half a century. It has at the same time excited
political ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound
agitation throughout the civilised world. In this unusual agitation we
have forborne from taking part in any controversy between foreign
States, and between parties or factions in such States. We have
attempted no propagandism and acknowledged no revolution; but we have
left to every nation the exclusive conduct and management of its own
affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by foreign
nations with reference less to its own merits than to its supposed and
often exaggerated effects, and the consequence resulting to those
relations themselves. Nevertheless, complaint on the part of this
Government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Treaty With Great
Britain.</hi></p>
<p>The Treaty with Great Britain for the suppression
of the African slave trade has been put into operation with a good
prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to
acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of her Majesty's
Government has been marked with a jealous respect for the authority of
the United States, and the rights of their moral and loyal
citizens.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Blockade And
Foreign Nations.</hi></p>
<p>A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be
established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial
activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and
inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their
subjects. A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside
and carry on a trade under treaty stipulations is necessarily fruitful
of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such collisions
tend to excite misapprehensions and possibly to produce mutual
reclamations between nations which have a common interest in
preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds I have,
so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been
presented by friendly Powers. There is, however, a large and
augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the Government is unable to
agree with the Governments whose protection is demanded by the
claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States
or their citizens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities
of foreign nations which the Governments of these States are not at
once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign States
thus interested mutual conventions to examine and adjust such
complaints. This proposition has been made especially to Great
Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been
kindly received, but has not yet been formally adopted.</p></q></p>

<p>The President then refers to his favourite project for the
voluntary emigration of the free negroes, and alludes to the
negotiation of commercial treaties with Liberia, Hayti, and
Turkey.</p>
<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Relations With Europe
And Asia.</hi></p>
<p>Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia,
Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, and Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome,
and the other European States remain undisturbed. Very favourable
relations also continue to to maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China,
and Japan.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Relations With Minor American
States.</hi></p>
<p>During the last year there has not only been no change of our
previous relations with the independent States of our own continent,
but more friendly sentiments than have heretofore existed are believed
to be entertained by those neighbours whose safety and progress are so intimately connected with
our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, Honduras, Peru, and Chili.</p></q>

<p>The President favours the project of the Atlantic telegraph cable,

<p>The President recommends Secretary Chase's plan of driving out of
circulation the existing banknote currency (estimated by the Secretary
at 167,000,000 dols.) by a tax which should force the banks to
reorganise under a general Act of Congress, and receive in exchange
for their present corporation notes United States' notes based on a
deposit by these institutions of United States' bonds.</p>
<p>After deducting the sums paid in redemption of the public debt, he
reports that the actual expenditure for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1862, was, in round numbers, 475,000,000 dols., and the receipts
488,000,000 dols., leaving a surplus in the treasury of 13,000,000
dols. Of the receipts, 434,000,000 dols. were obtained by loans,
49,000,000 dols. for customs, and less than 2,000,000 dols. from the
property and income tax. The small balance of receipts is made up of a
balance from 1861 and the incomings of minor taxes.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Post Office.</hi></p>
<p>The President reports that the secession of the Southern States has
greatly benefited this department by lessening its expenditures
without decreasing its receipts. By virtue of these facts the annual
deficit of this department has fallen from 4,500,000 dols. to
2,100,000 dol.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Public Lands.</hi></p>
<p>The sale of public lands has ceased to be a source of revenue since
the passage of the Free Homestead Act, which will come into operation
on the 1st of January next.</p>
<p>The President alludes to the Indian troubles in the north-west,
favours the completion of the Great Pacific Railroad, and the
enlargement, for military and commercial reasons, of the New York and
Illinois Canals. He asserts that the newly-created Department of
Agriculture is very active. The President devotes the concluding
portion of his Message to the subject of disunion and emancipation. He
reiterates his arguments against disunion. He says of the people of
the north-west, "True to themselves, they will not ask where a line of
separation shall be, but will vow rather that there shall be no such
line."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Compensated
Emancipation.</hi></p>
<p>The President then proposes to Congress to adopt the following
amendments to the United States' Constitution:--</p>
<q><p>Every State wherein slavery now exists which shall abolish the
same therein at any time or times before the 1st day of January, in
the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred, shall receive
compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:--</p>
<p>"The President of the United States shall deliver to every such
State bonds of the United States, bearing interest at the rate of ---
for each slave shown to have been therein by the eighth census of the
United States, said bonds to be delivered to such State by
instalments, or in one parcel, at the completion of the abolishment,
accordingly as the same shall have been gradual, or at one time,
within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond
only from the proper time of its delivery as aforesaid, and afterwards
any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and subsequently
introducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United
States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest
paid thereon.</p>
<p>All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of
the war at any time before the end of the rebellion shall be for ever
free; but all owners of such who shall not have been disloyal shall be
compensated for them at the same rates as are provided for States
adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such a way that no slave shall
be twice accounted for.</p><pb n="647"/>
<p>Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonising
free coloured persons, with their own consent, at any place or places
without the United States.</p>
<milestone unit="section" rend="stars"/>
<p>The plan, consisting of these articles, is recommended, not but
that a restoration of the national authority would be accepted without
its adoption, nor will the war or proceedings under the proclamation
of Sept. 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this
plan. Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and
thereby stay both. This plan is recommended as a means, not in
conclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and
preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is
presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am
confident, secure peace more speedily than can be done by force alone,
while it would cost less, considering amounts and manner of payment and times
of payment, and the amounts would be easier paid, than will be the
additional cost of the war if we rely solely upon force.</p></q>
<p>The peroration of the Message is the following somewhat inartistic
piece of rhetoric:--</p>
<q><p>Fellow citizens,--We cannot escape history. We, of this Congress, will
be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or
insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through
which we pass will light us down in honour or dishonour to the latest
generation. We say that we are for the Union. The world will not
forget that while we say this we do know how to save the Union. The
world knows we do know how to save it. We, even we here, hold the
power and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave we
assure freedom to the free, honourable alike in what we give and what
we preserve. We shall nobly save or meanly lose the last best hope of
the earth. Other means may succeed. This could not fail. The way is
plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which, if followed, the world
will for ever applaud and God most for ever bless.</p></q>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Report Of The Secretary Of
The Treasury.</hi></p>

<p>The Secretary begins by acknowledging that his estimates of the
expenses during the past fiscal year fell short of the reality. He
estimates that the public debt of the United States will amount on the
1st of July next to 1,222 000,000 dols. The average rate of interest
on the whole loan is 4.35 per cent: that part of it which consists of 
the United States' small notes being practically a loan from the 
people to their Government without interest. The expenses for the 
current fiscal year are set down at 788,500,000 dols. Of this sum
180,500,000 dols. will be raised by taxation, and the rest by loans or
emission of paper-money. Of the former amount Mr. Chase expects
68,000,000 dols. from the tariff, and 85,500,000 dols. from the direct
tax. The postage-stamp currency issued amounts to 3,885,000 dols. It
cannot be supplied fast enough for the public needs. The Secretary
"does not yield to the phantasy that taxation is a blessing, and debt
a benefit:" but argues that the placing of the banks of the country
under the control of a central authority, with a uniform currency and
stock basis, will consolidate the United States and weaken the motives
for secession.</p>
<q><p>The proposed plan is recommended, finally, by the firm anchorage
it will supply to the union of the States. Every banking association
whose bonds are deposited in the treasury of the Union, every
individual who holds a dollar of the circulation secured by such
deposit, every merchant, every manufacturer, every farmer, every
mechanic interested in transactions dependent for success on the
credit of that circulation, will feel as an injury every attempt to
rend the national unity, with the permanence and stability of which
all their interests are so closely and vitally connected. Had the
system been possible, and had it actually existed two years ago, can
it be doubted that the national interests and sentiments enlisted by
it for the Union would have so strengthened the motives for adhesion
derived from other sources that the wild treason of secession would
have been impossible.</p></q>

<p>The Secretary finds room to say a word in favour of a uniform
international decimal currency:--</p>
<q><p>In the last report the Secretary took occasion to invite the
attention of Congress to the importance of uniform weights, measures,
and coins; and to the worth of the decimal system in the commerce of
the world. He now ventures to suggest that the present demonetisation
of gold may well he availed of for the purpose of taking one
considerable step towards these great ends. If the half-eagle of the
Union be made of equal weight and fineness with the gold sovereign of
Great Britain, no sensible injury could possibly arise from the
change, while, on the resumption of specie payments, its great
advantages would be felt in the equalisation of exchanges and the
convenience of commerce. This Act of the United States, moreover,
might be followed by the adoption by Great Britain of the Federal
decimal divisions of the coin, and thus a most important advance might
be secured towards an international coinage, with values decimally
expressed.</p></q>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Report of the Secretary of
the Navy.</hi></p>

<p>Secretary Welles begins by referring to the success of the
blockade in the following spirited terms:--</p>
<q><p>Since the commencement of our national difficulties four powerful squadrons have
been collected, organised, and stationed for duty on our maritime
frontiers with a rapidity and suddenness which find no approach to a
parallel in previous naval history, and which it is believed no
other country but our own could have achieved. These squadrons have
been incessantly maintaining a strict blockade of such gigantic
proportions that eminent foreign statesmen in the highest scenes of
legislation did not hesitate to denounce it as a "material
impossibility;" and yet, after this most imposing naval undertaking
had been for a period of eighteen months in operation, and after its
reach had been effectively extended along the entire sweep of our
Atlantic and Gulf coasts, from the outlet of the Chesapeake to the
mouth of the Rio Grande, the same eminent authorities, with a list in
their hands of all the vessels which had evaded or escaped the
vigilance of our blockading forces, could not refuse in their official
statements to admit with reluctant candour that the proof of the
efficiency of the blockade was conspicuous and wholly conclusive, and
that in no previous war had the ports of an enemy's country been so
effectually closed by a naval force. But even such testimony was not
needed. The proof of the fact abounds in the current price of our
Southern staples in the great commercial marts of the world, and 
more especially in the whole industrial and commercial condition of
the insurgent region. It should not be forgotten that no circumstance is wanting to attest the magnitude of the greatest of
all naval triumphs. The industrial necessities and the commercial
cupidity of all the principal maritime nations, armed and empowered as
they are by the resources of modern invention, are kept at bay. A
multitude of island harbours under foreign jurisdiction, looking
nearly upon our shores, and affording the most convenient
lurking-places from which illicit commerce may leap forth to its
prohibited destination and purpose, are so closely watched as to
render the peril of all such ventures far greater than even their
enormous gains when successful. And, finally, a vast line of
sea-coast, nearly three thousand miles in extent, much of it with a
double shore, and almost honeycombed with inlets and harbours, has
been so beleaguered and locked up, that the whole immense foreign
commerce, which was the very life of the industry and opulence of the
vast region which it borders, has practically ceased to exist.</p></q>

<p>The Secretary suggests that, when every part of the coast is in
Federal hands, the costly apparatus of an international blockade may
be dispensed with, and maritime intercourse be regulated by municipal
law. A detailed review of the doings of the navy during the preceding
year is followed by a passage reflecting on the British character of
the Alabama and the conduct of the British Government in letting her
get to sea, which has already been quoted by the daily journals. The
result of the extraordinary activity in this department is that the
United States have now afloat or progressing to rapid completion a
naval force consisting of 427 vessels, carrying 3268 guns, and of the
capacity of 340,000 tons. "The annals of the world do not show os
great an increase in so brief a period to the naval power of any
country." The iron-clad navy for the seaboard consists of 8 armed
wooden vessels and 20 armed iron vessels, carrying 98 guns; for the
western rivers, of 14 armoured wooden vessels and 12 armoured iron
vessels. The United States navy consists of 104 sailing-vessels,
carrying 1415 guns; and 323 steam-vessels, carrying 1853
guns. Mr. Welles thinks the British Warrior could get within only a
few harbours of the United States, and for those few "the Government
can always be prepared whenever a foreign war is imminent." That more
ironclads are not now ready is attributed to the scanty manufacturing
capacities of the United States. "It is believed that nearly every
rolling-mill has been engaged that is able to do the work, and yet
those vessels are several months behind the time within which they
were to be completed. . . . It is with the greatest difficulty that
these comparatively small vessels and the moderate-sized iron required
can be procured for them as soon as wanted, so much does the demand
exceed the capabilities of the mills to supply." Since the blockade
was instituted 543 vessels have been seized by the blockading
squadron, including a number of valuable steamers.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Report Of The Secretary Of War.</hi></p>
<p>Secretary Stanton reports that the armies of the United States
constitute a force of over 800,000 men fully armed and equipped. When
the quotas are filled up it will number 1,000,000 men, and the
estimates for next year are based upon that number. The issues of the
ordnance department are stated to have been 1926 field and siege and
1206 fortification cannon, 7294 gun-carriages, caissons, mortar-beds,
travelling forges and battery-waggons. 1,276,686 smallarms, 987,291
sets of equipments and accoutrements, and 2l3,991,127 rounds of
ammunition for artillery and smallarms, still leaving large supplies
of ordnance stores at the arsenals and d&#xE9;p&#xF4;ts. He acknowledges the
benefit the army has derived from negro labour in Louisiana and South
Carolina, and on the James and Potomac Rivers. The demand for their
labour has exceeded the supply available.</p>
<q><p>The greater part of the whole country, which formerly produced
the sea-island cotton, is now thoroughly restored to the Union. The
labourers are there--the soil and climate. It needs only assurance of
protection to revive the cultivation of the staple as well as to
produce vast quantities of corn and forage for our troops. Since this
war must be conducted by marches and battles and sieges, why neglect
the best means to make them successful, and their results permanent?
It is worthy of notice that thus far the portions of territory which,
once recovered, we have most firmly held, are precisely those in which
the greatest proportion of coloured men are found. By their assistance
our armies will be able permanently to operate in and occupy the
country; and in labour for the army, in raising its and their own
supplies, full occupation can be given them, and with this there will
be neither occasion nor temptation to emigrate to a northern and less
congenial climate.</p></q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Report Of The
General-In-Chief.</hi></p>
<p>General Halleck's report reveals the circumstances which led to the
dismissal of General M'Clellan. General M'Clellan, when at Harrison's
Landing, demanded a reinforcement of 50,000 men before marching on
Richmond. General Halleck could only promise 20,000. Under these
circumstances General Halleck gave orders that the Army of the Potomac
should evacuate the Peninsula on the 3rd of August and coalesce with
General Pope at Acquia Creek. General M'Clellan protested against this
order, and did not obey it until after the lapse of eleven days. This
delay caused the reverses of General Pope. "Had the army of the
Potomac arrived a few days earlier the rebel army could have been
easily defeated and perhaps destroyed." The long inactivity of General
M'Clellan after the battle of Antietam is strongly condemned. General
Halleck represents that victories have been won by the troops, while
the fruits thereof have been lost by the immobility of the commanding
General. The superior celerity of the Confederate armies is admitted
and commended. The army is warned that it carries by far too much
baggage, and insists upon too many luxuries, to allow it to be
speedily moved. The practice of absenteeism, fearfully prevalent among
officers and men, is reprobated, and more stringent military laws for
the suppression of this offence are recommended.</p></div2>

SATURDAY, DECEMBER</hi> 20, 1862.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">"Persicos Odi Apparatus"</hi> was probably the
declaration of many an anxious person who was waiting for the Persia's
news, and who anticipated the information that her machinery had got
out of order. But she has arrived at last, and brought President
Lincoln's Message. It is in many respects a remarkable document. If
ever debility was manifested in diplomacy, the manifestation has been
made in the document now before us. Passing over such of its details
as have no interest for the English reader, and remarking that the
President acknowledges that in<pb n="651"/> the delicate matter of the
slave trade England continues to act in the most satisfactory manner,
and leaving Mr. Lincoln's geographical essay on the impossibility of
dividing the United States to the consideration of those whom it may
concern, we proceed to note the President's new plan for dealing with
the question of slavery. He proposes that by legal and constitutional
enactment, not by his own <hi rend="italic">fiat libertas</hi>, all
slaves who shall not have been freed by a certain date shall be
enfranchised at the expense of the Union. The certain date will
probably make readers smile. It is New Year's Day, 1900. For
thirty-seven years to come the system which Mr. Lincoln's own party
have been branding as the "covenant with hell," and as "the accursed
black canker which is eating out the vitals of the Union," is to be
endured, unless accident does it away. This is the final prescription
of those who pretend to be fighting an anti-slavery war. As only one
or two of Mr. Lincoln's organs affect to treat this strange
proposition seriously, we may abstain from remark upon it until the
verdict of the North shall be taken. But as Mr. Lincoln has one
faculty, that of telling a good story when an argument is expected, we
may respectfully offer him an Oriental tale. A King had a favourite
white donkey, to which he became so attached that he sent for the
wisest of his physicians and ordered him, under pain of death, to make
the animal speak. The wise physician instantly assented, but demanded
two conditions--a large reward at once, and a term of seven years to
perform the miracle. The terms were accepted, and to wondering friends
the wise physician said, "I have surely done a good thing. I have got
a heap of money and have preserved my life. In seven years the King,
the ass, or I may die, and either event makes me safe." Let us add
that in one point of view the President's practical retraction of his
previous scheme is satisfactory. The elections have told, and the
power of public opinion has asserted itself. This is the healthiest
sign we have had to chronicle for some time. There are brief accounts
of engagements, in which success seems to have been divided--Morgan
having had a triumph, and having afterwards been repulsed, and some
Confederate "raids" appear to have been fortunate. Fredericksburg had
not been bombarded. General Bank's naval expedition had sailed; his
friends did not know his destination, but his enemies were, doubtless,
better informed. The Secretary of the Navy is very bitter against
England about the Alabama, but it is very difficult to see that we are
in fault because she terrifies New York. It is more pleasant to add
that the American merchants are raising a subscription in aid of the
Englishmen who suffer by the American War.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">DEMOCRATIC PROCESSION IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">OUR</hi> Engraving represents a procession of
the Democratic party, with flags, transparencies, and bands of music,
passing the New York Hotel en route for an evening open-air meeting in
the City Hall Park, to ratify the nomination of the Hon. Horatio
Seymour as Governor of the State of New York, and of Messrs. Elijah
Ward, Fernando Wood, Benjamin Wood, and James Brooks as members of
Congress for four of the electoral districts of the city. The New York
Hotel, in Broadway, is well know[n] to travellers as, without exception,
the best-conducted establishment of its kind in America; and equally
well known to the residents of New York for its excellent cuisine, its
unrivalled wine-cellar, and its political sympathies. Without being a
club, in the English sense of the word, it is practically the Carlton
and Conservative club of the city; the head-quarters and rendezvous of
all the prominent politicians, generals, functionaries, and wealthy
citizens who desire the supremacy of the law, and whose battle-cry in
the present deplorable struggle is "The Constitution as it is, and the
Union as it was." When the procession passed this well-known hostelry
the order was given to halt, the band struck up "Dixie" and the
"Star-spangled Banner;" three cheers were given for Horatio Seymour,
and responded to by the guests who had gathered at the door and on the
balcony. It then went on its way, rejoicing, to the place of meeting,
already certain of the victory which its party was destined to achieve
within a short interval, a victory which has already changed the
current of Federal politics, and which clearly foreshadows that the
Republican party has no chance of electing another President in
succession to Mr. Lincoln.</p></div2>

to the rear of the first. As the Federals were crossing the river the

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Correspondence Of The Department Of State.</hi></p>
<p>A volume of about three hundred pages has been communicated to
Congress containing the correspondence of the Department of State with
the foreign Ministers during the past year.</p>
<p>The following is an abstract of the despatches addressed by
Mr. Adams to Mr. Seward:--</p>
<q><p>In June last Mr. Adams writes that the darling desire of the
governing classes of England that America may be divided, though
subdued in expression by events, remains as strong as ever. Mr. Adams
writes, in October, that he has had an interview with Earl Russell, in
which, referring to Mr. Gladstone's speech, Earl Russell said, with
some degree of embarrassment, that it was not for him to disavow
anything on the part of Mr. Gladstone, but that Mr. Gladstone had no
idea in saying what he did that there was serious intention to infer a
disposition of the Government to adopt a new policy. Earl Russell
stated as guardedly as possible that Lord Palmerston and the other
members of the Cabinet regretted Mr. Gladstone's speech, and it was
still their intention to let the struggle come to its natural end
without the smallest interference on their part.</p></q>
<p> Mr. Seward's recent communications to Mr. Adams are summarised
thus:--</p>
<q><p>In June Mr. Seward writes that a list of purchases made for the
Confederates in England, which list had fallen into the hands of the
Federals, shows that the complaints made to Earl Russell fall short of
the real abuses of neutrality committed in England in the very face of
the British Government. The revolution is now approaching its end, and
it is just at this moment proof becomes irresistible that if it had
succeeded its success would have been due to the assistance derived
from the English people. The President thinks it desirable the English
Government should consider before the war closes what are likely to be
the sentiments of England and America towards each other after its
termination. In August Mr. Seward writes that a war with England could
not fail to unite North and South. In November he writes that while
European political parties are more hostile than ever to America,
America herself is stronger to resist intervention than at any former
period. Less than three years ago all England showed itself desirous
of friendship with America, and a similar desire may before long
recur. On the 3rd of the same month Mr. Seward states that the
President is compelled to regard the destruction of ships by the
Alabama as having been made by British subjects in violation of the
law of nations. Legal proofs to support indemnity claims will be
collected and transmitted as soon as possible.</p></q>

<p>Mr. Seward writes to Mr. Dayton, the United States' Minister at
Paris, that America has a right to insist that France shall not make
use of the war she is carrying on in Mexico to raise up an
anti-American or anti-Republican Government, or maintain such
Government in power. France having disclaimed such designs, America is
bound to wait, and not anticipate their execution.</p>
<p>The despatches from Russia represent Prince Gortschakoff as
desiring to see a termination of the war, as hopeless of the
restoration of the Union, and yet regarding its disruption as a
serious calamity for Russia. Mr. Cameron and Mr. Bayard Taylor, the
Secretary of the Legation, represent the manner of the Czar and the
Prince towards them as being cordial in the extreme.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Congress.</hi></p>
<p>Both Houses of Congress have passed the bill admitting Western
Virginia as a State of the Union, and providing for the gradual but
speedy emancipation of her slaves. The Governor of this region
approves of Mr. Lincoln's proclamation of the 22nd of September.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has refused to pass a vote of censure 
on the aforesaid proclamation of emancipation by a vote of 95 to
47.</p>
<p>Both Houses have passed a bill indemnifying President Lincoln for
all arrests made and maintained in violation of the right to the writ
of habeas corpus. In the House of Representatives, where the
opposition was strongest, the bill passed by the vote of 90 to 45,
which exhibits the relative strength of the Administration and
Opposition parties in the present Congress.</p>

the most important speech, in which he urged British and American
philanthropy to meet half way and build up a new temple of
reconciliation in which Americans and Britons could join hands once
more and swear to be true to each other and to all principles of civil
and religious liberty. The subscriptions in behalf of the Lancashire
operatives are made chiefly in grain, but include more than 100,000
dollars in cash.</p>
<p>A "cold snap" having visited the Atlantic coast, the people of the
Atlantic cities, the young, the middle-aged, and the ladies were
enjoying the amusement of skating with as much abandon as before the
commencement of the war.</p></div2>

<p>...America continues to be the one theme that occupies the world's
tongue and thought. The Rappahannock has been crossed in the face of
the whole Confederate army; and by the time these pages reach the
reader a battle will probably have been fought upon which great issues
may hang. If the Confederates are the winners it will go far to
establish, as an unquestionable fact, their military superiority, and
to inspirit them, in spite of all difficulties, to new exertions and
struggles. But if they are beaten their position will be a most
dangerous one. General Sumner has also, and on an earlier day, crossed
the river some miles further down, and from that point was almost
within a day's march of Petersburg and its railway, which is connected
with all the railways of North and South Carolina, and must be the
chief line for bringing supplies to Lee's army. Sumner, therefore, in
the event of a Federal victory at Fredericksburg, would be ready to
make a flank attack on the retreating army; and that most dangerous
measure under the circumstances could only be evaded by the
Confederates retreating by a different and circuitous line to
Richmond, so that the Federals would probably be able to reach the
Confederate capital first. Much, then, depends upon the battle at
Fredericksburg, which we are told by telegrams arriving at the moment
we write had actually begun.</p>

<p>The Alabama threatens to become a source of trouble between our own
and the American Governments. If the responsible advisers of the Crown
say the English law of enlistment has been violated by the building
and fitting out of such a vessel in our country, it will be of course
our duty to offer amends. But if no law has been violated the
Americans must learn to be less susceptible, to annoyance, and direct
their energies rather to the capture of the offending vessel than to
angry abuse of us. Meantime we cannot but own the Americans are doing
a very handsome act in contributing so largely to the wants of our
operatives.</p></div2>

<p>...There is a paper panic in New York. Rags, so it seems, are no
longer obtainable, or have been all used up by Mr. Chase for the
manufacture of shin-plasters. The Associated Press invite tenders for
the supply of three million pounds of paper, to be paid for--in
paper--on delivery; but there are no bidders. Meanwhile, with ruin
staring them in the face, according to the veracious "Manhattan," all
the New York papers have increased their prices fifty per cent, and
the astute Mr. James Gordon Bennett, of the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, wishing to preserve intact the fortune he

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">An Irish Recruiting-Office In
Broadway.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Federal Government, as must by this
time be well known all over Europe, could not have carried on the war
against the South on anything like equal terms if it had not been for
the aid afforded by the Irish and German population. American citizens
of native birth volunteered in large numbers immediately after the
attack on Fort Sumter, which expedited the collision; but their zeal
did not keep pace with the exigences of the work they had undertaken;
and, in urgent need of men, the Government was compelled to have
recourse to the system of high bounty-money to foreigners and to
naturalized foreigners to fill up the depleted ranks of an army that
melted away in swamps and hospitals more rapidly then in the
battle-field. The Government offered 100 dollars bounty-money to each
recruit, and, this sum not being sufficient to provide the first batch
of 300,000 men that Mr. Lincoln demanded during the summer, and the
second 300,000 that he demanded under the penalty of a conscription if
the men were not otherwise forthcoming, the corporations of the
various cities in the north, aided by the liberality of wealthy and
patriotic citizens, doubled and trebled the offer of the Government,
and in some places actually raised the bounties to 500 and 600
dollars. The results were a large enrolment of Irishmen and Germans,
to whom the bounty-money was the attraction rather than love of the
cause, and many of whom had been rebels in their own country before
they took up arms to fight rebellion in the land of their
adoption. The most favourite of the regiments thus raised among the
foreign recruits were the Zouaves, in imitation of those of Paris, and
composed of a similar class of people, to whom the brilliant and
picturesque costume was almost as much an inducement to enlist as the
ready money. Our Engraving represents a group of these foreigners
before a well-known recruiting-office at Mozart Hall, Broadway. The
draught or conscription has been postponed sine die in New York for
fear lest there should be a popular outbreak if unwilling men were
forcibly carried off to a war which it might ruin their business to
attend, or of which for other reasons they might not approve; but
there has been no cessation of recruiting, which is still carried on with
the utmost possible vigour. New York city and State are said to have
provided nearly 80,000 men under Mr. Lincoln's two calls; but as the
quota due, according to the population, is about 110,000, there is
still a very large number of men to be provided.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Fort Lafayette.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> traveller to America who enters the beautiful harbour of New
York by any of the ocean steamers will observe, on the right hand in
passing the channel known as "The Narrows," a solitary fort on an
island at some distance from the shore. This is Fort Lafayette, so
named in honour of the French General who immortalised his name by the
aid he rendered to the Americans on their early struggle for
independence. It is a pity that such a name should have been
desecrated in later days by the perversion of the fort from its
original purpose of guardian of the channel to a bastille for the
detention of political prisoners, sent thither on the sole warrant of
<hi rend="italic">lettres de cachet</hi>, on bare suspicion, or on the
secret testimony of spies and informers. Lafayette himself, had he
lived<pb n="696"/> long enough to witness the wreck which the Federal
Americans have been making of their own liberties in the futile
attempt to subjugate the South, might perhaps have urged the
Government of Mr. Lincoln to adopt another and wiser course of policy;
or, if that were not to be thought of, to give some other name than
him to a fortress that had been converted into an instrument of
tyranny as flagrant as the old Bastille so famous in the history of
the the first French Revolution. For the last fifteen months Fort
Lafayette (like its sister forts in the harbours of Boston and
Baltimore) has been filled with political prisoners, mostly consigned
thither by order of Mr. Seward, the Secretary of State, or of
Mr. Simon Cameron, the former, and Mr. Stanton, the present, Secretary
of the War Department, Then arrests had become so numerous, and the
outrage to the Constitution both of the State of New York and of the
Federal Union involved in the virtual abrogation of the right secured
to the humblest citizens by the writ of habeas corpus, was so
flagitious, that the Democratic party, defeated at the election of
Mr. Lincoln, reorganised its broken phalanx to resist the encroachment
of arbitrary power. At the elections which took place on the 4th
ult. the Democrats succeeded in carrying their candidate, the
Hon. Horatio Seymour, for Governor of the State, and the whole of
their members of Congress for the city, of New York. Other elections
throughout the North showed the same results. A powerful opposition
was thus formed, which, though appearing to side with the Government
in its determination to prosecute the war against the South with
unflinching zeal and untiring energy, was resolved at the same time
that the war should be carried on within the limits of the
Constitution, without the suspension of the habeas corpus in loyal
States, and without abrogation of any portion, great or small, of the
letter or the spirit of the document drawn up by the founders of
national independence and sanctified by the great names of Washington,
Jefferson, and other fathers of American liberty. The Government
appears to have been alarmed for the first time since the commencement
of the war at the stand taken by the Democratic party, which not only
threatened the punishment of the three Secretaries of State but the
impeachment of the President himself, for these and other illegal
acts. Having once begun to debate the question, the Government lost no
time in coming to a decision. On the 27th of November, little more
than three weeks after the triumphs of the Democrats in New York, it
took the opportunity of "Thanksgiving," which is annually celebrated
throughout the North on that day, and which answers in some respects
to the English festival of Christmas, to order the liberation of all
political prisoners in Forts Lafayette, Warren, MacHenry, and
Delaware. On that morning the gloomy gates were opened and the
prisoners were set free without stipulation or condition. Fort
Lafayette at present contains only its customary garrison for the
defence of the channel, and it is to be hoped will never again be
employed for any less legitimate purpose. Our Engraving is taken from
the water, near Staten Island. The fort is not of great value as a
means of defence, having been almost superseded in utility by Fort
Hamilton, the larger fort immediately behind it, on Long Island, which
has been recently erected, and which, in connection with Fort
Tompkins, now in process of construction on the point of Staten
Island, will effectually command the approaches to New
York.</p></div2>
