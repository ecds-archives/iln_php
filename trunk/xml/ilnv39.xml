<p>
The United States' mail-steamer Fulton has arrived at Southampton,
bringing New York journals to the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The blockade is now effective at all the principal ports of the
Southern coast.  The first Confederate privateer Savannah, whose
arrival at New York in charge of a prize crew we reported in our last,
was captured by the man-of-war Perry off the coast of South Carolina.
Her crew, numbering sixteen, are in irons on board the Minnesota, now
blockading Charleston.  The <title>New York Tribune</title> urges that these men be
hanged.  The Savannah was the first ship which applied for letters of
marque.  She had just captured and sent to Georgetown a Maine brig
before she encountered the Perry.  There have been several more
captures on the Potomac of Virginia coasting-vessels which were
engaged in supplying the Confederates with provisions.</p>

<p>There has been no movement of importance in the neighbourhood of
Fortress Monroe.  An Ohio regiment which went reconnoitring in a
railway train was fired upon at Vienna, fifteen miles west of
Alexandria, by a masked battery, and retired with a loss of twenty
men.  They were reinforced and returned, and found that the enemy had
disappeared.  This affair, in conjunction with the former check at
Great Bethel, has caused a great outcry against "militia officers,"
and a reaction of public opinion in favour of professional
commanders.</p>

<p>In the direction of Fairfax the Federals have pushed forward from
Alexandria four miles.  The enemy's pickets fell back on Fairfax.</p>

<p>The Confederate troops, under the command of General Johnson, who
lately evacuated Harper's Ferry, and were supposed to have retired
towards Richmond, suddenly reappeared on the Potomac at Piedmont,
considerably to the west of Harper's Ferry.  They forced the bridge
over the Potomac, which was guarded by forty loyal Marylanders, who
were all cut to pieces except two, and then advanced to Cumberland, in
Western Maryland, where they surrounded an Indiana regiment stationed
there.  Two Pennsylvania regiments have been sent forward from
Harrisburg to relieve this regiment, if possible.  If they have
capitulated this will be by far the greatest success of the
Confederate forces since the opening of the war.</p>

<p>The State of Missouri, which is loyal to the Union, has been the seat
of a series of scattered fights.  The parties to it are not the armies
of the Confederate and the United States, but the State militia of
Missouri and Federal volunteers of the same state, Illinois, and Iowa.
The Iowa troops have invaded this populous and flourishing State in
the west, and the Illinoisans have done so in the east.  General Lyon
is the Federal commander.  He has utterly routed the State troops at
Bonneville, a town a few miles north-west of the capital, and taken
their camp.  The loss of the vanquished was at first set down at three
hundred, but this is an exaggeration.  The Governor of the State fled
from the field in a southerly direction.  A few days afterwards a body
of the militia attacked the Union Home Guard of the town of Cole, and
drove them from the place with great loss.  There have been several
minor collisions in this afflicted State.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The New York journals continue to receive telegrams from the South
by way of Louisville, the chief city of the neutral State of Kentucky,
at which place Southern journals are still received.  A company has
recently been started in the same city to maintain postal
communication between the people of the two Confederations.  It offers
to deliver a letter of ordinary weight for 23 cents (11 1/2 d.).  The
previous rate was 3 cents.</p>

<p>By way of Louisville we learn that the South feels pinched for the
want of salt, printing-paper, lead, and leather.  The Southerners and
their slaves are in great want of new shoes.</p>

<p>In his reply to the Commissioners of the Maryland Legislature,
Mr. Davis reiterates his desire for peace, and declares that conquest
is inconsistent with that idea of State sovereignty which is the
fundamental principle of the Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p>The vote on secession in Tennessee is—for separation, 99,269;
against it, 14,206.  East Tennessee gave a majority of 13,177 against
seceding.  A Convention of East Tennesseans has been called to meet at
Knoxville, to deliberate on the advisability of resisting the
authority of the Confederate Government.</p>

<p rend="center">MARYLAND AND WEST VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Maryland have passed resolutions to the effect
that the war debt now being contracted by the Federal Government is
unconstitutionally incurred, and that Maryland will not hold herself
bound for any portion thereof.</p>

<p>The Wheeling Convention have signed a declaration of independence,
and elected Mr. Pierpoint Governor of the State, the theory being that
the regularly-elected State officials have forfeited their offices by
their treason to the Federal Government.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Journals belonging to the President's party state that Mr. Lincoln,
in his forthcoming Message to Congress, will recommend the levy of
half a million of men, and the creation of a debt of 250,000,000
dols., of debt for the speedy putting down of the rebellion.</p>

<p>The Government offers to pay for all damages done to private
property by the occupation of land or buildings in Virginia, or by any
willful mischief on the part of the Federal troops.</p>

<p>The Prize Court sitting in Washington has condemned an English
schooner and her cargo, valued at 22,000 dollars, for endeavouring to
run the blockade of the Virginia waters, subject, however, to further
advisement as to an alleged relaxation of the strict law in favour of
British ships then in port.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Russell, the <title>Times'</title> "special," has arrived at Cairo, Illinois.
He complains that many of his letters never reached their destination,
and that others were tampered with and altered.</p>

<p>The slaver Nightingale arrived at New York on the 18th ult. in
charge of a prize crew, having been captured on the coast of Africa
with 1000 negroes on board.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvanian State loan of 3,000,000 dollars has been all taken
at par by the Philadelphians, and the offers for the Maine loan at par
and up to 4 per cent prem. largely exceeded the amount required.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuter's office
yesterday (Friday):—</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The Civil War in America</hi>.—New York, June
27.—General Banks has arrested the Marshal of Baltimore on a charge of
treason (an immense quantity of ammunition having been found on his
premises), and has appointed a provost-marshal for the city.  The
British ship America, bound to Charleston with contraband of war, has
been captured and brought to Philadelphia.  The British ship
Forfarshire has been captured in the Gulf of Mexico by Federal ships.
The Federal Government has recognised the new provisional Government
of Virginia.</p>

<p>June 28.—An engagement has taken place at Mathias Point, on the
Potomac.  The rebels fired on a small party from the gun-boats,
killing two men and wounding several others.</p>

<p>Up to the last mails from America there is no account of an
engagement of importance; and the journals which, unhappily, adopt,
alternately, a tone of exaggeration and of flippancy, now scoff at the
incessant reports of actions of a "glorious" but perfectly valueless
character.  This in not the way to treat topics of such importance;
and we must say that in this terrible crisis the American press, with
some honourable exceptions, is not proving itself the best friend of
the nation.  It is not easy to select from the mass of rumours which
are daily flung, hot and hot, from the newspaper offices any
substantial information; but it would seem that what advantages have
yet been gained have been won by the Secessionists; while, on the
other hand, General Scott appears to be moving down forces of such
strength that he will be enabled by sheer power of numbers to compel a
Secessionist retreat, unless some act of brilliant strategy by the
South interfere with his plans.  He, a veteran General, is not
intoxicated by the enthusiasm of raw levies, and he continues to
insist upon the necessity of their being converted into soldiers by
steady and continuous drill and discipline.  An Indiana regiment is
said to have fallen into the hands of a strong body of Secessionists.
The latest item of all is that a battle is expected at Fairfax.  If it
be true that the Federal Government has resolved upon the imposition
of an income tax, the Republicans will learn something of the
sacrifices necessitated by a war.  At the same time it would be an
injustice to a generous nation to suppose that supplies will not be as
readily granted as men and arms.  The President's Message is eagerly
looked for, and is stated to be in the hands of the officials.  Report
says that Mr. Lincoln recommends a modification of the Morrill Tariff,
a course which will doubtless be delicately characterised as the
throwing a sop to the English lion.  The sympathy and good faith which
have been shown towards America by this country and its Government
enable us to take petulances with good humour; but it is too much to
ask us to forget, amid all our hatred of slavery as an institution,
that it is only a few months since the Republic—one and
indivisible—would have been indignant at England presuming to sit in
judgment upon the conduct of a single State or Territory.  The
Southerners were our brothers on the last 4th of July, and, if we are
not so quick at forgetting old ties as those who were still more
closely allied to the Secessionists, let this be imputed to the slow
habits of islanders, not to interested motives.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>
<p rend="right">In Camp, near Washington, June 6.</p>
<p>I REALLY have found it impossible to get my pen under way till now.
Since I have been down here there has been so much ground to be gone
over, such a distance between the subjects sketched, so much
information to be gleaned on all sides, that this is positively the
first opportunity I have had of writing.</p>

<p>My present head-quarters are in the camp of the 2nd New York
Regiment (of which an Engraving was given in our last Number), and I
should not be badly located were it not for the mosquitos and an
occasional night alarm, both of which disturb one's rest considerably.
The former inconvenience goes buzzing about the tent from night to
morn, singing round the restless dreamer's ears like the whirr of a
rifle-bullet, and waking him up with a start of agony as each shot
from the enemy takes effect.  The night alarms may possibly become
less frequent as our sentries gain more experience in their duties: at
present the men are green, and every rustle of the wind among the
trees, every sound that breaks the stillness of the night, is taken
for the advance of the Secessionists.  And here, south of Mason and
Dixon's line, on the borders of Virginia, every living thing that
crawls the earth or has wings commences its revels at the approach of
darkness and continues its riotous proceedings till dawn of day.  The
bull-frog and tree-toad hoarsely croak their dirges from swamp and
wood, the whip-poor-will sighs forth his melancholy plaint, the
screech-owl makes night hideous with his unearthly notes, while
myriads of fireflies snap about in every direction like the sparks
from a blacksmith's anvil, illumining the darkness with their tiny
bright lamps.  Apropos of green sentries, some very funny incidents
have occurred lately, showing their ignorance of their duties.  An
officer with whom I am acquainted was returning to his quarters at a
somewhat late hour, and had to pass through the lines of a strange
camp to reach his own.  As a matter of course, he was challenged by
the sentinel, who was a German, and in answer to the "Who comes
there?" replied, as usual, "Friend with the countersign."  Now, the
challenger should have called out "Approach, friend, and give the
countersign," instead of which he, in this instance, yelled at the top
of his voice, "Dat ish no goot! you not pass me mitout you say
Richemonte."  Richmond was the magic word before which all barriers
were to fall,  and our Lager Beer acquaintance took good care that
this knowledge should be widely diffused.  Again, the field officer of
the day, with an escort, was visiting the posts  on an unusually
gloomy night, and was brought to a stand by an Irishman with the
customary "Who comes there?"  To this the Sergeant of the escort
replied, "Grand Rounds with the countersign," and waited for the
summons to advance, instead of which Pat exclaimed in angry tones,
"Botheration to Gran Roons! who the divil is he?  I thought it was the
ralafe."  However, all this will come right in time, and it is but
justice to this young army to say that they are doing their best to
make soldiers of themselves, and in reality are succeeding
admirably.</p>

<p>On the first evening of my arrival at Washington I was honoured
with an invitation to the reception at Mr. Secretary Seward's, the
Minister of State, and on being presented was received most kindly by
him.  I found that the ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS had its place in the
American Cabinet, and my late connection with it had made my name
familiar to many whom I met in the Minister's rooms.  In the course of
a short conversation I had with the Secretary of State I was asked if
I thought of following in Mr. Russell's footsteps—that is, going
South, and I fancied I could perceive a shade of irritation at the
course our great "word-painter" had thought fit to pursue.  I
disclaimed any idea of so doing, and replied that my fortunes, at
least for the present, would be cast with the army of the Union, and
that I should study to delineate truthfully, with pen and pencil,
without prejudice one way or the other, all that came under my
observation.  I also suggested that had Mr. Russell, like myself, seen
the North as I now saw it he would not have failed in doing justice to
the single-hearted enthusiasm of those States whose best men are given
to uphold the Union and defend the honour of the national flag.  It
should be recollected that when Mr. Russell landed the insult to the
stars and stripes had not been offered at Fort Sumter, and in reality
there was very little outwardly-shown feeling among Northern people.
In opposition to this state of things "Our Special Correspondent"
found in his journey south a population perspiring enthusiasm from
every pore, and strong in their determination to fight to the last man
for what they term their State rights.  It would be difficult, indeed,
to travel among a people so confident of the justice of their cause,
and so sanguine of their ultimate success, without becoming to a
certain extent a convert to their opinions.  Southern hospitality and
southern arguments, washed down with southern claret, may be supposed
to go far to influence "the chiel amongst them taking notes;" but I
very much doubt if Mr. Russell has committed himself in any way.  Of
one thing I am very certain—that he has truthfully and graphically
given his experiences, and, it seems to me, without comment on either
side.  Be this as it may, Mr. Russell's letters have given great
umbrage to the North, and he has personally been attacked by almost
every New York paper, the <title>Herald</title> being most rabid in its remarks, and
even—I am sorry to say it—threats.  The insane ravings of this last
journal against England and Englishmen generally would do more to
create an ill feeling between the two countries than anything I have
seen published on our side of the water; but, fortunately, no
respectable person here pays the slightest attention to its
"editorials," and I do not suppose they ever obtain the honour of
being quoted at home.</p>

<p>In my last I said I would endeavour to say something about the
merits of the fratricidal quarrel dividing the North and the South.
For many years, until the election of Mr. Lincoln as President, the
Central Government of the United States had been in the hands of the
Southern party, or Democrats; and during their long period of office
they reigned supremely over the North.  Tired of this condition of
things, the Republicans, or Northern politicians, determined at last
to make an effort to overthrow the Democrats, and we all know how they
succeeded.  Aware of the storm that was brewing, and foreseeing the
probable wreck of their political bark, the late Government, composed
chiefly of Southern Ministers, prepared for eventualities by acting in
a fashion which smacks very much of treason, considering their oath to
the Constitution.  They transported all kinds of war material South;
they distributed the regular Army to remote points where it could be
of little service to the incoming Administration, and even had an eye
to its being cut off in the event of an uprising of the Southern
States; in fact, their agents were diligently preparing for the
present unfortunate state of affairs.   Even admitting the right of
the South to secede, surely it should have taken some constitutional
mode of separation instead of commencing a civil war by firing the
first shot on Fort Sumter, which the late Government had purposely
left in a defenceless state.  Is it just or generous, after enjoying
the reins of power for years, for a defeated party to excite rebellion
in the heart of a great nation and scatter a people whose emblem of
nationality has floated proudly in every known portion of the world?
What would the English people think if the Palmerston Administration
after a defeat, being obligated to resign, were to create a revolution
in the country simply because their political creed was no longer in
the ascendant?  This appears to me to be what the South has done.</p>

<p>Now, what is the distinction between the Democrat and the
Republican?  The Democrat advocates State rights and the extension of
slavery into certain territories belonging to the United States'
Government—territories that have not yet been admitted to the Union as
States in themselves.  "State rights" would seem to imply, and I
believe it does, an independent power of action in individual States
without reference to the central Government.  Such a system once
admitted would, I assume, develop itself to an extent scarcely
anticipated by those who advocate it; and, instead of a partial
Secession movement, every State would declare itself a separate
sovereignty, and the Union no longer exist.  As for the extension of
slavery, this curse should be diminished, not increased; and such is
the doctrine of the Republican party, who repudiate the idea of its
being taken to those territories where it does not exist, to the
exclusion of white labour and enterprise.  The Republicans desire the
non-extension of this evil, and are advocates of Free-Soil
institutions, so that the tide of emigration flowing into North
America may carry the energy of the white race to the cultivation of
those lands termed territories lately purchased by the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>Such are the points at issue between the North and the South, and
it remains for others more competent than myself to judge between
them.  One thing is, however, certain—the North is determined to
support the constituted Government and preserve the integrity of the
stars and stripes; and to do this she will, if need be, send her
thousands, nay, millions, to the field; and, powerful as she is, her
ultimate success cannot for a moment be doubted.</p>

<p>A few days since, while scouting about for subjects, I found myself
near the advanced posts in the neigbourhood of Fairfax Court House,
Virginia.  The latter place was in the occupation of the Confederate
troops, and orders had been issued for a reconnaissance to be made in
that direction to ascertain their numbers.  A troop of United States'
cavalry was detailed for this purpose, and they made a most gallant
charge through the village, contending against a much superior force,
and killing and wounding between twenty and thirty of the
Confederates, besides bringing off five prisoners.  I sent you a
sketch of this skirmish in my last (engraved in our Number of the 22nd
ult.).  Probably the most harassed and exposed of the Union forces are
the New York Fire Zouaves, a regiment that was recruited by the Late
Colonel Elsworth from the fire companies of the Empire City.  They
have always been in the van since the commencement of hostilities.
They were among the first to cross the Potomac into Virginia, and it
was they who lost their Colonel at the occupation of Alexandria, shot
by a Secessionist while capturing a Secession flag.  Now they are
encamped at the very advance, and there is not a night or day that
passes that their pickets are not engaged with the enemy.  I have made
you drawings of their guard turning out to support outlying companies
(engraved in our Number for June 22), and also of the burial of one of
their men killed in a skirmish close to the camp.  The sentry duty at
the front is exceedingly hazardous, and very few of those who are
posted at night expect to see another day dawn.  The country all round
is thickly covered with wood, and in the darkness the Secessionists,
acquainted with every cowpath, creep softly towards the poor fellow
pacing to and fro on the road, taking advantage of every shadow, and
profiting by the rustle of every falling leaf, until close upon him,
where either the bowie-knife or a rifle shot does the rest.  Before
assistance can reach the unfortunate sentinel the assassin-for this
kind of warfare is nothing better than assassination-has fled through
a track known only to himself, and, mounting his horse, tethered some
two or three hundred yards off, he gallops to Fairfax, to boast of the
valiant deed of which he is the hero.</p>
<p>In my next I shall give you my adventures with a scouting party,
from which I have just returned with Sketches; also a description of
the respective positions of the two armies, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>By the Jura we have received New York journals of the 27th ult.,
and telegrams to the evening of the 29th.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>There have been no movements of any importance since our last.
Mr. Lincoln and General Scott seem to be waiting for the sanction of
Congress, which was to reassemble on the 4th inst., before ordering
any further advance into Virginia.  The report of the cutting to
pieces of the Home Guard at Piedmont, and the surrounding of an
Indiana regiment at Cumberland, Maryland, by Confederates under the
command of General Johnston, was entirely without foundation.  The
Governor of Missouri, when last heard of, was marching southward, with
a view of securing the lead-mines in the south-west corner of the
State.  It was reported that Arkansas troops were on their way to aid
the State Government of Missouri against the Federal Government.  The
blockading fleet have captured the British ship Amelia, bound to
Charleston, and laden with stores said to be contraband of war—which
were iron crates, camp-ovens, equipage, and machinery.  She has been
taken to New York.  Another British ship, the Forfarshire, has been
captured in the Gulf of Mexico,—reason not stated.</p>

<p>Professor Lowe has been taking observations of the Confederate
positions near Washington in his balloon, and communicating the
results by means of an electric-telegraph apparatus which he takes up
with him, the wire of which connects with friends below.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Connection between these States and the civilised world continues
to be maintained by the telegraph and railway lines which run through
Kentucky, and by private letter-delivery companies, which have their
head-quarters in Louisville, the chief city of this neutral State.</p>

<p>The Southerners, in addition to their other wants, stand in need of
lucifer-matches and quinine.  In many places they are obliged to have
recourse to the old-fashioned tinder-box.  The demand for quinine
suggests the idea of fever and ague, so endemic in the Southern and
Western States.  A Philadelphia house refused lately to supply even a
Kentucky purchaser with this valuable drug.</p>

<p>The people of Eastern Tennessee refuse to send representatives to
the Legislature of Tennessee.  Senator Andrew Johnson, who resides in
this region, has been to Washington, and, it is said, obtained the
promise of Mr. Lincoln that his people shall receive assistance from
the Federal authorities.</p>

<p>The Federal Government have recognised the provisional Government of 
Western Virginia as the only lawful executive—the theory being that the 
regularly-appointed State Government has forfeited its rights by 
committing acts of treason against the United States.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NEUTRAL STATES.</p>

<p>General Banks has arrested Marshal Kane, the chief of the Baltimore
police, on a charge of treason, and has appointed a provost-marshal
for the city.  Marshal Kane has been sent to Fort M'Henry.  The
Baltimoreans sympathise strongly with him.</p>

<p>With Kentucky a sort of concordat has been made.  She is to execute
all United States' laws as expounded by the Federal judicature.  The
Federal troops will not invade her soil provided she does not allow it
to be occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>Thirty-four companies had volunteered their services to the Federal
Government from Kentucky.  The election returns from this State
indicate that nearly all the Union candidates for Congress have been
elected.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>According to a statement furnished by the Secretary of War to
President Lincoln for the message to Congress, about 225,000
volunteers are now mustered in the United States' service.</p>

<p>General Dembinski, the celebrated Pole, has offered his services to
the Federal Government.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>A mob has attacked the banks in Milwaukie [sic], Wisconsin.  The
military were ordered out, and arrested thirty of the rioters.  A
strict guard is kept over the gaol to prevent a rescue.  The reason
for the attack was the throwing out of the notes of several of the
State banks.</p>

<p>The French declaration of neutrality has been well received by the
New York press.  They profess to be able to see an important
difference between it and that of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The New York <title>Times</title> of the 23<hi rend="superscript">rd</hi>
ult. directs public attention to the approaching International
Exhibition of 1862.  It says in referenre [sic] to the speedy
appointment of a commission, "We know that a large number of our best
mechanicians are anxious to exhibit, and we would inquire, on their
behalf, if our Government has taken any steps in the matter.  One
day's time, expended by the proper bureau, could well be spared from
war matters, and would be ample to settle this whole business.  We
earnestly recommend this extremely important subject to the attention
of the Government: it is a subject not of temporary, but of permanent,
importance to the people."</p>

<p>The crew of the captured privateer Savannah has been thus analysed
by a New York evening paper:—the captain is a Philadelphian by birth;
the first officer and purser are South Carolinians; the sailing master
a North Carolinian.  Of the deck hands three are Irish, two are
Scotch, one each from New York and Massachusetts, and one from
Germany.  The steward is a native of Manilla, and the cook of
China.</p>

<p>Only one-third of the six per cent State loan of Indiana was taken
at satisfactory prices in New York.  The lowest offer accepted was at
15 per cent discount.</p>

<p>Northern public opinion is impatient of the Fabian tactics of
General Scott, denounces the Kentucky concordat, and suspects
treachery in the non-recall of Mr. Harvey, the newly-appointed
Minister to Portugal, and the ex-correspondent of the <title>Charleston
Mercury</title>.</p>

<p>The New York police have seized at a merchant's office a petition, 
with numerous signatures, praying the Federal Administration to suspend 
hostilities.</p>
<p>A movement is on foot in the southern portion of California to join

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charges</hi> of brutality, and even of
assassination, are rife in the Unionist camp against the
Secessionists, who, doubtless, have countercharges with which they
also could horrify us, had they, like their rivals, the ear of Europe;
for all camps are sure to be infested with desperadoes who, under the
garb of patriotism, prowl about to gratify their own evil purposes.
The sentry duty at the front of the Unionist camp is, we are told,
exceedingly hazardous, and very few of those who are posed at night
expect to see another day dawn.  The country all round is thickly
covered with wood, and in the darkness the Secessionists, acquainted
with every cowpath, creep softly towards the poor fellow pacing to and
fro on the road, taking advantage of every shadow, and profiting by
the rustle of every falling leaf, until close upon him, where either
the bowie-knife or a rifle-shot does the rest.</p>

<p>One night our Special Artist accompanied the scouting party, of
which the annexed is an Illustration, twelve miles into the enemy's
country.  The men were dressed in round slouched hats, rough flannel
blouses, and carried revolvers and bowie-knives in their belts. Two in
advance carried guns, ready cocked, keeping a sharp look out for
ambuscades on each side among the trees.  The Lieutenant in command
and our artist were in the centre.</p>

<p>Still no news of a conflict in America, but, on the contrary, news
of propositions of peace by the South, or, at all events, of a
willingness on the part of the seceders to come to terms.  The
information chiefly comes to us through channels unfriendly to the
South, but accompanied by much bluster as to the certainty of the
proposals being indignantly rejected, and we must take the whole
announcement <hi rend="italic">cum grano</hi>.  The Southerns are stated to desire to be
recognised as a State; and, if this be conceded, they are willing to
enter into commercial arrangements highly favourable to the North.
Divers of the Northern organs affect to believe that General Scott is
pursuing a Fabian policy, in order to weary out the war party, and to
permit the American mind to be familiarised with the propositions of
the South.  On the other hand, it is said that ardent members of the
Federal Government are highly displeased at his inaction, and are
perpetually calling on him to strike a blow.  There is no necessity
for crediting the veteran General with so much subtlety.  His apparent
inaction is quite comprehensible.  The gallant and disciplined regular
army at his command is small; and, though it would no doubt accomplish
brave things, as heretofore in Mexico, when it saved the honour of the
Republic, it would be madness to attempt war on a large scale until
force adequate to the occasion could be brought into play.  As soon as
General Scott has turned his volunteers into soldiers he will,
doubtless, be ready enough to fight, unless, happily, the delay shall
have rendered much fighting needless.  Sincerely do we hope to have
many an occasion for recording that we have "no important news" from
the West.</p>

<p>France has taken a step on the question of slavery which has excited
much interest.  The Emperor has formally abolished the present system
of obtaining negro labour by means of those contracts entered into
along the coasts, and which in practice, if not in theory, are just as
much slave sales as any other transaction which has ever supplied
black labour to France.  The ordinance itself will be good, and the
implied protest against slavery has perhaps a still higher value.
England is honourably associated with France in this document, and it
is gratifying to the philanthropist to note such association, for
every protest against the unholy system of slavery is a blow that
hastens its downfal [sic].</p>

<p>President Lincoln having, in his Message to Congress, called for
400,000 men to enable him to restore the seceded States to the Union,
Mr. Salmon P. Chase, of Ohio, the Secretary of the Treasury (an
official whose functions correspond with those of the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer), presented to Congress on the 5th
inst. an interesting written report, or budget, the substance of which
we proceed to give.  We premise that the fiscal year of the United
States commences on July 1 of each year.  The total estimates for the
current fiscal year (July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1862) are 318,519,582
dols. (omitting fractions of a dollar), or about 65,000,000.  To meet
this expenditure Mr. Chase thinks it advisable to raise 320,000,000
dols.  "With great deference and no little distrust of his own
judgment," he recommends that 80,000,000 dols. should be raised by
taxation, and that 240,000,000 dols. should be sought through loans.
The question, then, is how to raise this 80,000,000 dols.  His choice
is limited to duties on imports, direct taxes, and excise duties.  The
principal advantages of the system of direct taxes are found in the
sensibility with which they are felt and observed in the motives thus
arising for economy and fidelity in the administration and in the
manifest equity of distributing burdens in proportion to means rather
than in proportion to consumption.  On the other hand, the advantages
of indirect taxation by duties on imports are found in the economy of
collection, in the facility of payment, in the adaptability to the
encouragement of industry, and, above all, in the avoidance of Federal
interference with the finances of the States, whose main reliance for
revenue for all objects of State administration must necessarily be
upon levies on property.  These considerations have doubtless
determined the preference which has always been evinced by the people
of the United States for duties on imports as the chief source of
national revenue.  Only on occasions of special exigency has a resort
been had to direct taxation or to internal duties or excise.</p>

<p>But the present "Morrill" tariff will not produce anything like the
80,000,000 dols. required.  During the first quarter of the last
fiscal year the receipts on imports were only 5,527,000 dols.  The
sources of revenue most promptly to be made available must be sought
in the articles now exempt from duty or but lightly taxed.  These
articles have heretofore been taxed, and were only exempted when the
debts contracted in former wars had been fully paid.  Of the articles
now lightly taxed, sugar, and of those wholly free, tea and coffee,
are the most important.  The Secretary proposes that a duty of 2
cents per pound be laid on brown sugar, 3 cents on clayed sugar, and 4
cents on loaf and refined sugars; corresponding duties on syrup,
candy, and molasses; on coffee, 5 cents per pound; on black tea, 15
cents per pound; and on green tea, 20 cents (10d.).  These duties will
produce an additional revenue of 20,000,000 dols.  By other minor
reforms of the tariff he hopes to raise 7,000,000 dols. more, and that
the whole customs revenue for the year will reach 57,000,000 dols.
The sale of public lands and miscellaneous sources will be good for
3,000,000 dols.—making the total 60,000,000 dols.  He still wants
20,000,000 dols. more from taxes.  He must resort for this either to
direct taxes or to excises.  The Constitution requires that the former
be apportioned among the States, in the ratio of the Federal
population; the latter need only be uniform through the United States.
The Secretary is willing to be guided by Congress as to which source
of taxation he shall tap.  The value of the real and personal property
of the people of the United States, according to the Census of 1860,
is, omitting fractions, sixteen thousand million of dols.  The value
of real property is estimated at 11,272,000,000 dols., and of personal
at 4,831,000,000 dols.  The proportion of property of both
descriptions in the loyal States is—of real, 7,630,000,000, and of
personal, 3,270,000,000.  A rate of one fifth of one per cent on the
real and personal property of the loyal States would produce
21,800,000 dols., and a rate of three tenths of one per cent on the
real property alone in these States would produce 23,892,000 dolls.,
either sum being largely in excess of that required.  The difficulty
in the way of a direct tax is that in many of the States no State
valuations and no State machinery for collecting direct taxes on
property exist.  In these States it would be necessary to create an
extensive and complicated Federal machinery.  The constitutional
objection arising from the non-incidence of the tax on the
insurrectionary States amounts to nothing.  The tax will be levied in
all States alike, and the difficulty of collection cannot vitiate the
legality of the tax itself.</p>

<p>Excise duties have this to recommend them—they may be collected
more cheaply than direct taxes, by fewer agents, and with less
interference with the finances of the States.  They may also be made
to bear hard upon the luxurious classes.  If Congress should prefer
excise duties to direct taxes, or should like to combine the two
systems, the Secretary recommends duties on stills and distilled
liquors, on ale and beer, on tobacco, on bank notes, on spring
carriages, on silver ware and jewellery, and on legacies.</p>

<p>One other source Mr. Chase indicates with delight.  The property of
"rebels" and "traitors" can be confiscated to the public treasury.</p>

<p>Congress may also retrench.  Let 10 per cent be deducted from all
salaries paid by the Federal Government, and let the members abolish
the franking privilege and reduce the postal expenses.</p>

<p>Lastly, as to the 240,000,000 dols. which is to be raised by loan.
The National Debt amounted on the 1st inst. to 90,867, 828 dols.  The
Secretary finds that the capitalists of the country will advance no
more on terms which are satisfactory to him.  As the war is a people's
war he will appeal direct to the people.  He proposes to open a
national loan for 100,000,000 dollars, and for any amount beyond that,
to be issued in the form of Treasury notes or Exchequer bills, bearing
a yearly interest of 7 3-10ths per cent, to be paid half-yearly, and
redeemable after three years from date.  The interest will be equal to
a cent a day on fifty dollars, and the loan will be issued in sums of
50 dols., and any multiple thereof.  The amount of interest for
specified periods will be endorsed on the back of each note.  If
anybody thinks the rate of interest too high, the Secretary can only
say that the capitalists will not take his six per cent bonds at any
figure which would make them more advantageous to the Treasury than
the proposed national loan.  Subscription offices are to be opened
everywhere, and payment will be received in installments as low as ten
dollars.  But in case the National loan hangs fire, or does not
produce enough, the Secretary has another arrow in his quiver.  He
will ask power to issue bonds, or certificates of debt, in dollars or
pounds sterling.  These bonds are to be redeemable after the
expiration of thirty years, and bear interest at seven per cent,
payable in London, or at the United States' Treasury.  The Secretary
is pretty confident that his own countrymen are too shrewd and too
patriotic to allow many of these seven per cent bonds to go abroad,
but if they should let a few slip through their fingers they will
assuredly be eagerly snapped up in London.  As an auxiliary measure,
the Secretary returns to 10-dollar Treasury notes, payable one year
from date, and bearing interest; and in all these ways he hopes to
raise his 240,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>Having canvassed the different ways and means of raising
320,000,000 dols., the Secretary concludes by referring to the
difficulty of collecting the revenue in the ports of the so-called
Confederate States, and to the impediments to commerce raised by the
Confederate tariff.  He recommends that Congress pass a law for
closing the said ports or providing for such collection on ship-board.
Legislation is also required to enable the President to lay an inland
embargo on goods going to the insurgent districts, and to remit the
same at pleasure.  For the furtherance of all these mixed financial
and political purposes he respectfully submits a series of draught
bills to the consideration of Congress.  The energies of a great
people will, as he firmly believes, surmount all the troubles and
calamities of the present time, and, under the good hand of the God of
our fathers, out of these very troubles and difficulties build a
future which shall surpass the whole glorious past in the richness of
its blessings and benefits.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> President's Message is of a warlike
character.  Mr. Lincoln asks for 400,000 men and 400,000,000 dollars,
and his Finance Minister proposes to raise what is required by heavy
direct, and light indirect, taxation, and by a loan.  It is also
stated that a body of Secessionists had received a repulse, and that a
great battle was imminent, unless the Southerners should retreat.  It
would seem, therefore, that our brethren over the sea were about to
learn from experience the real meaning of the terrible word "war," so
flippantly bandied about by those who have hitherto known nothing of
that stern reality.  At this eleventh hour, and before any news can
arrive to operate upon the mind of Europe, let us have the melancholy
satisfaction of once more recording that England has all along
regarded this fratricidal contest with an aversion caused by nobler
motives than those which have been so ungenerously attributed to her;
that it is with grief—ay, and with something like shame—that she
beholds men who speak her own language and emulate her own
civilisation, rushing in arms upon one another; and that her earnest
anxiety is to see peace restored.  She can afford to be told that she
has interested views, she can bear to have her suggestions and her
mediation ungraciously received, but she will not the less strenuously
enter her protest against the stupidest and the wickedest way of
attempting to adjust domestic differences.  England hates slavery, and
ever will hate it; but she has no desire to behold its American
antagonists gain such a success as will leave a burning rancour in the
hearts of its advocates.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> bridge, which connects Washington
with the Virginia shore, is a mile long, and about a quarter of a mile
of the centre part is built of masonry, with low parapets, and
resembles a country road.  The remainder of the bridge is of wood.  It
is sufficiently wide to take three carriages abreast, and has two
draws—one on the Washington and one on the Virginia side.  These are
nearly always open for the passage of small armed propellers, with
which the Potomac swarms.  A company of flying artillery is stationed
on the bridge every night near the Virginia shore, with the draw
raised in front of them.  By day the passage across the bridge is
unobstructed, and waggons are constantly passing and repassing,
although, for form's sake, a company of soldiers is stationed at the
extremity of the bridge, and sentinels parade to and fro.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Europe</hi> is suffering from an
overproduction of Presidents' Messages.  Instead of the ordinary rate
of one a year, the last seven months have brought us three Messages
and one Inaugural Address, all on the same theme, and each one
differing materially in its conclusions from all the rest.  First,
there was Mr. Buchanan's Message, declaring against the constitutional
right of secession, but favouring the right of revolution, and
elaborately proving that the Constitution gave no power to either
President or Congress to "coerce" a State.  Secondly, there was
Mr. Lincoln's Inaugural, denying both the constitutional and
revolutionary right of secession, affirming the right of using force
to regain possession of the forts and arsenals, but disclaiming any
intention of subjugating a State or transcending by a hair's breadth
those limits which the Constitution imposed on the executive branch of
Government.  Third in order came Mr. Jefferson Davis's Message to his
Congress, repudiating the idea that there was any revolution (much
less rebellion) at all.  According to him, Secession was a reserved
right, and its exercise had been as legal and constitutional as any
normal operation of Government.  Latest of all, we have Mr. Lincoln's
second manifesto, in which he admits having ventured upon measures
which, "whether legal or not, were ventured upon under what appeared
to be a popular demand and a public necessity, trusting then, as now,
that Congress would readily ratify them."  There is no longer any
squeamishness about not invading or subjugating a State, and there is
an entirely new view of the relations between the States and the
Union—namely, that the latter created the former, and not the former
the latter, as was the universal previous opinion.  Nor is this all.
On the 20th inst. the Confederate Congress met at Richmond, unless,
indeed, the sanguine anticipations of the Northerners have been
realised and Richmond was then in their hands.  The reassembling of
this Congress will have extracted another Message from Mr. Davis, who
will hardly fail to improve the opportunity to demolish in the eyes of
the world the novel constitutional theory of Mr. Lincoln.  In the
complicated and interminable suit of "Jarndyce v. Jarndyce" none of
the advocates retained could speak for five minutes on the case
without being irreconcilably at issue with every other advocate on
every point of fact and law.  It is the same in the complicated and
costly suit of South v. North, only that in this there seems to be
superadded an inability in any leading counsel to be consistent even
with himself.</p>

<p>However much they may differ in their premises and conclusions, 
all these constitutional argumentations have a wonder-

ful family likeness to each other.  They are all evidently the
offspring of the legal mind.  They are all plentifully charged with
splenetic humours against the representatives of the other side.
Their utterers seem willing to go over the same ground again and
again, but the court of public opinion to which they appeal is fast
settling down to the conviction that this part of the case has been
dwelt on long enough.</p>
<p>The allusion of the President to the foreign
relations of the country will be reassuring to the soberer portion of
the Americans of the North, and is couched in terms not offensive to
the nations most nearly connected with the United States.  The inkling
he gives of his future policy towards the "rebels" is hardly definite
enough to satisfy anybody.  As it is, perhaps, the most important
passage in his Message, we quote it entire:—</p>

<p><q>Lest there be some uneasiness in the minds 
of candid men as to what is to be the course of the Government toward 
the Southern States after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, 
the Executive deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, 
to be guided by the Constitution and the laws, and that he probably will 
have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the Federal
Government relatively to the rights of the States and the people under
the Constitution than that expressed in the Inaugural Address.</q></p>

<p>That "probably" will appear ominous to the Southerners and their
sympathisers in the neutral and Northern States.  It looks as if
Mr. Lincoln felt that another "popular demand and public necessity"
might arise which would compel him to act differently towards the
defeated rebels than his unbiassed judgment would prompt, and he has
lately received a lesson on the inexpediency of making unqualified
pledges which the storm of popular passion and the march of events
render him unable to abide by.  Quite as significant as anything he
says is his utter silence about slavery.  The word does not occur from
beginning to end.  This silence harmonises with other symptoms of
Northern public opinion, from which we gather that the war is not to
have any anti-slavery tendency.  The Republicans have made a tacit
compromise with the Democrats.  The latter will continue to support
the war, provided it remain strictly one for the Union, for the flag,
for territory, for empire; and, as a price of this indispensable
support, the Republicans consent not to give an anti-slavery character
to their policy.  The disappointed parties will be those Abolitionists
proper who gave countenance to the war, not because they desired to
restore a Union with slaveowners, which they had always denounced, but
because they indulged the hope that the war must inevitably terminate
in the liberation of the enslaved race.</p>

<p>The departmental reports which accompany the President's Message
are more than usually interesting.  The Secretary of War states there
are 235,000 men now in the field.  The proud exultation with which he
makes the following confession is no more than what is warranted by
the facts of the last three months:—</p>

<p><q>At the present moment the Government 
presents the striking anomaly of being embarrassed by the generous 
outpouring of volunteers to sustain its action.  Instead of labouring 
under the difficulty of monarchical Governments, the want of men to 
fill its armies (which in other countries has compelled a resort to 
forced conscriptions), one of its main difficulties is to keep down 
the proportions of the army and to prevent it from swelling beyond 
the actual force required.</q>
</p>

<p>There is manifestly not only no lack, but a superabundance, of men.
But what as to money?  For this we must consult the lucid report of
the Secretary of Treasury.  He wants for the current fiscal year
320,000,000 dollars.  Of this he proposes to raise by taxation only
one-fourth; the other three-fourths are to be supplied by loans.  This
would be deemed an improvident way of beginning a war in Europe; but,
considering that the National Debt of the United States is only
90,000,000 dollars, the Northerners are, perhaps, entitled to more
latitude in the way of borrowing than could decently be claimed by any
more prodigal nation whose ancestors had long since sown all the wild
oats there were to sow.  The Secretary of War boasts of his surplus of
men; but the Financial Secretary does not proclaim any plethora of
cash.  On the contrary, the multitude of shapes which he gives to his
loan proposals, the desire to make them popular, the high rate of
interest offered—amounting in the case of the "national loan" to seven
and three-tenths per cent—show that he is far from confident of the
strength of his position.  Scrutinising the report more closely, we
discover a confession that the capitalists have failed him.  United
States' Six per Cents are now selling at fifteen per cent discount,
and the Secretary owns that he has been unable to get any bids for a
new loan at par, and only a very small quantity at rates varying from
eighty-five to ninety.  "It needs no further argument to work the
conviction that, under the exiting laws, little or nothing of the
required sum can be realised."  The moneyed men having failed him, he
appeals to those of smal [sic] means.  He announces a national loan,
on the French pattern, in Exchequer bills of the low figure of fifty
dollars.  He also hopes to draw upon the resources of British
capitalists by offering to issue bonds in sterling money to bear seven
per cent interest, payable in London.  It must have gone hard with a
patriotic Secretary before he could bring himself to make such a
proposal; but it is another indication of the low estimate he places
on the patriotism of the men who, with a larger amount of money in
their banks wanting investment than was ever known before, demanded on
a recent occasion twelve and even seventeen per cent from their
Government at a moment of danger, and when it was at their mercy.</p>

<p>The present war is a people's war, and must be supported, if at
all, by the people's money.  Will it be so supported?  This is the
great question of the day.  Will the popular loan be as successful in
the United States as in France?  This remains to be seen.  But if it
shall prove a failure the exhibition of northern patriotism will have
been partial and incomplete.  Severe critics will say myriads were
eager to fight, but few were willing to pay.  They will account for
the multitude of recruits by pointing to the state of the American
labour market.  A very busy population suddenly found its ordinary
employments stopped by a political crisis.  That crisis, instead of
coming to an end, only became more severe and widely extended.  The
working classes became moody, and began to suffer.  Suddenly the
Government called the unwillingly idle and suffering people to arms.
What wonder they rushed to the recruiting dpts?  What 
other resource had they left?  This is the construction cynical critics 
will put upon the popular uprising if the national loan fails; and even 
candid and friendly minds will be unable to distinguish to how great an extent
the genuine patriotism which raised an army of 300,000 volunteers in
three months was alloyed by less chivalric impulses.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Etna at Queenstown, and the Nova Scotian at
Londonderry, we have received news to the 13th inst.</p>


<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The Confederate ship-of-war Sumter ran the blockade off the port of
Charleston, and escaped to sea.  The privateer Jefferson Davis has
captured five Northern vessels  off Cape Halteras [sic], and sent them
into unblockaded Southern ports.  Six revenue-cutters have been
dispatched from New York and Boston in pursuit of these marauders.</p>

<p>On land the fighting has been confined to General M'Lellan's
division in Western Virginia, and General Lyon's in Missouri.  The
former division attacked the intrenched camp of the Confederates,
numbering 2000 men, at Rich Mountain, near Beverley.  The Confederates
were routed, and all their guns, camp equipage, and waggons were
captured.  Sixty Confederates and twenty Unionists were killed in the
encounter.</p>

<p>In Missouri a battle occurred at Carthage on the 5th inst.  1200
Federalists attacked 4000 State troops, and retired with a loss of
eight men and forty-five wounded.</p>

<p>On the 12th Colonel Smith routed another body of State troops at
Monroe, Missouri.</p>

<p> General Patterson is still at Martinsburg, where he has received
large reinforcements.  General Johnson, at the head of 16,000
Confederates, is stationed at Bunker's Hill, a place seven miles south
of Martinsburg.</p>

<p rend="center">CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>No one is allowed to leave Richmond in any direction without a passport.</p>
<p>Colonel Taylor, who had been sent with despatches from Mr. Davis to
Mr. Lincoln under the protection of a flag of truce, was sent back
without an answer, his communication being of too frivolous a nature.
It is supposed that it related to an exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Congress reassembled on the 4th inst.  Senator Johnson, of
Tennessee[,] and five representatives from Western Virginia, were the
only members present from any portion of the seceding States.  The
President's Message was received on the 5th.  We give this important
State paper in full in the Supplement at page 96.</p>

<p>Both Houses of Congress are busy at work legalising everything the
President did during the recess, and voting men and money in excess
even of what the Cabinet demanded.  In pursuance of this policy
Congress has determined to consider nothing at this Session but the
naval and military appropriations, and the financial measures
connected therewith.</p>

<p>A resolution passed the House of Representatives calling on the
President for the correspondence which had taken place in consequence
of the "insolent and aggressive" conduct of Spain in the invasion of
San Domingo.  The President replied that it was not advisable to
produce the correspondence at present.</p>

<p>On the motion of Mr. Lovejoy, of Illinois, a man of Radical
Anti-Slavery opinions, the House passed, by a vote of 92 against 55,
the following resolutions:—1 .  "That in the judgment of this House it
is no part of the duty of the soldiers of the United States to capture
or return fugitives slaves."  2.  "That the Committee on the Judiciary
be instituted to inquire into the expediency of repealing the law
called the 'Fugitive Slave Law.' "</p>

<p rend="center">NEUTRAL STATES.</p>

<p>A State Convention of the people of Delaware, held at Dover, to
consider the position of that State towards the contending Powers,
passed resolutions favouring a recognition of the independence of the
Confederate States as preferable to the continuance of civil war, and
expressing a fear lest the doctrines and measures of the war party
should lead to the subversion of the State Governments, and the
erection of a consolidated Government on the ruins of the Federal
Constitution.</p>

<p>The Baltimoreans are awed into quiet by the military occupation of
their city by General Banks's division.</p>

<p>In St. Louis the printing matriel of a States-rights' journal has
been seized by General Lyon, the Federal commander.</p>

<p rend="center">NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>The New York merchants have held a meeting to petition Congress to
pass a bankrupt law.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Legislature has refused to ratify a constitutional
amendment, passed by a previous Legislature, which conferred the right
of suffrage on coloured citizens.  The amendment is consequently
lost.</p>

<p>The wife of Professor Longfellow, the poet, was burnt to death at
Boston on the 10th.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Before</hi> the introduction of railways
facility of communication, upon which the prosperity of America
depended, rendered the perfection of lake and river steamers a matter
of such vital importance that all the natural mechanical ingenuity
peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon race became taxed to the utmost to
construct the most perfect class of steam-vessels adapted to the
peculiar traffic of the locality they were to be employed in.  High
speed, sleeping and feeding accommodation for the passengers, and
shallow draught of water—requisites common to nearly all American
vessels—have given the present form and character to the steamers used
throughout the United States and the British provinces.</p>

<p>An examination of the construction of these vessels, and the
innumerable details and contrivances necessary in them, give one a
very high idea of the mechanical skill and inventive powers of the
American people: from the colossal beam-engine which propels her down
to the minutest fittings-up of the bed-cabins, the barber's shop, or
the lavatories, everything that ingenuity can devise for making things
perfect has been done.  We cannot say that we have observed the same
attention to those details upon which the comforts of the passengers
so much depend on board English ships.  It arises from this cause—that
in America the building and fitting of the cabins is done by a class
of people who devote themselves entirely to such work and study to
attain perfection at it.  In England the shipbuilder who designs the
ship applies his whole ability to perfecting the hull, rigging, and
fittings of the deck, and doubtless builds a vessel better adapted to
bear the rude handling of stormy, winter seas than is produced in any
other part of the world; but cabin comforts he despises, and thinks
lubbers only require them, so leaves it pretty much to ship-joiners
and inferior people, who do them all after one plan, whether the
vessel be intended to navigate the Baltic in winter or the Red Sea and
Indian Ocean in winter.</p>

<p>There is also another reason why a difference should exist in the
general characteristics of American and English steamers.  The latter
[sic] vessels are nearly always running long passages on an even keel
and in comparatively smooth water, their rivers, lakes, and great
sounds and estuaries being of that character; while in England we have
scarcely any long journeys to make by water unless we cross either of
the Channels or the North Sea, in which case the vessel, though she
start from London-bridge, must be in every respect such a sufficient
sea-boat that she could cross the great Atlantic itself, for none can
tell but that, in her little voyage to Boulogne, Calais, Rotterdam, or
Hull, she may have to encounter weather as bad as, if not worse than,
any she might fall in with in a passage to New York.</p>

<p>Steam navigation in America commenced upon the Hudson.  It is about
fifty years since that Fulton placed his first steamer, the Clerimont
[sic], upon that river; and only one little steam-vessel was then
running in England—that was the Charlotte Dundas—Symington's boat—upon
the Forth of Clyde Canal.  Now all the seas, rivers, and great lakes
in the world are navigated by steamers.  In the important point of
speed the Hudson River boats have always maintained the lead.  The
fastest steam-vessel in the world is now running there, the Daniel
Drew.  This vessel has attained the extraordinary speed of twenty-five
miles an hour without assistance from either wind or tide.</p>

<p>Our Illustration of American river-steamers, the New World, is
chosen as showing in the fullest manner the peculiarities of this
class of craft, the immense stack of sleeping-cabins, the projecting
sponsons, or guards, the remarkable manner in which the rigidity of
the hull is maintained by trussing with wooden beams, braces, iron
tie-rods, &amp;c., without which the vibration of the mass would be
terrific, while with it the whole is so steady that a passenger cannot
feel in the slightest degree either the beat of the engine or the
revolution of the paddles.</p>

<p>The boilers of this vessel are placed outside on the guards, a
singular position for such great weights, but tending much to keep the
vessel cool, as well as adding to her safety.  This class of vessel,
with more or less of top hamper in the way of cabins, is used on all
the waters of the northern and eastern States.  They navigate, also,
Long Island Sound and the Bay of Fundy; but they must not be
confounded with the class of high-pressure boats that navigate the
rivers of the southern and western States.  It is these latter that
have earned such notoriety for exploding and getting in collision,
although some terrible accidents have happened in the northern States
and on the lakes, the most recent on Lake Michigan.  The Lady Elgin
was a vessel of precisely the class we have been describing.</p>

<p>Between Boston and New York are lines of magnificent steamers.
They run in connection with the railway at Allan Point, their course
being about 146 miles by the East River and Long Island Sound.  This
distance they generally accomplish in about seven hours and a half,
including the delay in calling at New London to discharge and take in
both passengers and cargo.  They regularly maintain this high speed;
and it is a fine sight to witness the departure of quite a fleet of
these vessels every evening from their docks at New York.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Under</hi> the head of "Contraband of War" our
Special Artist has forwarded to us a characteristic sketch (herewith
engraved) of a party of slaves seeking protection in the Federal camp.
It appears that the slaves from the different plantations in Virginia
are continually going through the pickets of the Federal army, as
fugitives from their masters, and when it is proved that their owners
are fighting in the Secessionist ranks the slaves are treated as
contraband of war.</p>

<p>The incident depicted on the first page—the Capture of a United
States' Dragoon while on Picket by Guerrilla Horsemen of
Virginia—happened near our Special Artist's camping-ground at Cloud's
Mill, in the Federal Camp.  The man, while dismounted, was suddenly
set upon by seven or eight of the Confederate cavalry; and, though he
made a gallant defence, was carried off.</p>

<p>The extra Session of Congress was opened at Washington on the 4th
inst.  Thirty-nine senators were present in the Senate, including
Messrs. Johnson, of Tennessee; and Breckinridge, of Kentucky.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives was organised immediately on assembling by the election of the Hon. G. A. Grow, of Pennsylvania, for Speaker.  Mr. Grow, on taking the chair, made a strong Union address to the Congress.</p>
<p>The following is the President's Message:—</p>


<p rend="center">FELLOW-CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>

<p>Having been convened on an extraordinary occasion, as authorised by
the Constitution, your attention is not called to any ordinary subject
of legislation.  At the beginning of the present presidential term,
four months ago, the functions of the Federal Government were found to
be generally suspended within the several States of South Carolina,
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida, excepting only
those of the Post Office Department.  Within these States all the
forts, arsenals, dockyards, custom-houses, and the like, including the
moveable and stationary property in and about them, had been seized,
and were held in open hostility to this Government, excepting only
Forts Pickens, Taylor, and Jefferson, on and near the Florida coast,
and Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbour, South Carolina.  The forts
thus seized had been put in improved condition, new ones had been
built, and armed forces had been organised, and were organising, all
avowedly with the same hostile purpose.  The forts remaining in the
possession of the Federal Government in and near these States were
either besieged or menaced by warlike preparations, and especially
Fort Sumter, which was nearly surrounded by well-protected hostile
batteries, with guns equal in quality to the best of its own, and
outnumbering the latter, perhaps, ten to one.  A disproportionate
share of the Federal muskets and rifles had somehow found their way
into these States, and had been seized, to be used against the
Government.  Accumulations of the public revenue lying within them had
been seized for the same object; the navy was scattered in distant
seas, leaving but a very small part of it within the immediate reach
of the Government.  Officers of the Federal army had resigned in great
numbers, and of those resigning a large number had taken up arms
against the Government.  Simultaneously, and in common with all this,
the purpose to sever the Federal Union was openly avowed.  In
accordance with this purpose an ordinance had been adopted in each of
these States  declaring the States respectively to be separated from
the National Union.  A formula for instituting a combined government
of those States had been promulgated, and this illegal organisation,
in the character of the "Confederate States," was already invoking
recognition, aid, and intervention from foreign Powers.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FORBEARANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Finding this condition of things, and believing it to be an
imperative duty upon the incoming Executive to prevent if possible the
consummation of such an attempt to destroy the Federal Union, a choice
of means to that end became indispensable.  This choice was made, and
was declared in the Inaugural Address.  The policy chosen looked to
the exhaustion of all peaceful measures before a resort to any
stronger ones; it sought only to hold the public places and property
not already wrested from the Government, and to collect the revenue,
relying for the rest on time, discussion, and the ballot-box.  It
promised a continuance of the mails, at Government expense, to the
very people who were resisting the Government, and it gave repeated
pledges against any disturbances to any of the people or any of their
rights.  Of all that which a President might constitutionally and
justifiably do in such a case, everything was forborne without which
it was believed possible to keep the Government on foot.</p>

<p>On March 5, the present incumbent's first full day in office, a
letter from Major Anderson, commanding at Fort Sumter, written on
Feb. 28, and received at the War Department on March 4, was by that
department placed in his hand.  This letter expressed the professional
opinion of the writer that reinforcements could not be thrown into
that fort within the time for his relief, rendered necessary by the
limited supply of provisions, and with the view of holding possession
of the same with a force of less than 20,000 good and well-disciplined
men.  This opinion was concurred in by all the officers of his
command, and their memoranda on the subject were made the inclosures
of Major Anderson's letter.  The whole was immediately laid before
Lieutenant-General Scott, who at once concurred with Major Anderson in
his opinion.  On reflection, however, he took full time, consulting
with other officers, both of the Army and the Navy, and at the end of
four days came reluctantly, but decidedly, to the same conclusion as
before.  He also stated, at the same time, that no such sufficient
force was then at the control of the Government, or could be raised or
brought to the ground within the time when the provisions in the fort
would be exhausted.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FORT SUMTER AFFAIR.</p>

<p>In a purely military point of view, this reduced the duty of the
Administration in the case to the mere matter of getting the garrison
safely out of the fort.  It was believed, however, that to so abandon
that position, under the circumstances, would be utterly ruinous; that
the necessity under which it was to be done would not be fully
understood; that by many it would be construed as part of a voluntary
policy; that at home it would discourage the friends of the Union,
embolden its adversaries, and go far to ensure to the latter a
recognition abroad—that, in fact, it would be our national destruction
consummated.  This could not be allowed.  Starvation was not yet upon
the garrison, and, ere it would be reached, Fort Pickens might be
reinforced.  This last would be a clear indication of policy, and
would better enable the country to accept the evacuation of Fort
Sumter.  As a military necessity, an order was at once directed to be
sent for the landing of troops from the steam-ship Brooklyn into Fort
Pickens.  This order could not go by land, but must take the longer
and slower route by sea.  The first return news from the order was
received just one week before the fall of Fort Sumter.  The news
itself was that the officer commanding the Sabine, to which vessel the
troops had been transferred from the Brooklyn, acting upon some
quasi-armistice of the late Administration, and of the existence of
which the present Administration, up to the time the order was
dispatched, had only too vague and uncertain rumors to fix attention,
had refused to land the troops to reinforce Fort Pickens, before a
crisis would be reached at Fort Sumter was impossible, rendered so by
the near exhaustion of provisions in the latter-named fort.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EXPEDITION FOR ITS RELIEF.</p>

<p>In precaution against such a conjuncture the Government had, a few
days before, commenced preparing an expedition, as well adapted as
might be, to relieve Fort Sumter, which expedition was intended to be
ultimately used or not, according to circumstances,  The strongest
anticipated case for using it was now presented, and it was resolved
to send it forward as had been intended.  In this contingency it was
also resolved to notify to the Governor of South Carolina that he
might expect that an attempt would be made to provision the fort, and,
if the attempt should not be resisted, there would be an attempt to
throw in men, arms, or ammunition, without further notice, or in case
of an attack upon the fort.  This notice was accordingly given,
whereupon the fort was attacked and bombarded to its fall, without
even awaiting the arrival of the provisioning expedition.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DESIRE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO PRESERVE THE UNION.</p>

<p>It is thus seen that the assault upon and reduction of Fort Sumter
was in no sense a matter of self-defence on the part of the
assailants.  They well knew that the garrison in the fort could, by no
possibility, commit aggression upon them; they knew, they were
expressly notified, that the giving of bread to the few brave and
hungry men of the garrison was all which would on that occasion be
attempted, unless they themselves, by resisting so much, should
provoke more.  They knew that the Government desired to keep the
garrison in the fort, not to assail them, but merely to maintain
visible possession, and thus to preserve the Union from actual and
immediate dissolution, trusting, as hereinbefore stated, to time,
discussion, and the ballot-box for final adjustment, and they assailed
and reduced the fort, for precisely the reverse object, to drive out
the visible authority of the Federal Union, and thus force it to
immediate dissolution.  That this was their object the Executive well
understood; and having said to them in the Inaugural Address, "You can
have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors," he took
pains not only to keep this declaration good, but also to keep the
case so far from injurious sophistry as that the world should not
misunderstand it.  By the affair at Fort Sumter, with its surrounding
circumstances, that point was reached.  Then and thereby the
assailants of the Government began the conflict of arms, without a gun
in sight or in expectancy to return their fire, save only the few in
the fort, sent to that harbour years before for their own protection,
and still ready to give that protection in whatever was lawful.  In
this act, discarding all else, they have forced upon the country the
distinct issue—immediate dissolution or blood.  And this issue
embraces more than the fate of these United States.  It presents to
the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic
or democracy, a government of the people by the same people, can or
cannot maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic
foes.  It presents the question whether discontented individuals, too
few in number to control the Administration according to the organic
law in any case, can always, upon the pretences made in this case, or
any other pretences, or arbitrarily without any pretence, break up the
Government, and thus practically put an end to free government upon
the earth.  It forces us to ask, "Is there in all republics this
inherent and fatal weakness?"  Must a Government of necessity be too
strong for the liberties of its own people, or too weak to maintain
its own existence?  So viewing the issue, no choice was left but to
call out the war power of the Government, and so to resist the force
employed for its destruction by force for its preservation.  The call
was made, and the response of the country was most gratifying,
surpassing in unanimity and spirit the most sanguine expectations.
Yet none of the States commonly called Slave States, except Delaware,
gave a regiment through the regular State organisation.  A few
regiments have been organised within some others of those States by
individual enterprise and received into the Government service.  Of
course, the seceded States (so called), and to which Texas had been
joined about the time of the inauguration, gave no troops to the cause
of the Union.  The border States (so called) were not uniform in their
action, some of them being almost for the Union; while in others, as
in Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas, the Union
sentiment was nearly repressed and silenced.  The course taken in
Virginia was the most remarkable, perhaps the most important.  A
Convention, elected by the people of that State to consider this very
question of disrupting the Federal Union, was in session at the
capital of Virginia when Fort Sumter fell.</p>

<p rend="center">THE COURSE OF VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>To this body the people had chosen a large majority of professed
Union men.  Almost immediately after the fall of Sumter many members
of that majority went over to the original disunion minority, and with
them adopted an ordinance for withdrawing the State from the Union.
Whether this change was wrought by their great approval of the assault
upon Sumter or their great resentment at the Government's resistance
to that assault is not definitely known, although they submitted the
ordinance for ratification to a vote of the people, to be taken on a
day then somewhat more than a month distant.  The Convention and the
Legislature, which was also in session at the same time and place,
with leading men of the State not members of either, immediately
commenced acting as if the State was already out of the Union.  They
pushed military preparations vigorously forward all over the State;
they seized the United States' Armoury at Harper's Ferry and the Navy
Yard at Gosport, near Norfolk; they received, perhaps invited, into
their State large bodies of troops, with their warlike appointments,
from the so-called seceded State; they formally entered into a treaty
of temporary alliance with the so-called Confederate States, and sent
members to their Congress at Montgomery; and, finally, they permitted
the insurrectionary Government to be transferred to their capital at
Richmond.  The people of Virginia have thus allowed this giant
insurrection to make its nest within her borders, and thus Government
has no choice left but to deal with it where it finds it, and it has
the less to regret as the loyal citizens have in due form claimed its
protection.  These loyal citizens this Government is bound to
recognise and protect as being in Virginia.  In the border States
(so-called)—in fact, the middle States—there are those who favour a
policy which they call armed neutrality—that is, an arming of these
States to prevent the Union forces passing one way or the Disunionists
the other over their soil.  This would be disunion completed.
Figuratively speaking, it would be the building of an impassable wall
along the line of separation, and yet not quite an impassable one,
for, under the guise of neutrality, it would tie the hands of the
Union men, and freely pass supplies from among them to the
insurrectionists, which it could not do as an open enemy; at a stroke
it would take all the trouble off the hands of secession, except only
what proceeds from the external blockade.  It would do for the
Disunionists that which of all things they most desire—feed them well,
and give them disunion without a struggle of their own.  It recognises
no fidelity to the Constitution—no obligation to maintain the Union;
and, while very many who have favoured it—all, doubtless, loyal
citizens—it is, nevertheless, very injurious in effect.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>Recurring to the action of the Government, it may be stated that at
first a call was made for 75,000 militia; and rapidly following this a
proclamation was issued for closing the ports of the insurrectionary
districts, by proceedings in the nature of a blockade.  So far all was
believed to be strictly legal.</p>

<p>At this point the insurrectionists announced their purpose to enter
upon the practice of privateering.</p>

<p>Other calls were made for volunteers to serve three years, unless
sooner discharged, and also for large additions to the regular army
and navy.  These measures, whether strictly legal or not, were
ventured upon under what appeared to be a popular demand and a popular
necessity, trusting, then as now, that Congress would readily ratify
them.  It is believed that nothing has been done beyond the
constitutional competency of Congress.  Soon after the first call for
militia it was considered a duty to authorise the commanding General,
in proper cases, according to his discretion, to suspend the privilege
of the writ of habeas corpus, or, in other words, to arrest and
detain, without resort to the ordinary processes and forms of law,
such individuals as he might deem dangerous to the public safety.
This authority has purposely been exercised, but very sparingly.
Nevertheless, the legality and propriety of what has been done under
it are questioned, and the attention of the country has been called to
the proposition that one who has sworn to take care that the laws be
faithfully executed should not himself violate them.  Of course some
consideration was given to the question of power and propriety before
the matter was acted upon.  The whole of the laws which were required
to be faithfully executed were being resisted and failing of execution
in nearly one-third of the States.  Must they be allowed to finally
fail of execution, even had it been perfectly clear that, by the use
of the means necessary to their execution, some single law made in
such extreme tenderness of the citizen's liberty that, practically, it
relieves more of the guilty than the innocent, should to a very
limited extent be violated?  To state the question more directly, are
all the laws but one to go unexecuted, and the Government itself to go
to pieces lest that one should be violated.  Even in such a case would
not the official oath be broken if the Government should be overthrown
when it was believed that disregarding the single law would tend to
preserve it.  But it was not believed that this question was
presented—it was not believed that any law was violated.  The
provision of the Constitution that the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or
invasion, the public safety may require it, is equivalent to a
provision that such privilege may be suspended when, in cases of
rebellion or invasion, the public safety does require it.  It was
decided that we have a case of rebellion, and that the public safety
does require the qualified suspension of privilege of the writ, which
was authorised to be made.  Now, it is insisted that Congress, and not
the Executive, is vested with this power; but the Constitution itself
is silent as to which or who is to exercise the power, and, as the
provision was plainly made for a dangerous emergency, it cannot be
believed that the framers of the instrument intended that in every
case the danger should run its course until Congress could be called
together, the very assembling of which might be prevented, as was
intended in this case, by the rebellion.  No more extended argument is
now afforded, as an opinion at some length will probably be presented
by the Attorney-General.  Whether there shall be any legislation on
the subject, and if so what, is submitted entirely to the better
judgment of Congress.  The forbearance of this Government had been so
extraordinary and so long continued as to lead some foreign nations to
shape their action as if they supposed the early destruction of our
national Union was probable.  While this, on discovery, gave the
Executive some concern, he is now happy to say that the sovereignty
and rights of the United States are now everywhere practically
respected by foreign Powers, and a general sympathy with the country
is manifested throughout the world.</p>

<p>The reports of the Secretaries of the Treasury, War, and the Navy
will give the information in detail deemed necessary and convenient
for your deliberation and action, while the Executive and all the
Departments will stand ready to supply omissions or to communicate new
facts considered important for you to know.</p>

<p rend="center">DEMAND FOR 400,000 MEN AND 400,000,000 DOLLARS.</p>

<p>It is now recommended that you give the legal means for making this
contest a short and decisive one; that you place at the control of the
Government for that purpose at least 400,000 men and 4,000,000
dollars.  That number of men is one-tenth of those of proper age
within the regions where apparently all are willing to engage, and the
sum is less than a twenty-third part of the money value owned by the
men who seem ready to devote the whole.  A debt of 600,000,000 dollars
now is a less sum per head than was the debt of our Revolutionists
when we came out of that struggle, and the money value in the country
bears even a greater proportion to what it was then than does the
population.  Surely, each man has as strong a motive now to preserve
our liberties as each had then to establish them.</p>

<p>A right result at this time will be worth more to the world than ten
times the men and ten times the money.  The evidence reaching us from
the country leaves no doubt that the material for the work is
abundant, and that it needs only the hand of legislation to give it
legal sanction, and the hand of the Executive to give it practical
shape and efficiency.  One of the greatest perplexities of the
Government is to avoid receiving troops faster than it can provide for
them: in a word, the people will save their Government if the
Government itself will only do its part indifferently well.  It might
seem at first thought to be of little difference whether the present
movement at the South be called secession or rebellion; the movers,
however, well understand the difference.  At the beginning they knew
they could never raise their treason to any respectable magnitude by
any name which implies violation of law.  They knew the people
possessed as much of moral sense, as much of devotion to law and
order, and as much pride in its reverence for the history and
government of their common country as any other civilised and
patriotic people.  They knew they could make no advancement directly
in the teeth of these strong and noble sentiments.  Accordingly, they
commenced by an insidious debauching of the public mind; they invented
an ingenious sophism, which, if conceded, was followed by perfectly
logical steps through all the incidence of the complete destruction of
the Union.  The sophism itself is, that any State of the Union may
consistently with the nation's Constitution, and therefore lawfully
and peacefully, withdraw from the Union without the consent of the
Union or of any other State.</p>

<p rend="center">SOPHISMS OF THE SECESSIONISTS.</p>

<p>The little disguise that the supposed right is to be exercised only
for a just cause, themselves to be the sole judges of its justice, is
too thin to merit any notice with rebellion.  Thus, sugar-coated, they
have been drugging the public mind of their section for more than
thirty years, until at length they have brought many good men to a
willingness to take up arms against the Government the day after some
assemblage of men have enacted the farcical pretense of taking their
State out of Union, who could have been brought to no such thing the
day before.  This sophism derives much, perhaps the whole, of its
currency from the assumption that there is some omnipotent and sacred
supremacy pertaining to a State—to each State of our Federal Union.
Our States have neither more nor less power than that reserved to them
in the Union by the Constitution, no one of them having been a State
out of Union.  The original ones passed into the Union even before
they cast off their British colonial dependence, and the new ones come
into the Union directly from a condition of dependence, excepting
Texas, and even Texas, in its temporary independence, was never
designated a State.  The new ones only took the designation of States
on coming into the Union, while that name was first adopted for the
old ones in and by the Declaration of Independence.  Therein the
united colonies were declared to be free and independent States.  But
even then the object plainly was not to declare their independence of
one another of the Union, but directly the contrary, as their mutual
pledge and their mutual action before, at the time, and afterwards,
abundantly show.  The express plighting of faith by each and all of
the original thirteen States in the articles of confederation, two
years later, that the Union shall be perpetual, is most conclusive,
having never been States either in substance or in name outside of the
Union.  Whence this magical omnipotence of State rights asserting a
claim of power to lawfully destroy the Union itself?</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE STATES NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p>Much is said about the sovereignty of the States; but the word,
even, is not in the national Constitution, nor, as is believed, in any
of the State Constitutions.  What is a Sovereignty in the political
sense of the term?  Would it be far wrong to define it to be a
political community without a political superior?  Tested thus, no one
of our States, except Texas, was a Sovereignty; and even Texas gave up
the character on coming into the Union, by which act she acknowledged
the Constitution of the United States, and the laws and treaties of
the United States made in pursuance of the Constitution, to be for her
the supreme law.  The States have their status in the Union, and they
have no other local status.  If they break from this they can only do
so against law and by revolution.  The Union, and not themselves
separately, procured their independence and their liberty, by conquest
or purchase.  The Union gave each of them whatever of independence and
liberty it has.  The Union is older than any of the States, and, in
fact, it created them as States.  Originally, some dependent colonies
made the Union, and in turn the Union threw off their old dependence
for them, and made them States such as they now are.  Not one of them
ever had a State Constitution independent of the Union.  Of course, it
is not forgotten that all the new States formed their Constitutions
before they entered the Union, nevertheless dependent upon and
preparatory to coming into the Union.  Unquestionably, the States have
the power and rights reserved to them in and by the national
Constitution.  But among those surely are not included all conceivable
powers, however mischievous or destructive, but at most such only as
were known in the world as governmental powers; and certainly a power
to destroy the Government itself had never been known as a
governmental power.  This relative matter of national power and State
rights, as a principle, is no other than the principle of generality
and locality; whatever concerns the whole should be confined to whole
general government, while whatever concerns the State should be left
exclusively to the State.  This is all there is of original principle
about it.  Whether the National Constitution, in defining boundaries
between the two, has applied the principle with exact accuracy is not
to be questioned.  We are all bound by that defining without
question.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SECESSION FALLACY.</p>

<p>What is now combated is the position that secession is consistent
with the Constitution, is lawful and peaceful.  It is not contended
that there is any express law for it, and nothing should ever be
implied as law which leads to unjust or absurd consequences.  The
nation purchased with money the countries out of which several of
these States were formed.  Is it just that they shall go off without
leave, and without refunding?  The nation paid very large sums—in the
aggregate, I believe, nearly a hundred millions, to relieve Florida of
the aboriginal tribes.  Is it just that she shall now be off without
consent, or without any return?  The nation is now in debt for money
applied to the benefit of these (so-called) Seceding States in common
with the rest.  Is it just either that creditors should go unpaid, or
the remaining States pay the whole?  A part of the present national
debt was contracted to pay the old debts of Texas.  Is it just that
she shall leave, and pay no part of this herself?  Again, if one State
may secede, so may another; and when all shall have seceded none will
be left to pay the debts.  Is this quite just to creditors?  Did we
notify them of this sage view of ours when we borrowed their money?
If we now recognise this doctrine, by allowing the seceders to go in
peace, it is difficult to see what we can do if others chose to go or
to extort terms upon which they will promise to remain.  The seceders
insist that our Constitution admits of secession.  They have assumed
to make a national Constitution of their own, in which, of necessity,
they have either discarded or retained the right of secession as they
insist it exists in ours.  If they have discarded it, they thereby
admit that, on principle, it ought not exist in ours; if they have
retained it, by their own con-<pb n="97"/>struction of ours
they show that, to be consistent, they must secede from one another
whenever they shall find it the easiest way of settling their debts or
effecting any selfish or unjust object.  The principle itself is one
of disintegration, and upon which no Government can possibly endure.
If all States save one should assert the power to drive that one out
of the Union, it is presumed the whole class of seceded politicians
would at once deny the power and denounce the act as the greatest
outrage upon State rights.  But, suppose that precisely the same act,
instead of being called driving the one out, should be called the
seceding of the others from that one, it would be exactly what the
seceders claim to do, unless, indeed, they make the point that the
one, because it is a minority, may rightfully do what the others,
because they are a majority, may not rightfully do.</p>


<p rend="center">THE REBEL POLITICIANS IGNORE THE PEOPLE.</p>

<p>These politicians are subtle and profound in the rights of
minorities.  They are not partial to that power which made the
Constitution and speaks from the preamble calling itself "We, the
people."  It may well be questioned whether there is to-day a majority
of the legally-qualified votes of any State, except, perhaps, South
Carolina, in favour of disunion.  There is much reason to believe that
the Union men are the majority in many, if not in every one, of the
so-called Seceded States.  The contrary has not been demonstrated in
any one of them.  It is ventured to affirm this even of Virginia and
Tennessee; for the result of an election had in military camps, where
their bayonets are all one side of the question voted upon, can
scarcely be considered as demonstrating popular sentiment.  At such an
election all that large class who are at once for the Union, and
against coercion, would be coerced to vote against the Union.  It may
be affirmed without extravagance that the free institutions we enjoy
have developed the powers and improved the condition of our whole
people beyond any example in the world.  Of this we now have a
striking and impressive illustration.  So large an army as the
Government has now on foot was never before known without a soldier in
it but who has taken his place there of his own free choice.  But,
more than this, there are many single regiments whose members, one and
another, possess full practical knowledge of all the arts, sciences,
professions, and whatever else, whether useful or elegant, is known in
the whole world, and there is scarcely one from which there could not
be selected a President, a Cabinet, a Congress, and perhaps a Court,
abundantly competent to administer the Government itself.  Nor do I
say this is not true also in the army of our late friends, now
adversaries, in this contest.  But it is so much more the reason why
the Government which has conferred such benefits on both them and us
should not be broken up.  Whoever, in any section, proposes to abandon
such a Government would do well to consider in deference to what
principle it is that he does it-what better he is likely to get in its
stead—whether the substitute will give, or be intended to give, so
much of good to the people?  There are some foreshadowings on this
subject.  Our adversaries have adopted some declarations of
independence, in which, unlike the good old one penned by Jefferson,
they omit the words "all men are created equal."  Why?  They have
adopted a temporary national Constitution, in the preamble of which,
unlike our good old one, signed by Washington, they omit "We, the
people," and substitute "We, the deputies of the sovereign and
independent States."  Why?  Why this deliberate pressing out of view
the rights of men and the authority of the people.  This is
essentially a people's contest.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LEADING OBJECT OF THE UNION.</p>

<p>On the side of the Union it is a struggle for maintaining in the
world that form and substance of government whose leading object is to
elevate the condition of men, to lift artificial weights from all
shoulders, to clear the paths of pursuit for all, and to afford all an
unfettered share and a fair chance in a race of life, yielding to
partial and temporary departures from necessity.  This is the leading
object of the Government for whose existence we contend.</p>

<p rend="center">FIDELITY OF THE ARMY AND NAVY.</p>

<p>I am most happy to believe that the plain people understand and
appreciate this.  It is worthy of note that while in this the
Government's hour of trial large numbers of those in the army and navy
who have been favoured with offices have resigned, and proved false to
the hand which pampered them, not one common soldier or common sailor
is known to have deserted his flag.  Great honour is due to those
officers who remained true despite the example of their treacherous
associates; but the greatest honour, and the most important fact of
all, is the unanimous firmness of the common soldiers and common
sailors.  To the last man, so far as known, they have successfully
resisted the traitorous efforts of those whose commands but an hour
before they obeyed as absolute law.  This is the patriotic instinct of
plain people.  They understand without an argument that the destroying
the Government which was made by Washington means no good to them.
Our popular Government has often been called an experiment.  Two
points in it our people have settled—the successful establishing and
the successful administering of it.  One still remains—its successful
maintenance against a formidable internal attempt to overthrow it.</p>

<p>It is now for them to demonstrate to the world that those who can
fairly carry an election can also suppress a rebellion; that ballots
are the rightful and peaceful successors of bullets, and that when
ballots have fairly and constitutionally decided there can be no
successful appeal back to bullets; that there can be no successful
appeal except to ballots themselves.  At succeeding elections such
will be a great lesson of peace, teaching men that what they cannot
take by an election neither can they take by war—teaching all the
folly of being the beginners of a war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE GOVERNMENT AND THE SOUTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>Lest there should be some uneasiness in the minds of candid men as
to what is to be the course of the Government towards the Southern
States after the rebellion shall have been suppressed, the Executive
deems it proper to say it will be his purpose then, as ever, to be
guided by the Constitution and the laws, and that he probably will
have no different understanding of the powers and duties of the
Federal Government, relatively to the rights of the States and the
people under the Constitution, than that expressed in the Inaugural
Address.</p>

<p>He desires to preserve the Government, that it may be administered
for all as it was administered by the men who made it.  Loyal citizens
everywhere have the right to claim this of their Government, and the
Government has no right to withhold or neglect it.  It is not
perceived that in giving it there is any coercion, any conquest, or
any subjugation, in any just sense of these terms.</p>

<p>The Constitution provided, and all the States have accepted the
provision, "That the United States shall guarantee to every State in
this Union a republican form of government."  But if a State may
lawfully go out of the Union, having done so, it may also discard the
republican form of government; so that to prevent its going out is an
indispensable means to the end of maintaining the guarantee mentioned,
and, when an end is lawful and obligatory, the indispensable means to
it are also lawful and obligatory.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DUTY OF THE PRESIDENT.</p>

<p>It was with the deepest regret that the Executive found the duty of
employing the war power in defence of the Government.  Forced upon
him, he could but perform this duty or surrender the existence of the
Government.  No compromise by public servants could, in this case, be
a cure; not that compromises are not often proper, but that no popular
Government can long survive a marked precedent that those who carry an
election can only save the Government from immediate destruction by
giving up the main point upon which the people gave the election.  The
people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their
own deliberate decisions.</p>

<p>As a private citizen, the Executive could not have consented that
these institutions shall perish, much less could he in betrayal of so
vast and so sacred a trust as these free people had confided to him.
He felt that he had no moral right to shrink, nor even to count the
chances of his own life in what might follow.</p>

<p>In full view of his great responsibility, he has so far done what
he has deemed his duty.  You will now, according to your own judgment,
perform yours.  He sincerely hopes that your views and your actions
may so accord with his as to assure all faithful citizens who have
been disturbed in their rights of a certain and speedy restoration to
them under the Constitution and the laws, and, having thus chosen our
course, without guile and with pure purpose, let us renew our trust in
God, and go forward without fear and with manly hearts.</p>

<p>The New York Post says the Wall-street bankers on the 9th subscribed
the full amount of a five-million loan in forty minutes.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the North Briton at Londonderry we have telegrams
to the 20th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>Major-General M'Clellan has won a succession of victories over the
Confederates in Western Virginia, which enables him to report that he
firmly believes Secession is killed in that section of the country.
On the 12th a division of Federals, led by General Rosencrantz, drove
the enemy from an intrenched camp at Rich Mountain, near Beverley.  On
the 13th General M'Clellan pushed on to Beverely, and captured six
brass cannon, of which one was rifled, and all the camp equipage and
transportation waggons.  The enemy lost in killed and wounded 150 men,
and at least 100 prisoners.  The Federals lost in this second
engagement 11 killed and 35 wounded.  On the same day General
M'Clellan received from Colonel Pegrain (not Pogram) propositions for
the surrender of his whole command, numbering 600 men.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 14th, General Garnett and his forces were
routed at Carrackford, near St George, and his baggage and one gun
taken.  General Garnett was killed in the engagement.  The Confederate
loss was not far from 200 killed and a number of prisoners.  The
Federals report a loss of 13 killed and 40 wounded.  The troops
engaged in these affairs were chiefly from Ohio and Indiana.</p>

<p>The main body of the Federal Army of the centre, numbering 55,000
men, and commanded by General M'Dowell, began its march towards
Richmond on the 17th ult.  They met with no serious resistance until
they reached Dulbram, a fortified position, three miles from Manassas
Junction.  On the 18th the advanced guard of the Federals attacked
this position and was repulsed.  Afterwards, however, the position was
carried.  At the last accounts the two armies were within a mile of
each other near Manassas Junction, and a battle seemed inevitable on
the next day (Sunday) or Monday, the 22nd ult.</p>

<p>General Patterson, who was last heard of at Martinsburg, has been
superseded by Major-General Banks.  General Dix succeeds General Banks
in command at Baltimore.</p>

<p>The Federal Government has decided that no more fugitive slaves
shall be allowed in camp.</p>

<p>In Missouri Colonel Siegel has gained another advantage over the
State troops.</p>

<p>The Confederate privateer Sumpter, which escaped from New Orleans,
made for Cuba, where she seized eight Northern vessels, six of which
were run into Cienfuegos and one was burned.  The Governor-General of
Cuba allowed the privateer to coal and water, but retained the prizes.
One of them which had been sent home under a prize crew was taken into
a Northern port, the crew revolting and being unwilling to return to
the Sumpter.  Two of this crew were Englishmen.</p>

<p>Galveston, Texas, was blockaded on the 2nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The opposition to the war party in Congress never divides more than
ten in the House of Representatives, and not above half that number in
the Senate.  Four Northern Democrats only adhere to the cause of
peaceable separation.  The chief speakers against the war in the
Senate are—Mr. Breckenridge, of Kentucky, and in the House
Messrs. Burnett, of the same State, and Vallandingham, of Ohio.</p>

<p>Messrs. Carlile and Wiley, of Western Virginia, have been admitted
to seats in the Senate, as lawfully representing Virginia, in lieu of
Messrs. Hunter and Mason, expelled for treasonable conduct.</p>

<p>The military authorities exercise a censorship over the telegrams
sent by correspondents at Washington to the Northern press, and will
not let anything pass the knowledge of which may be of service to the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury raised 5,000,000 dols. in Treasury
notes, at par, in the New York money market in forty minutes; the
energetic course of the Government in suppressing the revolution
having infused new confidence into the capitalists.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The eighty-fifth anniversary of American Independence was observed
with the usual éclat throughout the South.</p>

<p>Vice-President Stephens is delivering public harangues in the Gulf
States in behalf of the produce loan of the Southern Government.</p>

<p>The usual mail facilities are still extended to the people of East
Tennessee by the Federal Government in consideration of their
loyalty.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>There is much suffering among the working classes and the families
of the volunteers in New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis.  In New
York the Common Council have voted 500,000 dols. towards the relief of
the needy.</p>

<p>The particulars of the accident which proved fatal to
Mrs. Longfellow are as follow:—She was engaged in making wax seals in
the library for the amusement of her two youngest children, when her
dress caught fire from a match with which she was melting the wax.
She had on a light summer dress, which was all in flames in a moment.
Mr. Longfellow, who was in his study near by, ran to her assistance,
and succeeded in extinguishing the flames, with considerable injury to
himself, but too late to save the life of his wife.  She was the
daughter of the Hon. Nathan Appleton, of Boston, and leaves a family
of five children—three of them daughters and two sons.</p>

<p>The trade returns of the port of New York show to what an extent the
import trade of that port has suffered in consequence of the war.  For
the week ending July 13 there were imported of dry goods only 226,388
dols. worth, against 1,776,456 dols. for the corresponding week of
last year, and 2,630,240 dols. in 1859.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sad</hi> news is, in all probability, crossing
the Atlantic.  The last mails have spoken of the advance of the
Federal army upon the Confederates, and we hear of a repulse of the
former, and then of its success in carrying a disputed position.  This
information, of course, comes through Northern channels, and we have
not yet learned to accept, unhesitantly, every statement so
transmitted.  But there seems no reason to doubt that the armies were
drawing very close, and if the journals that "expect" a battle "to-day
or to-morrow" are to be relied upon it could hardly be many days
before thousands of men, speaking the same language, and but the other
day proud of being governed by the same rulers, would be hurled upon
one another in fierce conflict.  A spot called Manassas Junction was
indicated as the probable scene of the expected engagement. Some
superseding of Federal Generals on the eve of fighting might not seem
a good augury for the North; but, if the accounts as to the numbers of
the forces be trustworthy, it is difficult to understand how an
experienced soldier like General Scott can fail to be victorious.
Private letters say that the authorities at Washington have no such
ideas as are promulgated by journalists about bringing the war to a
rapid termination, and that they do not contemplate the final
subjugation of the South in less than two campaigns.  In far less time
than such protracted operations will require the pacification of the
States will, we hope, be effected by other agency.  Meantime, we await
the arrival of the first important news that has been dispatched since
the declaration—we do not to say of war—but of "action" by the
belligerents.</p>

<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.</hi>)</p> 

<p rend="right">Federal Camp, Virginia, July 7.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">There</hi> are many, no doubt, who on reading a 
correspondent's letter envy him the life of excitement he is supposed to 
lead with an army in the field.  They would gladly forego their home 
comforts for the assumed pleasures of a camp existence, convinced that 
a night between regulation blankets, on a straw mattress, with rank grass for a
bedstead, is as comfortable as the peaceful slumber they enjoy betwixt
their own white sheetings.  Breakfast at nine, lunch at two, and
dinner at six are conventionalities they are prepared to repudiate,
preferring infinitely for the time being a simple diet of simple
luxuries eaten in a simple fashion—that is, with the fingers.  They
picture to themselves the air filled with martial music, the march
through shady forests in the "old dominion" of Virginia, the
occasional halts amidst romantic scenery, the bath at some crystal
spring, with a silvery cascade leaping over moss-covered stones, and
invigorating the wearied frame of the campaigner with its refreshing
temperature.  In the cool of the evening, as they smoke their cigars
in suburban summer-houses, reading "Our Special's" letter, they pine
to be on tented plains.  As they puff the blue cloud from the fragrant
British havannah a mirage of a canvas city, transparent with light,
floats before their excited imaginations.  Passing the threshold of a
tent in their dreamy excursion to the realms of fancy, they behold a
merry group of men-at-arms jovially engaged in killing time instead of
the enemy, some lounging in rocking-chairs, others reclining at length
on the velvety sward, and all imbibing nectar in the shape of mint
juleps, brandy smashes, gin cocktails, port wine sangarees, and
whiskey punches.  Such, my friends, is the romance of campaigning;
read on, and you will see the reality.</p>

<p>My location at present is near a place called "Ball's Cross Roads,"
on the Virginia shore of the Potomac.  In the early hours of the
morning and in the evening moving about the neighbourhood is like
wading through a morass, so heavy falls the dew, while during the
other portion of the day the sun strikes with such intensity on the
camp that one scarcely dares quit shelter for fear of coup de soleil,
and to remain in the interior of your tent is to risk being parboiled.
At four a.m. the drum beats the réveille close to your head just as
you have done battling with myriads of bloodthirsty mosquitos and
other nameless  insects, and are getting into your first sleep.  At
five there is another roll for company drill; and, unless you want to
go without your breakfast, you must be up and dressed by six.
Dressing occupies but a short time, there being very little to take
off on going to bed, and, consequently, very little to put on on
rising.  Happy is he who does not find a juvenile rattlesnake in his
boot.  Apropos of snakes in boots, I had a curious incident related to
me the other day.  An officer who had been warned over night by some
of his comrades against such intrusions, and being advised to shake
his leathers well before donning them, treated the matter very
lightly, and thought it a useless precaution to take, as, in the first
place, he did not believe a snake would seek lodgings in his
wellingtons, and, in the second, he thought that a good stamp on any
foreign substance would settle the affair satisfactorily.  The next
morning frightful yells were heard issuing from the unbeliever's tent;
there were shrieks of "Murder!" coupled with implorings for the
doctor; and, on his neighbours rushing to his assistance, they found
him limping about with one boot on, which he begged with an agonizing
expression they would immediately cut off.  He screamed out there was
a snake in it, which had bitten him badly, and that the more he
crushed it the deeper it inserted his fangs, and he was sure he had
but a few moments to live.  The doctor soon made his appearance and
commenced ripping the boot from the leg, when, to the surprise of
every one, out dropped a spur covered with blood.  The patient's
nigger had the preceding evening unbuckled both these appendages, and
had thoughtlessly inserted one in each boot for safety.</p>

<p>The crystal spring alluded to in the fanciful sketch of campaigning
is, in my case, a yellow, sluggish stream, flowing lazily through a
deep, wooded dell (all the water in Virginia appears to me to be of
the colour and consistency of pea-soup, except here and there a
drinking-spring), and in this I take my bath, feeling infinitely more
dirty afterwards than I did before.  The first morning I performed my
ablutions in this main sewer of a clayey range of hills I disturbed by
my riotous immersion a considerable family of the amphibious
serpentine species (you see I am obligated to return to my snakes),
which wriggled off in every direction, leaving me, terrified,
mid-stream.  In my anxiety to escape I dragged myself up the bank
through a thicket of briars, and I still feel the smarts as I write
this.  Custom, however, hardens one to anything; and I and the snakes
now disport ourselves with mutual confidence in our mud bath.  By the
time the laving process is achieved breakfast claims one's attention,
and the savoury smells from Charley's kitchen lead you by the nose to
the mess-tent.  I declare that our sable maitre d'htel has improvised
us some prime rump-steak.  Crunch! how tough it is!  "Why, where on
earth did you get this, Charley?" "Get it, sar? Why, yer heerd last
night a sentry shoot a Secesh, after tattoo?"  Gracious goodness!
surely the Ethiopian don't intend to make cannibals of us!  "Well,
sar, it warn't a Secesh at all; it war the Secesh farmer's ole cow;
and, as this nigger discubbered her fust, weltering in her gauze, I
thought mebbe the genlemen ud like to hab a under cut.  Ugh! ugh! ugh!
Berry excellent meat, sar!"  Shades of the Old Cheshire Cheese! how I
pine after my accustomed "steak and mashed powtaturs, down together"!
Give me the Moore of Wine-office-court in place of the wretched Moor
that caters for me now.  After an unsatisfactory meal comes the hot,
dried-up day, throughout which you are wretchedly uncomfortable.
Flies and mosquitos fight their battles on each uncovered portion of
your skin; the perspiration oozes from every pore in your body.  You
try to do some work, and immediately you have a dozen visitors from
neighbouring tents, who fan and fume all round the place, distracted
themselves and distracting you.  An indifferent dinner at last comes
as a kind of break to your misery, and the whole closes with infinite
pipe-smoking, and any amount of bad whiskey for those who like it.
Such is our camp life, rooted to the same spot, with no change of
scene, the only incidents to enliven one being an occasional skirmish
with the enemy's pickets, all of which I have sent you sketches of.
As yet I have hardly dared absent myself for a day, as in front of
this position the great battle will be fought.</p>

<p>What cannot fail to interest your readers greatly will be an effort
on my part to explain the positions of the Confederate and Federal
forces as they are now relatively placed.  The extreme right of the
Secessionist army is at Norfolk, in Eastern Virginia.  Their centre
may be said to extend from Richmond to Manassas Gap, running
north-west, and their left rests on Winchester, in the western part of
the "Old Dominion;" and it is undoubtedly in this State that all the
important fighting will take place.  Beyond comes Kentucky, neutral,
splitting, as it were, the line of operations into two distinct
aggressive and defensive movements.  In Missouri the Confederates have
their left, in the neighbourhood of Carthage, and their right
threatening Cairo, on the extreme southern border of Illinois.
Opposed to their left is General Lyons, who menaces them in that
quarter, while General Prentiss, in command at Cairo, shows a good
front to their right attack.  But the greatest interest unquestionably
lies in Virginia, where the most considerable force on both sides is
brought into the field.  Generals Patterson and M'Lellan, after
certain successful movements on the Upper Potomac, are about to form a
junction in the neighbourhood of Winchester, and we may expect daily
to hear of them giving the Disunionists battle.  General M'Dowell, in
command at Alexandria, on the right bank of the Potomac, opposite to
Washington, threatens the Secessionist positions at Fairfax and
Manassas Gap; while General Butler, at Fortress Monroe, in the
Chesapeake Bay, is awaiting orders to march in the direction of
Norfolk (notwithstanding his reverse at Big Bethel) with a flanking
movement on Richmond.  If your readers will just glance at the map of
the United States they will be able readily to follow out my
description.  General Scott, the veteran of the Mexican  war, commands
in chief, and though his head is blanched with the snows of
seventy-five winters, and his frame enfeebled by the hardships of more
than half a century of service, yet his energy and intellect are as
unimpaired as when he gained his old victories.  General Mansfield
acts as his Lieutenant.</p>

<p>A few remarks in reference to the organisation of the Union Army
will not be thrown away here.  For a country like the United
States—recollect I am speaking of only the northern division—to place
150,000 men in the field armed and equipped in the short space of
little better than two months is indeed surprising.  When I say
150,000 men I mean those actually in line of battle; not including the
untold legions on their way to the seat of war and others drilling in
the various States to which they belong.  Your readers, to realise the
energy that has been displayed, must take into consideration the fact
that the standing army has scarcely ever exceeded 15,000; and that
almost every man now called upon to serve has been enrolled, clothed,
armed, and drilled in the period above mentioned.  I do not mean to
assert that this army goes to the field in as serviceable a condition
as a European one of similar proportions; for in the essential of
cavalry they are lamentably deficient.  But perfection is not to be
expected from a country that has never laid claim to be considered a
military Power, though I very much doubt if America won't proudly
assert her right to such distinction before the close of the
lamentable strife she is now engaged in.  To one fact I can bear
positive testimony, which is, that no other nation could bring into
array a more goodly show of sinew and muscle.  There are regiments
taken from among the hardy sons of Maine, Michigan, Vermont,
Wisconsin, New Hampshire, and Iowa, men who gain their bread by
following avocetions in which physical strength and endurance go for
more than mental capacity.  It is not by any means uncommon to see in
the ranks huge, brawny fellows, six feet three and four in height,
"boys" who can hand a tree or start a raft over a fall, throttle a
bear, or pole a barge down the rapids, and in whose hands a musket and
bayonet is no more than a toasting-fork.  Of course, every Northern
State gives its quota to the national forces, and I have simply
particularised the above for the sake of introducing some of the
athletae about to enter the arena.  The greatest failing probably in
this army is the want of competent officers.  The men themselves begin
to feel this, and are murmuring openly at the corruptive practices
which take wealthy tradesmen from behind their counters and dub them
Colonels and Majors-General.  Had it not been for this system of
political interestedness the mishaps at Big Bethel and Vienna would
never have occurred, and the term in reference to the conduct of a
commanding officer on one of these occasions, as to "losing his
presence of mind," would probably have been omitted in the reports of
the engagement.  Speaking of engagements, I would here like to put
myself right with you and your readers.  If you do not receive from me
sketches of every action fought, it is because I am unable to make
myself ubiquitous; and it must also be recollected that this is a "big
country," and that the distances between the different columns are
great, and the railroads partially destroyed.  I managed, however, to
pay a flying visit to Patterson's division at Martinsburg, getting up
in time to witness his gallant and successful dash at the Confederate
troops on the Upper Potomac, which occurred on the 2nd ult.  I send
you a Sketch of the advance of the Wisconsin men through the
wheat-fields, after fording the river, to attack the enemy's
position.</p>

<p>We are now daily waiting orders to advance, and when they come some
75,000 troops will be put in motion, advancing on the centre of the
Confederate position.  It is possible the first engagement will take
place at Fairfax, from which we are now distant about eight miles.
Should the Secessionist force, however, retire from that neighbourhood
a great battle cannot fail to be fought at Manassas Gap, twelve miles
further on, where their largest body of troops is assembled.  When we
move there will be an increase of subjects to sketch, and I shall be
able to keep you better supplied than I have hitherto done.</p>

Her Majesty, deeply lamenting this calamitous result, has determined,
in common with the other Powers of Europe, to preserve a strict

remarkable.  There has been an unhappy sameness in them, both as
regards subject and treatment, which has tended to their abbreviation,
and there was, as far as we recollect, not a single instance of a
foregn debate occupying a whole evening. . . . Whenever the state of
things in the United Staes of America has been touched on, it has been
with a praiseworthy reticence; and in this, as in all the rest of our

Engravings (from drawings made by Mr. Lefevre James Cranstone) in
connection with Richmond, the chief town of Virginia, where the
Southern Congress is now holding its sittings, and which for the time
being takes rank as the capital of the Confederate States of America.
Richmond is situated on the north bank of the James River, about 150
miles from its mouth.  Its chief public building is the State House,
or Capitol, which is finely situated in the middle of a lawn, on the
brow of a hill which overlooks the city.  It is a copy of the Maison
Carrée of Nîmes, the plan of which was sent over by Mr. Jefferson,
when he was Ambassador in France.  The Capitol is a principal feature
in the aspect of the city from many points of view.  Virginia is
justly proud of having given birth to Washington, and statues of him
are frequent in the State.  Besides the Washington Statue in the
Capitol at Richmond there is, in the beautiful park of which the city
boasts, an equestrian one of him (given on the preceding page), in
company with statues of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry—all of
which were chiselled in Europe at an immense cost.</p>

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the City of Washington at Queenstown we have
telegrams to the 27th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF BULL'S RUN.</p>

<p>After the check which the Federalists received on the 18th ult. in
the first assault on the Confederates' position to the south of Bull's
Run—a stream which in England would be called a river—General M'Dowell
contented himself for the two following days with reconnoitring the
position of the enemy.  Finding the position, which was very similar
to that occupied by the Russians at Alma, too strong for an attack in
front, his first idea was to get in the rear of the intrenchments.
The obstacles to the passage of artillery presented by the narrow and
stony roads rendered this plan impracticable. It was therefore
arranged that an attack should be made on the left flank of the enemy,
accompanied by a feint in front.  The day fixed for the general
engagement was Sunday, the 21 ult.  The Federal forces began their
march on this memorable day at half-past two a.m.  The first batteries
opened at five a.m.; but it was not until noon that the infantry
engagement commenced. At this time the Federal front extended over
about five miles.  In the hand-to-hand conflicts the Federals were
uniformly successful, and at length had carried all the works on the
crest of the hill but two or three.  Reinforcements kept continually
arriving to the Confederates from Manassas.  Suddenly, about four
o'clock p.m., an order was given to retreat, and this retreat soon
became a more than disorderly flight.  It appears that an attack of
the Confederate cavalry was made on the baggage and ammunition stores
of the Federalists, which were unprotected by cavalry pickets, as they
should have been.  The teamsters fled in the utmost confusion.  The
ambulance and artillery waggoners cut the horses loose and galloped
towards Washington.  The reserves, attacked in the rear, followed,
escaping over a bridge which the Confederate cavalry either dared not
or could not seize.  Colonel Blenker's regiment, the 8th New York (a
German corps), alone of the reserves remained firm.  When General
M'Dowell found his reserves had fled he gave that order to retreat
which so much surprised some of the Northern regiments.  The retreat
in the face of a pursuing enemy at once became a flight.
Nevertheless, the Federals did not suffer much, as they repulsed the
cavalry on the field of battle, and Colonel Blenker's regiment
protected the rear from Centreville.  The Southern account, by way of
New Orleans and Louisville, informs us that General Johnston (the
report of whose death is one of the many <hi rend="italic">canards</hi> to which this affair
has given rise) commanded the Confederate left, "where the enemy made
the fiercest attack."  General Beauregard commanded the right.
President Davis reached the field at noon, and took command of the
centre.  When the left was pressed the severest, the centre engaged a
portion of the enemy's forces, and, it is added, "decided the fortunes
of the day."</p>

<p rend="center">THE FLIGHT.</p>

<p>Everything was abandoned—guns, rifles, the wounded, blankets, knapsacks, 
ammunition, provisions, waggons-everything that could impede flight—were left 
behind.  General M'Dowell endeavoured to rally the fugitives at Centreville, 
and again at Fairfax Court Houes [sic], but in vain.  They only stopped at the 
Potomac, after a run of twenty-four miles.  Here a regiment on guard at the 
Long Bridge and the discontinuance of the steam-ferries stopped their further 
flight, or the army would have dissipated in as many hours as it took months to 
form.  Yet there was nobody in pursuit.  It was only at eleven p.m. that a small
 force of cavalry attacked Colonel Blenker's regiment, and were easily repulsed.
  This regiment retired from Centreville at about one a.m. on Monday morning, 
and marched back leisurely to its old encampment opposite Washington, being the 
only one which retired in a dignified manner.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LOSS.</p>

<p>The loss that the Federalists sustained is said to be "continually
decreasing."  At first represented at 10,000, it has rapidly fallen to
"from 300 to 500" in killed and wounded.  Many regiments were said to
be "cut to pieces" whose members had merely taken to the woods, and
who have since reappeared.  Among the killed is Colonel Cameron, of
the Highland Regiment, and brother of the Secretary of War.  The
Southern loss in probably greater than the Northern in killed and
wounded.  On Monday the Federal cavalry revisited the field of battle,
and brought off some of their derelict artillery.</p>

<p>[We give in the accompanying Supplement a more detailed account of
the battle and of the Federal army's flight.]</p>

<p rend="center">RECEPTION OF THE NEWS.</p>

<p>Congress, on the 22nd, passed resolutions that no disasters,
however overwhelming, would deter them from maintaining the Union.  In
the Senate a resolution confiscating the property (including slaves)
of persons who had taken up arms against the Union was passed by 32
yeas and 6 nays, after a spirited debate.</p>

<p>General M'Dowell was superseded by the Government, and General
M'Clellan appointed in his stead to the command of the Army of the
Potomac.  The Government has since accepted all the troops that have
offered, and show every disposition to continue the contest with
greater vigour than ever.</p>

<p>The news of the defeat of the Federalists was received by the
Baltimoreans with joy.  Pictures of General Beauregard were sold in
great numbers.  There was, however, no rioting.</p>

<p>New York passed through several alternations of feeling.  On Sunday
it was believed that a great victory had been won, and there was
exuberant public joy, and some talk of commencing a war with England.
On Monday, when very exaggerated reports of the Federal losses came
in, the joy was turned into consternation, wailing, and cries for
vengeance.  On Tuesday, when the small aggregate of the loss of life
became known, equanimity was restored.</p>

<p rend="center">FEDERAL SUCCESSES.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan, in an address to his "army of the West," boasts
that they have annihilated two armies, taken five guns, twelve
colours, 1500 stand of arms, and 1000 prisoners, including more than
forty officers.  One of the second commanders of the enemy is a
prisoner, the other was killed, more than 250 of the enemy have shared
his fate, together with all the baggage and camp equipage.  All this
had been accomplished with the loss of twenty killed and sixty wounded
on the part of the Union army in Western Virginia.</p>

<p>Two of the prizes captured by the Southern privateers have been
recaptured from the prize crew by the prisoners.  In the case of the
schooner Waring a free coloured man effected the recapture by killing
with his own hand all the prize crew save one, and putting that one in
irons.  He then took command, and brought her in safety to New York.
His motive was the assurance that he should be enslaved if taken into
Charleston.  He is a Rhode Islander, and has become quite a hero in
New York.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>

<p>It is said there are but three United States' vessels blockading
the entire coast of North Carolina, and that the port of Beaufort in
that State is, for the most time, perfectly free from blockade.</p>

<p>The <title>New York Times'</title>  correspondent at Fort Pickens states that
Admiral Milne has informed the British Government that the blockade is
totally inefficient.  This report evidently requires qualification, as
another reporter, for the <title>Tribune</title>, writes that the Admiral was
satisfied that the blockade of the Mississippi at least was
sufficiently effective.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
<p>Stocks fell after the disaster at Bull's Run, but exchange on England
has risen higher than for many months past.  Secretary Chase made
application for a 5,000,000-dollar loan in Treasury notes, but only
half the amount required was offered.</p>

<p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> news, long looked for, came at last." On 
Sunday London heard that on the preceding Sunday fortnight the soldiers of the 
South and North had met in decisive battle; and we learned that the
Secessionists had inflicted disastrous defeat upon the Federalists.
The details have since arrived; every one has mastered them; and it is
not needful to recapitulate the story of the ill-advised attack, of
scientific defence, of retaliatory onslaught, and of disgraceful
flight. The day was not done when miles upon miles of the road
between Bull's Run and Fairfax were covered with fugitives from the
apprehended vengeance of the South.  The flight did not end with the
end of possible danger. The terrified soldiers of the Union continued
to hurry onwards, and their rush was only checked at Washington.  Of
the amount of slaughter we know nothing with certainty, but an army
might have better afforded to lose half its members than to endure the
moral blow which has fallen. The Palmetto flag is for the time
triumphant. Fierce is the exultation of the South; deep the
humiliation of the North. Yet the disaster is perfectly explicable;
and it is much to know the causes of things. The Southern force was
well disciplined, and was led by men who have studied the art of war.
It was, in great measure, acting on the defensive, in a district
admirably suited for the purpose, and these natural advantages had
been largely improved.  The Northern force rushed upon battle without
due preparation, and it is to the blatant folly of the newspapers
acting upon the weakness of statesmen who fear the mob that this great
disaster is due.  Scott would not have fought until autumn, it is
understood; but the idiot shout "Go ahead!" drove him upon the guns of
the South, and the Union flag has gone down.  On the more disgraceful
part of the story it is painful to dwell.  A battle may be lost; every
battle must be lost as well as won; but panic and cowardly flight,
accompanied by acts of yet more cowardly ferocity, are features in few
of the battles of civilised war.  It is clear that such volunteers as
have yet been raised are not to be depended on for the steadiness
which is the greatest virtue of a soldier, one for which no courage,
no enthusiasm, is an equivalent.  General Scott has to reconstruct his
army and to make it fit for the field; and when we read of new
thousands being poured down as reinforcements, we cannot but ask in
what respect do these promise better than their predecessors?  What,
too, shall be said of the "soldiers" who, because the last day of
their term was up, quitted their fellow-countrymen under the thunder
of the guns of Beauregard?  The whole narrative is too full of
unpleasant features to induce an English writer to dwell upon it.  Nor
will we do more than advert to the savage braggadocio which, at the
moment of an earlier and temporary success, menaced England with the
seizure of Canada in return for her resolve of neutrality.  Had the
Union been less miserably beaten at Bull's Run we might have resented
such wanton and unjust insult; as it is, we are silent.  Let it be
understood, however, wherever English journals are read, that the
victory of the South places its cause in no better position in English
eyes, and that if we see any favourable sign in this opening
misfortune, it is that the South has given such evidence of its
strength that an American statesman who shall, when the Northern
laurels have been somewhat retrieved, suggest a compromise and peace,
will be able to advance the strongest of all arguments—the
impossibility of crushing the enemy.   There was a rumour that, the
Confederates were advancing, and that Harper's Ferry was to be the
next scene of strife.  Possibly, in abandoning a defensive position,
they may forfeit the results of their victory, and yet General
Beauregard does not appear to be a rash and headstrong leader.
Washington has been secured, and the energies of the aged Generals of
the North, nearly all of whom are very old men, are devoted to the
reconstruction of the army.</p>

<p rend="center">BATTLE OF BULL'S RUN.</p>

<p>The Federal army, under General M'Dowell, sustained a
disastrous defeat at Bull's Run on the 21st ult.  Bull's Run is a
stream which intersects the railway from Alexandria to Manassas, and
the road from Centreville south, running through a succession of
gorges and hills, between steep wooded banks—a kind of Alma, which the
Confederates have occupied strongly in advance of the main line of
their defences.  The most clear and detailed account of the battle
which we have received is contained in the Washington correspondence
of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> of the 23rd ult.  This is dated 
Washington, Monday morning, July 22, and is as follows:—</p>

<p>The attack was made in three columns, two of which, however, were
mainly feints, intended to amuse and occupy the enemy, while the
substantial work was done by the third.  It has been known for a long
time that the range of hills which border the small, swampy stream
known as Bull's Run had been very thoroughly and extensively fortified
by the rebels, that batteries had been planted at every available
point, usually concealed in woods and bushes which abound in that
vicinity, and covering every way of approach to the region beyond.
These are the advanced defences of Manassas Junction, which is some
three miles further off.  Until these were carried no approach could
be made to that place; and after they should be carried others of a
similar character would have to be overcome at every point where they
could be erected.  The utmost<pb n="144"/>

      </figure>
<pb n="145"/>
that military skill and ingenuity could accomplish for the defence of this point
was done.
General M'Dowell was unwilling to make an attack directly in face of
these batteries, as they would be doubtful issue, and must inevitably
result in a very serious loss of life.  After an attack had been
resolved upon, therefore, he endeavoured to find some way of <hi rend="italic">turning</hi>
the position.  His first intention was to do this on the southern
side—to throw a strong column into the place from that direction,
while a feigned attack should be made in front.  On Thursday, when the
troops were advanced to Centreville, it was found that the roads on
the south side of these positions was [sic] almost impracticable-that
they were narrow, crooked, and stony, and that it would be almost
impossible to bring up enough artillery to be effective in the time
required.  This original plan was, therefore, abandoned; and Friday
was devoted to an examination by the topographical engineers of the
northern side of the position.  Major Barnard and Captain Whipple
reconnoitred the place for miles around, and reported that the
position could be entered by a path coming from the north, although it
was somewhat long and circuitous.  This was selected, therefore, as
the mode and point of attack.</p>

<p>On Saturday the troops were all brought closely up to Centreville,
and all needful preparations were made for the attack which was
intended for the next day.  Yesterday morning, therefore, the army
marched—by two roads—Colonel Richardson with his command taking the
southern, which leads to Bull's Run, and General Taylor the
northern—running parallel to it at a distance of about a mile and a
half.  The movement commenced at about three o'clock.  I got up at a
little before four, and found the long line of troops extended far out
on either road.  I took the road by which Colonel Hunter with his
command, and General M'Dowell and Staff, had gone, and pushed on
directly for the front.  After going out about two miles Colonel
Hunter turned to the right, marching obliquely towards the Run, which
he was to cross some four miles higher up, and then come down upon the
intrenched positions of the enemy on the other side.  Colonel Miles
was left at Centerville and on the road, with reserves which he was to
bring up whenever they might be needed.  General Tyler went directly
forward, to engage the enemy in front, and send reinforcements to
Colonel Hunter whenever it should be seen that he was engaged.</p>

<p>I went out, as I have already stated, upon what is marked as the
northern road.  It is hilly, like all the surface of this section.
After going out about three miles you come to a point down which the
road, leading through a forest, descends; then it proceeds by a
succession of rising and falling knolls for a quarter of a mile, when
it crosses a stone bridge and then ascends by a steady slope to the
heights beyond.  At the top of that slope the rebels had planted heavy
batteries, and the woods below were filled with their troops and with
concealed cannon.  We proceeded down the road to the first of the
small knolls mentioned, when the whole column halted.  The 30-pounder
Parrott gun, which has a longer range than any other in the army, was
planted directly in the road. Captain Ayres' battery was stationed in
the woods a little to the right.  The 1st Ohio and 2nd New York
Regiments were thrown into the woods in advance on the left.  The 69th
New York and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Connecticut Regiments were ranged
behind them, and the 2nd Wisconsin was thrown into the woods on the
right.  At about half past six o'clock the 30-pounder threw two shells
directly into the battery at the summit of the slope, on the opposite
height, one of which, as I learned afterwards, struck and exploded
directly in the midst of the battery, and occasioned the utmost havoc
and confusion.  After about half an hour Captain Ayres threw ten or
fifteen shot and shell from his battery into the same place.  But both
failed to elicit any reply.  Men could be seen moving about the
opposite slope, but the batteries were silent.  An hour or so
afterwards we heard three or four heavy guns from Colonel Richardson's
column at Bull's Run, and these were continued at intervals for two or
three hours, but they were not answered even by a single gun.  It was
very clear that the enemy intended to take his own time for paying his
respects to us, and that he meant, moreover, to do it in his own way.
Meantime we could hear in the distance the sound of Colonel Hunter's
axemen clearing his way, and awaited with some impatience the sound of
his cannon on the opposite heights.  Time wore along with occasional
shots from our guns, as well as those of Colonel Richardson's column,
but without, in a single instance, receiving any reply.</p>

<p>At a little before eleven o'clock the 1st Ohio and 2nd New York,
which were lying in the wood on the left, were ordered to advance.
They did so—passing out of the road and climbing a fence into a wood
opposite, which they had barely approached, however, when they were
met by a tremendous discharge of a four-gun battery, planted at the
left in the woods, mainly for the purpose of sweeping the road
perpendicularly and the open field on its right, by which alone troops
could pass forward to the opposite bank.  They were staggered for a
moment, and received orders to retire.  Captain Ayres' battery
(formerly Sherman's) was advanced a little, so as to command this
battery, and by twenty minutes of vigorous play upon it silenced it
completely.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven we heard Hunter's guns on the opposite height,
over a mile to the right.  He was answered by batteries there, and
then followed the sharp, rattling, volleys of musketry, as their
infantry became engaged.   The firing was now incessant.  Hunter had
come upon them suddenly, and formed his line of  battle in an open
field, at the right of the road.  The enemy drew  up to oppose him,
but he speedily drove them to retreat, and followed them up with the
greatest vigour and rapidity.  Meantime, for some three hours
previous, we had seen long lines of dense dust rising from the roads
leaving from Manassas, and, with the glass, we could very clearly
perceive that they were raised by the constant and steady stream of
reinforcements, which continued to pour in nearly the whole day.   The
69th, 79th, 2nd and 8th New York—the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Connecticut,
and the 2nd Wisconsin—were brought forward in advance of the wood and
marched across the field to the right, to go to Colonel Hunter's
support.  They crossed the intervening stream and drew up in a small
open field, separated from Colonel Hunter's column by a dense wood,
which was filled with batteries and infantry.  Our guns continued to
play upon the woods which thus concealed the enemy, and aided
materially in clearing them for the advance.  [Only by] going down to
the extreme front of the column, could I watch the progress of Colonel
Hunter, marked by the constant roar of artillery and the roll of
musketry, as he pushed the rebels back from point to point.  At one
o'clock he had driven them out of the woods and across the road which
was the prolongation of that on which we stood.  Here, by the side of
their batteries, the rebels made a stand.  They planted their flag
directly in the road, and twice charged across it upon our men, but
without moving them an inch.  They were met by a destructive fire, and
were compelled to fall still further back.  Gradually the point of
fire passed further away, until the dense  clouds of smoke which
marked the progress of the combat were at least half a mile to the
left of what had been  the central position of the rebels.</p>

<p>It was now half-past two o'clock.  I was at the advanced point of
the front of our column, some hundred rods beyond the woods, in which
the few troops then there were drawn up, when I decided to drive back
to the town, for the purpose of sending you my despatch.  As I passed
up the road the balls and shells from the enemy began to fall with
more than usual rapidity.  I did not see the point from which they
came; but, meeting Captain Ayres, he said he was about to bring up his
battery, supported by the Ohio Brigade, under General Schenck, to
repel a rumoured attempt of cavalry to outflank this column.  As I
went forward he passed down.  General Schenck's brigade was at once
drawn up across the road, and Captain Ayres' guns were planted in a
knoll at the left, when a powerful body of rebels, with a heavy
battery, came down from the direction of Bull's Run, and engaged this
force with tremendous effect.  I went to Centreville, sent off my
despatch, and started with all speed to return—intending to go with
our troops upon what had been the hotly-contested field, never
doubting for a moment that it would remain in their hands.  I had gone
but a quarter of a mile when we met a great number of fugitives, and
our carriage soon became entangled in a mass of baggage-waggons, the
officer in charge of which told me it was useless to go in that
direction, as our troops were retreating.  Not crediting the story,
which was utterly inconsistent with what I had seen but a little while
before, I continued to push on.  I soon met Quartermaster Stetson, of
the Fire Zouaves, who told me, bursting into tears, that his regiment
had been utterly cut to pieces, that the Colonel and
Lieutenant-Colonel were both killed, and that our troops had actually
been repulsed.  I still tried to proceed, but the advancing columns
rendered it impossible, and I turned about.  Leaving my carriage, I
went to a high point of ground and saw, by the dense cloud of dust
which rose over each of the three roads by which the three columns of
the army had advanced, that they were all on the retreat.  Sharp
discharges of cannon in their rear indicated that they were being
pursued.  I waited half an hour or so to observe the troops and
batteries as they arrived, and then started for Washington to send my
despatch and write this letter.  As I came past the hill on which the
Secessionists had their intrenchments less than a week ago I saw our
forces taking up positions for a defence if they should be
assailed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE RETREAT.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Tuesday contains an account of the retreat
of the Federal forces from Bull's Run by its Special Correspondent.
Mr. Russell started, with another English gentleman, for the scene of
action early on Sunday morning, the 21st of July, in a small carriage,
with a led horse behind to provide for emergencies.  Having got to a
hill which commanded a partial view of the battle-field they were
giving their horses a brief rest before pushing on to the front.  Here
they were joined by the Special Artist of this Journal.  The remainder
of the narrative, as far as we can afford space for it, we give in
Mr. Russell's own words:—</p>

<p><q>In the midst of our little reconnaissance Mr. Vizetelly, who has been
living and, indeed, marching with one of the regiments as artist of
the <hi rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London 
News</hi>, came up and told us the action had been
commenced in splendid style by the Federalists, who had advanced
steadily, driving the Confederates before them—a part of them, as I
firmly believe, to bring them under the range of their guns.  He
believed the advantages on the Federalist side were decided, though
won with hard fighting, and he had just come up to Centreville to look
after something to eat and drink, and to procure little necessaries,
in case of need, for his comrades.  His walk, very probably, saved his
life.  Having seen all that could be discerned through our glasses, my
friend and myself had made a feast on our sandwiches in the shade of
the buggy; my horse was eating and resting, and I was forced to give
him half an hour or more before I mounted, and meantime tried to make
out the plan of battle, but all was obscure and dark.  Suddenly up
rode an officer, with a crowd of soldiers after him, from the village.
"We've whipped them on all points!" he shouted, "We've taken their
batteries, and they're all retreating!"  Such an uproar as followed.
The spectators and the men cheered again and again, amid cries of
"Bravo!"  "Bully for us!"  "Didn't I tell you so?" and guttural
"hochs" from the Deutschland folk and loud "hurroos" from the Irish.
Soon afterwards my horse was brought up to the hill, and my friend and
the gentlemen I have already mentioned set out to walk towards the
front—the latter to rejoin his regiment if possible, the former to get
a closer view of the proceedings.  As I turned down into the narrow
road or lane, already mentioned, there was a forward movement among
the four-wheeled tilt-waggons, which raised a good deal of dust.  My
attention was particularly called to this by the occurrence of a few
minutes afterwards.  I had met my friends on the road, and after a few
words rode forward at a long trot as well as I could past the waggons
and through the dust, when suddenly there arose a tumult in front of
me at a small bridge across the road, and then I perceived the drivers
of a set of waggons with the horses turned towards me, who were
endeavouring to force their way against the stream of vehicles setting
in the other direction.  By the side of the new set of waggons there
were a number of commissariat men and soldiers, whom at first sight I
took to be the baggage guard.  They looked excited and alarmed, and
were running by the side of the horses—in front the dust quite
obscured the view.  At the bridge the currents met in wild disorder.
"Turn back!  Retreat!" shouted the men from the front.  "We're
whipped, we're whipped!"  They cursed and tugged at the horses' heads,
and struggled with frenzy to get past.  Running by me on foot was a
man with the shoulder-straps of an officer.  "Pray what is the matter,
Sir?"  "It means we're pretty badly whipped, and that's a fact," he
blurted out in puffs, and continued his career.  I observed that he
carried no sword.  The teamsters of the advancing waggons now caught
up the cry.  "Turn back-turn your horses!" was the shout up the whole
line, and, backing, plunging, rearing, and kicking, the horses which
had been proceeding down the road reversed front and went off towards
Centreville.  Those behind them went madly rushing on, the drivers
being quite indifferent whether glory or disgrace led the way,
provided they could find it.  In the midst of this extraordinary
spectacle an officer, escorted by some dragoons, rode through the ruck
with a light cart in charge.  Another officer on foot, with his sword
under his arm, ran up against me.  "What is all this about?"  "Why,
we're pretty badly whipped!  We're all in retreat!  There's General
Tyler there badly wounded!"  And on he ran.  There came yet another,
who said, "We're beaten on all points!  The whole army is in retreat!"
Still there was no flight of troops, no retreat of an army, no reason
for all this precipitation.  True, there were many men in uniform
flying towards the rear, but it did not appear as if they were beyond
the proportions of a large baggage escort.  I got my horse up into the
field out of the road, and went on rapidly towards the front.  Soon I
met soldiers who were coming through the corn, mostly without arms;
and presently I saw firelocks, cooking-tins, knapsacks, and
great-coats on the ground, and observed that the confusion and speed
of the baggage-carts became greater, and that many of them were
crowded with men, or were followed by others who clung to them.  The
ambulances were crowded with soldiers, but it did not look as if there
were many wounded.  Negro servants on led horses dashed frantically
past; men in uniform whom it were a disgrace to the profession of arms
to call "soldiers" swarmed by on mules, chargers, and even draught
horses, which had been cut out of carts or waggons, and went on with
harness clinging to their heels, as frightened as their riders.  Men
literally screamed with rage and fright when their way was blocked up.
On I rode, asking all "What is all this about?" and now and then, but
rarely, receiving the answer, "We're whipped!" or "We're repulsed!"
Faces black and dusty, tongues out in the heat, eyes staring-it was a
most wonderful sight. . . The road was now literally covered with
baggage.  It seemed to me as if the men inside were throwing the
things our purposely.  "Stop!" cried I to the driver of one of the
carts, "everything is falling out."  "— you!" shouted a fellow inside,
<pb n="145"/> "if you stop him I'll blow your
brains out."  My attempts to save Uncle Sam's property were then and
there discontinued. . . . What occurred at the hill I cannot say, but
all the road from Centreville for miles presented such a sight as can
only be witnessed in the track of the runaways of an utterly
demoralised army.  Drivers flogged, lashed, spurred, and beat their
horses, or leaped down and abandoned their teams, and ran by the side
of the road; mounted men, servants, and men in uniform, vehicles of
all sorts, commissariat-waggons thronged the narrow ways.  At every
shot a convulsion, as it were, seized upon the morbid mass of bone,
sinew, wood, and iron, and thrilled through it, giving new energy and
action to its desperate efforts to get free from itself.  Again the
cry of "Cavalry!" arose.  "What are you afraid of?" said I to a man
who was running beside me.  "I'm not afraid of you," replied the
ruffian, levelling his piece at me and pulling the trigger.  It was
not loaded or the cap was not on, for the gun did not go off.  I was
unarmed, and I did go off as fast as I could, resolved to keep my own
counsel for the second time that day.  And so the flight went on.  At
one time a whole mass of infantry, with fixed bayonets, ran down the
bank of the road, and some, falling as they ran, must have killed and
wounded those among whom they fell.  As I knew the road would soon
become impassable or blocked up, I put my horse to a gallop and passed
on towards the front.  But mounted men still rode faster, shouting
out, "Cavalry are coming!"  Again I ventured to speak to some officers
whom I overtook, and said, "If these runaways are not stopped the
whole of the posts and pickets into Washington will fly also!"  One of
them, without saying a word, spurred his horse and dashed on in front.
I do not know whether he ordered the movement or not, but the van of
the fugitives was now suddenly checked, and, pressing on through the
wood at the roadside, I saw a regiment of infantry blocking up the
way, with their front towards Centreville.  A musket was levelled at
my head as I pushed to the front:—"Stop, or I'll fire!"  At the same
time the officers were shouting out, "Don't let a soul pass!"  I
addressed one of them, and said, "Sir, I am a British subject.  I am
not, I assure you, running away.  I have done my best to stop this
disgraceful rout (as I had), and have been telling them there are no
cavalry within miles of them."  "I can't let you pass, Sir!"  I
bethought me of General Scott's pass.  The Adjutant read it, and the
word was given along the line,  "Let that man pass!" and so I rode
through, uncertain if I could now gain the Long-bridge in time to pass
over without the counters gn [sic].  It was about this time I met a
cart by the roadside surrounded by a group of soldiers, some of whom
had "69" on their caps.  The owner, as I took him to be, was in great
distress, and cried out as I passed, "Can you tell me, Sir, where the
69th are?  These men say they are cut to pieces."  "I can't tell you."
"I'm in charge of the mails, Sir, and I will deliver them if I die for
it.  You are a gentleman, and I can depend on your word.  Is it safe
for me to go on?"  Not knowing the extent of the <hi rend="italic">débâcle</hi>, I
assured him it was, and asked the men of the regiment how they
happened to be there?  "Shure, the Colonel himself told us to go off
every man on his own hook, and to fly for our lives," replied one of
them. . . . After sunset the moon rose, and amid other acquaintances I
jogged alongside an officer who was in charge of Colonel Hunter, the
commander of a brigade, I believe, who was shot through the neck, and
was inside a cart, escorted by a few troopers.  This officer was, as I
understood, the Major, or second in command of Colonel Hunter's
regiment, yet he had considered it right to take charge of his chief,
and leave his battalion.  He said they had driven back the enemy with
ease, but had not been supported, and blamed—as bad officers and good
ones will do—the conduct of the General: "So mean a fight I never
saw." . . . As I approached Washington, having left the Colonel and
his escort at some seven miles on the south side of the Long-bridge, I
found the grand guards, pickets' posts, and individual sentries
burning for news, and the word used to pass along "What does that man
say, Jack?"  "Begorra, he tells me we're not het at all—only
retraiting to the ould lines for convaniency of fighting to-morrow
again.  Oh, that's illigant!"  On getting to the téte du pont,
however, the countersign was demanded.  Of course I had not got it.
But the officer passed me through on the production of General Scott's
safeguard.  The lights of the city were in sight, and reflected on the
waters of the Potomac, just glistened by the clouded moon, shone the
gay lamps of the White House, where the President was probably
entertaining some friends.  In silence I passed over the Long-bridge.
Some few hours later it quivered under the steps of a rabble of
unarmed men.  At the Washington end a regiment with piled arms were
waiting to cross over into Virginia, singing and cheering.  Before the
morning they received orders, I believe, to assist in keeping Maryland
quiet.  For the hundredth time I repeated the cautious account, which
to the best of my knowledge was true.  There were men, women, and
soldiers to hear it.  The clocks had just struck eleven p.m. as I
passed Willard's.  The pavement in front of the hall was crowded.  The
rumours of defeat had come in, but few of the many who had been fed
upon lies and the reports of complete victory which prevailed could
credit the intelligence.  Seven hours had not elapsed before the
streets told the story.  The "Grand Army of the North," as it was
called, had representatives in every thoroughfare, without arms,
orders, or officers, standing out in the drenching rain.  When all
these most unaccountable phenomena were occurring I was fast asleep;
but I could scarce credit my informant in the morning, when he told me
that the Federalists, utterly routed, had fallen back upon Arlington
to defend the capital, leaving nearly five batteries of artillery,
8000 mu[s]kets, immense quantity of stores and baggage, and their
wounded and prisoners in the hands of the enemy!  Let the American
journals tell the story their own way.  I have told mine as I know
it. . . . There is much talk now (of "masked batteries," of course) of
outflanking, and cavalry, and such matters.  The truth seems to be
that the men were overworked, kept out for twelve or fourteen hours in
the sun exposed to long-range fire, badly officered, and of deficient
regimental organisation.  Then came a most difficult operation—to
withdraw this army, so constituted, out of action in face of an
energetic enemy who had repulsed it.  The retirement of the baggage,
which was without adequate guards, and was in the hands of ignorant
drivers, was misunderstood and created alarm, and that alarm became a
panic, which became frantic on the appearance of the enemy, and on the
opening of their guns on the runaways. . . .  Let me, however, express
an opinion as to the affair of yesterday.  In the first place, the
repulse of the Federalists, decided as it was, might have had no
serious effects whatever beyond the mere failure—which politically was
of greater consequence than it was in a military sense—but for the
disgraceful conduct of the troops.  The retreat on their lines at
Centreville seems to have ended in a cowardly rout—a miserable,
causeless panic.  Such scandalous behavior of the part of soldiers I
should have considered impossible, as, with some experience of camps
and armies, I have never even in alarms among camp-followers seen the
like of it.  How far the disorganisation of the troops extended I know
not; but it was complete in the instance of more than one regiment.
Washington this morning (the 22nd) is crowded with solders without
officers, who have fled from Centreville, and with "three months'
men," who are going home from the face of the enemy on the expiration
of their term of enlistment.</q></p>


<p rend="center">ESTIMATED STRENGTH OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN
ARMIES.</p>

<p>In another letter by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> Special Correspondent, 
written on the 19th ult., he estimates the effective strength of General
M'Dowell's army at 30,000 infantry, with about sixty field guns, and
ten squadrons of cavalry.  He reckons General M'Clellan's corps in
Western Virginia at 35,000 men, and General Patterson's division at
22,000.  The reserve at Washington he estimates at 16,000 men, the
troops in Maryland at 7400 men, and the corps lying at Fortress Monroe
and Hampton at 11,000.  The Southern army under General Beauregard at
Manassas Junction was, he says, estimated at 60,000 men; "but that
number must include the reserves, and a portion of the force in the
intrenchments along the road to Richmond, in the immediate
neighbourhood of which there is a corps of 15,000 men."  The rest of
the Southern army he reckons at 18,000 or 20,000 men at Norfolk, and
8000 to 9000 at Aquia Creek, besides General Johnson's corps of some
10,000 men.</p>

<p>The interest which at the beginning of the civil war in America
centred chiefly in Washington has latterly shifted from the capital on
account of the onward march of the Federal troops.  But the battle at
Bull's Run, so disastrous to their arms, and the flight consequent
thereon, make it a question whether Washington itself will not have to
stand the brunt of an attack from the Secessionist troops, flushed by
their late victory.  Our map, therefore, of the District of Columbia,
given on the preceding page, cannot fail to be of interest at the
present juncture.  The western and south-eastern boundaries of
Washington are formed by the main and eastern branches of the River
Potomac.  It is situated upon a plain, rising into gentle eminences
here and there, and fringed by a distant range of hills.  The streets
point directly to the four quarters of the compass, and are diagonally
intersected by spacious avenues, which converge from every direction
upon Capitol hill as a focus.  The northern and western boundary of
the city is an undulating plain, upon the verge of which the blue
hills of Montgomery county, Maryland, are distinctly visible.  Toward
the north-east the topographical features present nothing of more
efficient aid to defensive operations than a succession of slopes and
undulations.  At the western verge of the city the ground rises almost
abruptly, affording an excellent site for a battery, whose guns or
mortars could sweep half the horizon.  Upon the spit of land jutting
into the main branch of the Potomac stands the half-finished
Washington monument.  Around it is a span of many acres, commanding
the western bank of the river, the bridge of the Washington and
Alexandria Railroad, the only approach to the city from that
direction.  Along the south-west boundary of the city lie three
commanding elevations, which, occupied with men and artillery, would
render the approach of a storming force from any point of the compass
a matter of great difficulty.  All that part of the town having a land
boundary is inclosed by similar elevations, rendering it quite
possible to surround the city with batteries, advantageously planted,
commanding the entire plain.  The northern boundary of the city is the
one from which assault is most to be apprehended.  The rivers which
protect it on the west and south-west form an impregnable barrier,
and, guarded as they are, a land attack from either of those
directions need not be feared.  Seven miles above the city, at a place
called Little Falls, the fordage of the Potomac is regarded as
practicable, unless the east bank is well protected.  The approach to
the city in that direction would bring a storming force within range
of a row of batteries commanding the northern limit of the city.  The
openness of the surrounding plain leaves such a storming party but
little chance of effective strategic operations.  The assailants would
encounter first the fires of the batteries, and next a hand-to-hand
conflict with the forces behind them.</p>

<p>Respecting the apprehended danger of the capital the <hi rend="italic">New 
York Herald</hi> of the 23rd says:—</p>

<p><q>The danger which now menaces Washington is positive and formidable,
and all the troops from all quarters that can be spared for the
capital of our country should be sent forward at once.  The army, too,
should instantly be supplied with educated officers to the fullest
possible extent, and Mr. Lincoln should lose no time in strengthening
the weak places of his Cabinet.  We had hoped that this war would be
finished in a short triumphal Union campaign.  We were mistaken.  But
we have been misled by the misplaced confidence of our Government in
the strength of its army, and by the fatal delusion of the army itself
in regard to the retreating stratagems of the enemy.  The war now
ceases to be an uninterrupted onward march of our forces southward.
The Government, in a single day, and at the capital of the nation, is
thrown upon the defensive, and under circumstances demanding the most
prompt and generous efforts to strengthen our forces at that point.
Every other question, all other issues, and all other business, among
all parties and all classes of our loyal people, should be now made
subordinate to the paramount object of securing Washington.  The loyal
States within three days may dispatch 20,000 men to that point; and if
we hold the capital for twenty days we may have by that time an army
of 200,000 men intrenched around it.  Action, action, action!  Let our
Governor and State and city authorities, and the State and city
authorities of every loyal State, come at once to the rescua [sic],
and move forward their reinforcement, without waiting for instructions
from Washington.</q></p>

<p rend="center">SKIRMISH BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND THE SECESSIONIST TROOPS

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist in America, writing from the

the 7th ult., says he managed to pay a flying visit to Patterson's
division at Martinsburg, getting up in time to witness his gallant and
successful dash at the Confederate troops, on the 2nd ult., at
Hainsville on the Upper Potomac.  In reference to this brisk encounter
he has forwarded a Sketch (engraved on page 143) showing the advance
of the Wisconsin men through the wheatfields, after fording the river,
to attack the enemy's position.  Their behaviour (he says),
considering it was the first time they were under fire, was admirable;
they went on very steadily, poured in two or three volleys, and then,
making a rush with bowie-knife and revolver, sent the Disunionists
flying towards Winchester, leaving behind them many dead, wounded, and
prisoners.  The building burning in the distance is a barn in which a
strong body of the enemy had intrenched themselves, and near which
they had planted some guns.  A few shells sent into it by the Federal
artillery soon dislodged them, and completed the discomfiture of their
already wavering troops.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Confederate Congress has assembled at Richmond,
 and a telegram from that place, received in the Northern States viâ New 
Orleans, gives the following summary of President Davis's Message:—</p>

<p>Mr. Davis states that his Inaugural called attention to the causes
which formed the Confederacy, and that it is now only necessary to
call attention to such facts as have occurred during the recess, and
to matters connected with the public defence.  He congratulates
Congress on the accession to the Confederacy of other equal Sovereign
States.  It was deemed advisable to remove the archives of the several
departments to Richmond, to which place Congress had already removed
the seat of Government.</p>

<p>The aggressive movements of the enemy have induced prompt and
energetic action.  The accumulation of the enemy's forces on the
Potomac has sufficiently demonstrated that his efforts are directed
against Virginia, and from no point could the necessary measures for
her protection be so efficiently directed as from our capital.  The
rapid progress of the last few months has stripped the veil behind
which the true policy and purposes of Mr. Lincoln's Government had
been previously concealed, and they were now fully revealed.</p>

<p>The Message of their President, the action of their Congress during
its present Session, confess the intention  of subjugating the seceded
States by war, a folly which is only equalled by its wickedness—a war
by which it is impossible to attain the proposed result.  Whilst its
dire calamities cannot be avoided by us, they will fall with redoubled
severity on themselves.</p>

<p>Commencing in March last with an affectation of ignorance of the
secession of the seven States which organised the Confederate
Government, persisting in April in absurd assumptions of the existence
of a riot which was to be dispersed by <hi rend="italic">posse comitatus</hi>, continuing in
successive months false representations that the States intended
offensive war in spite of conclusive evidence to the contrary,
furnished as well by official action as by the basis of the
Constitution, the President of the United States succeeded in deluding
the people of those States into the belief that the purpose of this
Government was not peace at home, but conquest abroad; not the defence
of their liberties, but the subjugation of the people of the United
States.</p>

<p>The series of manoeuvres by which the impression was created, the
acts by which they were devised, and the perfidy by which they were
executed, are already known.  Could it be supposed they would make
openly their success a subject of boast and self-laudation in the
Executive Message?</p>

<p>Fortunately for truth, Mr. Lincoln's Message minutely details the
attempt to reinforce Fort Sumter in violation of the armistice of
which he confesses to have been informed only by rumour too vague and
uncertain to create any attention.  Hostile attempts to supply Fort
Sumter are admitted to have been undertaken with a knowledge that
their success was impossible.  The sending a notice to the Governor of
South Carolina of the intended ruse for the accomplishment of this
object, and quoting from the Inaugural that there would be no conflict
unless these States were the aggressors, and proceeding to declare
that his conduct, as in the past will be for the future, was in the
performance of this promise, which could not be misunderstood.  In
defiance of our statement that he gave notice of the approach of a
hostile fleet, he charges these States with being the assailants of
the Union.  The world cannot misunderstand this unfounded
pretence.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln expresses concern that some foreign nations have so
shaped their action as if they supposed the early destruction of the
Union probable.  He abandons further disguise, and proposes to make
the contest short and decisive, and confesses that even an increased
force is demanded.  These enormous preparations are a distinct avowal
that the United States are engaged in a conflict with a great and
powerful nation, and are compelled to abandon the pretence of
dispersing rioters and suppressing insurrection, and are driven to the
acknowledgment that the Union is dissolved.  They recognise the
separate existence of the Confederate States by indirection, by
embargo, and blockade, by which all communication between the two is
cut off.  They repudiate the foolish idea that the inhabitants of the
Confederacy are still citizens of the United States, for they are now
waging an indiscriminate war upon them with a savage ferocity unknown
to modern civilisation.  Mr. Davis then compares the present invasion
to that of Great Britain in 1781, but which was conducted in a more
civilised manner.  Mankind will shudder at the outrages committed on
defenceless females by those pretending to be our fellow-citizens.
Who will depict the horror with which they will regard the deliberate
malignity which, under pretext of suppressing an insurrection, makes
special war upon sick women and children by carefully-devised measures
to prevent their obtaining medicines necessary to their cure?  The
sacred claims of humanity, respected by all nations, even in the fury
of battle, by careful deviation of attack from hospitals, are now
outraged by the Government which pretends a desire to continue a
fraternal connection.  Such outrages admit of no retaliation unless
the actual perpetrators are required.  Taylor's mission to Washington
was to propose an exchange  of prisoners taken on the privateer
Savannah, and to inform Mr. Lincoln that we are determined to check
all barbarities on prisoners of war by such retaliation as will
effectually put an end to such practices.  Mr. Lincoln's promised
reply has not yet been received.  Reference is made to the peculiar
position existing between the Confederate Government and the States,
usually termed Border Slave States, which, the Message says, cannot be
properly withheld from notice.  Our people are animated by the
sentiments towards the inhabitants of those States which found
expression in your enactment refusing to consider them enemies or to
authorise hostilities against them.  That a large portion of those
States regard us as brethern, and, if unrestrained by the actual
presence of large armies, the subversion of the civil authority and
declaration of martial law, would, some of them at least, joyfully
unite with us.  But that they are with almost entire unanimity opposed
to the prosecution of the war waged against us is a fact of which
daily-recurring events warrant the assertion.  The President of the
United States, in refusing to recognise the right of those of our late
sister States refraining from an attack upon us, justifies his refusal
by the assertion that the States have no other power than that
reserved to them in the Union by the Constitution.  This new
constitutional relation between the States and the general Government
is a fitting introduction to another assertion of the Message—that the
Executive possesses the power of suspending the writ of habeas corpus
and of delegating that power to military commanders at discretion.
Both these propositions claim respect equal to that which is felt for an
additional statement of opinion in the same paper, that it is proper,
in order to execute the laws, that the single law made to meet the
extreme tenderness of citizens for liberty, that practically it
relieves more of the guilty than of the innocent, should to a very
limited extent be violated.  We may well rejoice that we have for ever
severed our connection with a Government that thus tramples upon all
principles of constitutional liberty, and with a people in whose
presence such avowals could be paraded.</p>

<p>  Our operations in the field were greatly extended by reason of
this policy, which, heretofore secretly entertained, is now avowed and
acted upon by the United States.  The forces hitherto raised have
proved ample for the defence of the States which originally organised
the Confederacy.  With the exception of these fortified islands, whose
defence is effectively aided by a preponderation of naval force, the
enemy has been driven—completely driven—out of those States.  These
forces must, however, necessarily prove inadequate on account of the
invasion by half a million of men now proposed by the enemy-and a
corresponding increase of our forces now becomes necessary.</p>

<p>The Message refers to the crops, which are the most abundant in our
history.  Many believe the supply adequate to two years' consumption.
Our citizens manifest a laudable pride in upholding their independence
unaided by any resources other than their own; and the subscript ons
[sic] to the loan proposed by the Government cannot fall short of
fifty million dollars, and will probably largely exceed that sum.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Americans of the North have taken their utter 
rout in very good part.  The panic which struck the "army of the Potomac" has 
been met by a corresponding display of fortitude on the part of the community
at large.  Congress and the Administration have acted in a truly Roman
spirit.  The Cannae of Virginia has not caused them to despair of the
Republic.  Renewed vigour has been the only order of the day at
Washington.  Northern journalists, to their credit be it said, have
not sought to extenuate nor disguise the disgraceful facts which
accompanied the flight of the army in which they took so much pride.
Exposures worse than those of Mr. Russell are freely published in the
journals of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia.  The first thought has
been, not "What will England and France say?" but "What are the causes
of this great disaster, and how shall we act so as to do better next
time?"  Consciously or unconsciously, they have emulated the spirit of
English journalists during the disasters of the first Crimean winter.
National vanity has given way before loftier considerations, and, just
as the unsparing confessions and criticisms of our newspapers paved
the way for reform and reorganisation in every branch of the service,
so the application of the same remedial agency in the United States,
when backed up by the unsubdued confidence of the people, augurs well
for the recovery of their military prestige.  Sooth to say, we like
the Northerners better under this aspect than in that late hectoring
mood when they boasted that the Southern armies would all be driven
into Texas by January next, after which Mr. Davis and all his Cabinet,
and Beauregard and his Generals, were to be hanged; while we English
were specially selected as the objects of the undying vengeance of the
victors, because, in common with the rest of Europe, we recognised the
Confederates as a belligerent power, and because, in common also with
the general current of European public opinion, and in perfect good
faith and the most friendly spirit, we ventured to argue that
peaceable separation was a better solution of the problem for all
parties than a civil war on the largest scale, of the fiercest
character and the most doubtful results. The first frost of adversity
has withered this vainglorious spirit. The North recognises in the
South a foe formidable on her own soil; and

the anti-British rabies is so extinct among them that the tender of a
regiment of British volunteers which was made to the authorities of
the State of New York in April, and superciliously rejected, has been
graciously accepted by the Federal Government in July.  The spoiled
children of fortune need a little adversity to bring out the finer
points of their character.  The dazzling sun of a marvellous
prosperity had shed its influences upon them so long that they scarce
knew themselves, and dreamt the world was at their feet.  Now that
that era has passed away, and a destructive tornado is scattering to
the four quarters of heaven the accumulated fruits of a long peace,
the men seem more heroic than before.  The Southerners share equally
with the Northerners in this apparent increase of stature.
Sacrificing without a sigh every luxury and many of the necessaries of
life—as poorly equipped and cared for in many respects as the French
patriot armies of 1792—they rob us of our sympathies much more now
when fighting on the heights of Manassas for their national
independence, as the French fought in the same cause on the heights of
Valmy, than when their chiefs were dominant at Washington,
brow-beating and challenging every anti-slavery representative, when
enthusiastic mass meetings were presenting gold-headed canes to the
ruffian assailants of Charles Sumner, Horace Greeley, John Hickman,
and other non-duelling, anti-slavery champions, and when Palmetto
volunteers rushed to the field, not, as now, against foemen worthy of
their steel, but to burn down the towns, villages, and homesteads of
the peaceful Free-State settlers in Kansas.  The Southern chivalry
have nobler game before them now than the tarring and feathering of
defenceless individual Northerners in their midst; and the fiery
ordeal they have chosen for themselves cannot fail to give a grandeur
to their attitude which will command more respect from the onlooking
world than was ceded to them when they occupied the pride of place in
the Government of that Great Republic which need not be less truly
great because they have left it.</p>

<p>The North has at length got over one absurd and dangerous illusion
to which she had hitherto clung with a strange obstinacy—that is, that
"in every State, except, perhaps, South Carolina," there was a
majority in favour of the Union, and that all the Secessionist
movements were the result of a plot on the part of a few disappointed
politicians and intriguing theorists, in which the mass of the people
took no part.  The truth is, that except in Western Virginia and in
Eastern Tennessee, where the Stars and Stripes are still flying, the
Unionist party has no existence whatever in the seceded States.  No
one in Europe has ever shared in this illusion.  It has been evident
to us all along that the South was, with the above-named exceptions,
terribly unanimous and terribly in earnest.  But the North have fallen
into that common human failing of believing things to be as they would
desire to have them, and the consequence has been that they have had
to suffer a rude awakening.  The battle of Bull Run enabled them to
gauge the depth of Southern fanaticism in behalf of independence by
the side of their own love of empire.  The Northern troops found
themselves opposed to a regiment of coloured men who fought with no
want of zeal against them.  Louisiana has called her free negroes to
arms, and North Carolina has not disdained to enroll among her
contingent her stalwart Cherokees.  But the North, partly through
prejudice of colour, and partly through a fraternal feeling towards
the Southerners, will allow no coloured men to serve under the Stars
and Stripes.  The North stupidly prefers to enlist Caucasian
three-months' men, who coolly walk off the field of battle on the day
of the engagement because their time was up that day!  Now, when one
side conquers its prejudices and employs all possible weapons, while
the other hampers itself with restrictions, and fights with a sort of
reluctance and a fear of injuring the adversary too much, it is easy
to see that the latter fights under great disadvantages.  And this
conclusion, too, the North is beginning to take to heart.</p>

<p>The task which the North has undertaken now for the first time
appears to her in all its magnitude.  It is nothing less than to
conquer first, and afterwards hold in subjection a country as large as
Western and Central Europe, inhabited by six millions of freemen and
three and a half millions of slaves.  In addition to this the border
Slave States which still remain in the Union must be overawed and held
to their allegiance.  Never has a Democratic Republican nation, such
as the North now is, imposed upon itself such herculean labour.  It is
no disgrace but rather the glory of the North that the instruments fit
for carrying out such a policy are not readily obtainable.  Certainly
they are not to be found in Washington at present.  The grand army of
the North is pleasantly described by the New York <title>Tribune</title> as "a huge
picnic party," and again as a "considerable mass meeting."  The
regulars shower contempt upon the volunteers; the volunteer privates
have a profound distrust of their officers; the Commander-in-Chief
blurts out his animosity towards the Secretary of War to every chance
Congressman or editor he meets.  It is everywhere admitted that the
advance to Richmond was the idea of "General" Greeley, the editor of
the New York <title>Tribune</title>, which his journal was powerful enough to force
on the Cabinet, while the Cabinet forced it upon General Scott.
Mr. Moses Grinnell, a leading member of the Union Defence Committee,
and a man who has no personal ends to gain, publicly denounces the
Secretary of War, and he is followed by another gentleman of equal
social standing, who calls for the removal of the Secretary of the
Navy.  The Secretary of the Treasury, who retains more of the public
confidence than any other member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has been
unable to borrow a paltry million sterling in New York for pressing
exigencies, and has been compelled to resort to the limited money
markets of Boston and Philadelphia, which have responded  without
enthusiasm to his proposals.  And, in the rear of all, that portion of
the unemployed working classes in the large cities which has not
enlisted is beginning to assemble in mass meetings, and declare their
adhesion to the socialist idea that every man has an abstract right
for himself and family to be fed at the public crib of the city or
State.  The Southerners have always said that to this complexion the
starving working classes of the North must come at last in the event
of the prolongation of the war.  This evil has not reached any
magnitude as yet, but it is an ugly sign at the very beginning of a
war, and lends a sinister meaning to the expostulations of the most
earnest organs of the war party that the war <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be short and
decisive, as the industrial classes will not, and cannot, bear the
stress of a long period of public commotion.</p>

<p>Very much, then, has to be done, and we are told in the same breath
that very little time will be allowed for doing it.  It would be well
if the weak points (for aggressive purposes) of the volunteer army
were confined to incompetent officers.  We need not dwell on those
droll pictures of "Colonels" painted with such admirable candour by
the American journals for the use of some future epic poet or as
matter for some sequel to the witty "Biglow Papers"—how one Colonel,
riding well up in the van to Washington, confessed his entire
ignorance of the whereabouts and fate of his regiment; how another,
sent with despatches from General Scott to General M'Dowell, then in
the thick of the fight, refused to deliver them, pleading that, if
General Scott wanted his head shot off, he might go and deliver them
himself; of a third who relieved himself of his overwhelming doubts
and difficulties on the morning of the battle by the happy expedient
of getting dead drunk.  All this is about to be remedied by the
establishment of a Board of Examiners; but there are other things not
so easily mended.  What are we to think of fifteen out of seventeen
Pennsylvania three months' regiments refusing to stay with General
Patterson one hour beyond their stipulated time when he was in
dangerous proximity to General Johnston's army?  What of the two
Pennsylvania regiments, one of which Mr. Russell met retiring from the
field because their time was up and the other of which marched,
indeed, to the field of battle, but refused to participate in a charge
after twelve o'clock for a similar reason?  Can anything great be
achieved with such material?  While the old militia regiments of New
York city highly distinguished themselves there were others of the
recently enlisted in that city which evidently had no heart in the
work before them.  The New York 12th ran away twice in the slight
skirmish of Thursday which preceded the grand attack of Sunday;
another New York regiment so much exaggerated the practice of falling
flat on their faces before a discharge of artillery that it was found
impossible to keep them on their legs, their propensity to fall on
their knees when a musket was discharged being irresistible.  It is
not difficult to account for this.  Many of the recruits from New York
city care not a jot for the integrity of the Union, but have enlisted
to escape from starvation.  The Pennsylvania regiments, too, have many
of them a strong pro-slavery bias, and would probably prefer defending
the line of the Potomac to advancing upon Richmond on political as
well as military considerations.  It is otherwise with the New England
troops.  These men fight for an "idea;" they have a profound dislike
both of slavery and slaveowners, and would gladly see this war made
one of liberation to the slaves.  No wonder that they fought with
spirit.  The 69th (Irish), the 79th (Highlanders), and the three
German regiments including the Garibaldi Guard (who covered the
retreat and did not flee), doubtless deserve the praise they have
received.  But the true metal is sadly alloyed by the dross which is
intermingled with it, and which must immensely detract from the value
of the whole.</p>

<p>What, then, are the prospects of the war being "short and decisive"
in favour of the North?  A number of new and raw regiments are only
now pouring into Washington.  These and others must be hardened into
an army.  General Scott loudly declares that they must be practised in
tactical movements, in large "camps of instruction," before they will
be fit for the arduous duty of crushing out the revolution.  But this
long course of professional training is just that against which the
American naturally recalcitrates.  This is why he has swept away the
system of apprenticeship in all departments of industry.  If the
American volunteer overcomes his objection to regular training in this
instance, it will be a grand proof of his devotion to the cause for
which he is fighting.</p>

<p>The logic of this exposé leads whither, if not to the
conclusion that the chances are greatly against the North achieving a
permanent success in her present line of policy?  Now that she is no
longer self-blinded by illusions, she is beginning to perceive this,
and her awakened intellect is thrown back on this dilemma—emancipation
of the slaves or recognition of the Secession.  The mind of New
England is ripe for the reception of the former idea, but the people
and politicians of the Middle and Western States are not yet prepared
to follow the leadership of Messrs. Lloyd Garrison, and Wendell
Phillips.  If anything could sting the men of New York to stifle their
scruples on this matter it would be the stories which, whether true or
false, are firmly believed at the North, of the bayoneting and
mutilating the wounded, firing the hospitals, and shelling the
ambulances by the Confederates.  Messrs. Davis and Beauregard cannot
fail to know that these cruelties are as impolitic as inhuman.  Half
the people and more than half the army of the North are as little
infected with what the Southerns call the damnable heresy of
"negro-worship" as they are themselves, and regard the arming of the
slaves with positive aversion and as not consistent with the
honourable warfare.   This sentiment is a great protection to the
South, and nothing will so soon dispel it as a disregard of the laws
of civilised warfare by the South herself.  By pursuing a strictly
defensive strategy, and by twice abstaining from an attack on
Washington when he had power to make it with a good prospect of
success, Mr. Davis is disposing Northern Conservatives to give him
credit for moderation, and to believe in the sincerity of his
oft-professed desire for peace.  All that is gained by this prudent
policy will be lost in the storm of revengeful passions aroused by the
atrocities of the Confederate soldiery.  From the number of
well-cared-for wounded prisoners at Richmond it is evident that the
barbarities (so circumstantially narrated in Northern journals and
authenticated by the testimony of well-known army surgeons) were,
happily, only partial; but the Southern leaders may rest assured that
the public opinion of the civilised world only waits fuller
confirmation to visit the excesses of a portion of their victorious
army with the same stern and one-voiced reprobation which it meted out
to the Russians after Inkerman.  In the meantime, if it should turn
out that the political institutions and social and economic conditions
of Northern civilisation present almost insuperable difficulties to
the prosecution of a great aggressive war, this fact will not tell
against them among their admirers in Europe.  If there is anything
which makes the democracy of the North a less kindly soil than the
democracy of France for the development of a Napoleon I, and the
establishment of a Napoleonic system, so much the better for their own
domestic liberties, for the cause of peace on the Western Continent,
and of Republicanism throughout the world.</p>

<p>By the Montreal Company's steamer North American we have telegrams
to the evening of the 3rd inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TWO ARMIES.</p>

<p>The Confederate army has advanced its pickets to its old positions
to the north of Fairfax Court House.  It is reported that they are
fortifying Fairfax.  The Northern army "of the Potomac" keeps within
its intrenchments on the south side of the Potomac, and is undergoing
the process of reoganisation, under the vigorous superintendence of
General M'Clellan, who is invested with all the powers of
Commander-in-Chief within the military department of Columbia.  The
three-months regiments have gone or are going home, and are replaced
by the volunteers for three years.  General M'Clellan has issued an
order commanding the instant return to their several camps of the
officers and soldiers scattered round Washington at hotels and
boarding-houses, and appointing a provost-marshal to carry out this
order.  The latter had already closed up the drinking-saloons in the
capital, and the drunkenness and disorderly conduct of late so rife in
the camp had begun to diminish.  The sanitary commission had presented
their first report.  It represents the personal habits of the men as
filthy in the extreme, that the camps are all undrained, and that the
sinks are in an intolerable condition.  The supply of food by the
Federal Government is excellent and varied.  The clothing of some of
the regiments furnished by the States is very poor, but that furnished
by the Federal Government is described as good as can be desired.</p>

<p rend="center">OTHER MILITARY MOVEMENTS.</p>

<p>The army of the Upper Potomac, under the command of General Banks,
has retired into Maryland, as Mr. Banks judged Harper's Ferry to be
untenable.</p>

<p>General Butler, stationed at Fort Monrose [sic], fearing an attack,
has evacuated Hampton, burning that village on his retreat.</p>

<p>The report of the defeat of the Confederate army in Western
Virginia, near Clarksburg, was unfounded; but General Wise when last
heard of was in full retreat, throwing logs of trees athwart the roads
to impede the pursuit of General Rosencrantz at the head of the Union
forces.</p>

<p>In Missouri there have been some minor engagements, resulting to
the advantage of the Unionists.  General Pillow, commanding the
Confederates at Memphis, has issued a proclamation stating that he
will bring 20,000 men to the aid of the Secessionists of Missouri.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LOSS AT BULL RUN.</p>

<p>An official account of this battle has not yet been published, and
perhaps never will be.  An incomplete statement of the Federal losses
makes up, killed, 280; wounded, 729; missing, 477—total, 1486.  The
Confederates acknowledge a loss in killed, wounded, and missing, of
1500 men.  The Northern wounded are being well treated in the
hospitals at Richmond.  Among the prisoners was Mr. Ely, member of
Congress, from New York.  The loss fell heavily on the officers of the
Federal army.  The killed include two colonels, one
lieutenant-colonel, two majors, sixteen captains, and seven
lieutenants; and the wounded two acting majors-general, eight
colonels, one lieutenant-colonel, three majors, sixteen captains, and
thirty-three lieutenants.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, in a telegram to his wife, announces the victory as a
"dearly bought" one.  The Congress of Richmond received the news with
great dignity.  It passed resolutions thanking Almighty God for the
result of the day, and condoling with the families of the patriots who
had fallen in defence of Southern independence.</p>

<p>Robert Toombs, of Georgia, has resigned the secretaryship of State,
while Mr. R.M.T. Hunter, late United States' senator, from Virginia,
has accepted the vacant post.  No reason is assigned for this change,
but it is probably to allow Virginia, the battle-field of the two
sections, to be represented in the Executive Department of the
Confederate Government.</p>

<p>All the cotton-factors of New Orleans, through whose hands two-
thirds of the cotton crop of America are wont to pass, have signed a
document calling upon planters to keep their cotton at home, and
pledging themselves not to sell any until the blockade is entirely
raised.</p>

<p>The New Orleans <hi rend="italic">True Delta</hi> incidentally states that 
three-fourths of the men who had left that city and the State (Louisiana) in 
defence of Southern rights were Irishmen.</p>

<p>The Richmond Bank Convention has adjourned, after advising the
Government to issue 100,000,000 dollars in Treasury notes.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>Congress has passed the financial measures necessary for carrying
on the war, but not without considerable and unexpected opposition
from the Western members to the imposition of new taxes.  At one time
they succeeded in striking out the enacting clause from the Tax Bill,
but afterwards reconsidered this vote.  The loan bills, and the bill
confiscating the property of traitors and the slaves used by the enemy
in aid of the rebellion, passed with only the slight opposition which
the peace party could offer; but the tax bills ended in a double
compromise between the Eastern and Western members, and between the
Senate and the House.  The Morrill Tariff was made more protective
than before.  Tea is taxed fifteen cents (7 d.) per pound, coffee
four cents, cocoa three cents, and sugar two cents.  A tax of three
per cent is levied on all incomes above 800 dollars (168), and a
property tax of 20,000,000 dollars assessed on all the States,
including the Seceded States.  As this tax can hardly be levied, even
in the adhering Slave States, it will yield about 11,000,000 dollars.
The telegram does not inform us if the assessed tax on watches and
carriages, and the excise tax on spirituous liquors, passed the Senate
or not.</p>

<p>A resolution looking towards a compromise was introduced into the
House of Representatives by a Democratic member from Ohio, but was
voted down by 85 to 45, all the Democrats voting in favour of the
resolution.</p>

<p>The President has replied to the Address of Congress asking him to
furnish them with the correspondence with foreign Governments
concerning the blockade and maritime rights, and also requesting the
information on which he had ordered the arrest of the Police
Commissioners of Baltimore by refusing both requests as incompatible
with due regard for the interests of the nation.  He has, however,
transmitted to the Senate a report of all the instructions given to
the Foreign Ministers of the United States in reference to the
"rebellion."</p>

<p>Congress has passed a joint resolution authorising the President to take 
measures to facilitate a proper representation of the United States at the 
International Exhibition of 1862, and appropriated the sum of 2000 dollars 
therefor.</p>
<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>The Northern journals are full of accounts of the atrocities
committed by the Southern troops on the wounded Unionists.  The
returned regiments of three-month volunteers have been welcomed home
as if they had been victorious heroes.</p>

<p>A writ of habeas corpus taken out by the British Consul in New York
in behalf of Purcell M'Quillan, a British subject, from Charleston,
who took his passport, issued by the British Consul at Charleston, was
arrested by order of Secretary Seward and sent manacled to New York,
where he had been in military custody since June 28, had been without
effect, the military officer, with the assent of General Scott,
refusing to obey it.  The Supreme Court of the State of New York
refuses to take any further action, declining to give rise to the
scandal of a collision between the judicial and military authorities
merely in behalf of the liberty of a British subject.</p>

<p>Another important case before the New York Courts has been
postponed until October.  The crew of the privateer Savannah have not
been brought up for trial, doubtless because Mr. Lincoln fears that
their certain condemnation and execution as pirates would call forth
the retaliation on Northern prisoners of war with which Mr. Davis
threatened him.</p>

<p>The negro steward who killed three of the prize privateer crew put
on board the schooner Waring is on exhibition at Barnum's Museum, New
York, at a salary of 100 dollars per diem.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon, the Princess Clotilde, and suite arrived at New
York on the 27th ult.  No public demonstration took place.  He resided
on board the yacht, and visited the city during the day.  On the 31st
he departed for Washington, on the invitation of the President.
Princess Clotilde has engaged a suite of apartments at the New York
Hotel, where she will reside during the Prince's absence.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The Governor-General of Cuba has released the six United States
ships taken as prizes into Cienfuegos, and ordered the privateer
Sumter to go to sea.</p>

<p>The Missouri State Convention has declared vacant the seats of the
Governor and other Secessionist members of the State Government.</p>

<p>Eleven officers who served in Italy with Garibaldi have enlisted
under General Lane, of Kansas, for service in Missouri and the Far
West.</p>

<p>Although the Pacific Railroad and other works characteristic of an
era of peaceful progress have been stopped by the civil war, the daily
overland mail-coach carrying the mails between the Atlantic and
Pacific coasts is in successful operation.  The first eastward-bound
coach arrived from Sacramento at St. Joseph, Missouri, after a journey
of seventeen days and one hour.  This is the longest coach route in
the world.  The telegraphic poles and wires which are destined to join
San Francisco with New York are also being rapidly set up on the
western plains; and it is hoped that, come what may, the connection
will be complete by December of this year.</p>

<p>The Americans have invented an "elevator" for reconnoitring purposes.  It is 
a telescopic tube of sheet iron, raised by a windlass.  It can be elevated fifty
 feet in four minutes, and lowered in one minute; weighs 1700lb., and can be 
drawn by one horse easily.  At fifty feet troops are seen distinctly nine miles; 
at a hundred feet, fifteen miles.  They have also invented an indiarubber 
"yoke" for knapsacks, which dispenses with the straps, and is said to relieve 
the burden most materially.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist, who was present at the 
battle of Bull Run, has sent us some Sketches of the fight and the flight, 
two of which are engraved on the preceding page.  He writes as follows 
respecting the first Illustration:—"About midday the battle raged at its 
highest.  Two of the most gallant charges that I witnessed on the portion 
of the field where I had taken position, with the first-named regiment, 
form the subject of the accompanying Sketch.  The battery on the right was 
a flying one, supported by a strong body of Confederate infantry hid in 
the ravine and in the thicket at the top of the hill.  On the approach of 
the 27th Regiment they hastily retreated to the crest of the rise behind 
their battery, after firing a volley; and on the Federalists steadily 
advancing the guns were also limbered up and withdrawn from their position.  
The 27th lost 27 killed and 69 wounded out of a force of 900 men.  On the 
right the 14th New York are rushing at an earthwork mounting position-guns, 
but, owing to the galling fire of the Confederate sharp-shooters in the 
woods and the admirable serving of the pieces in battery, were forced to 
retire with severe loss."</p>

Virginia.  Retreat is a weak term to use when speaking of this disgraceful 
rout, for which there was no excuse.  The terror-stricken soldiers threw 
away their arms and accoutrements, herding along like a panic-stricken flock 
of sheep, with no order whatever in their flight.  Those who had been 
fortunate enough to get places in the baggage-waggons thrust back others 
with their bayonets and musket-stocks.  Wounded men were crushed under 
the wheels of the heavy, lumbering chariots that dashed down the road at 
full speed.  Light buggies, containing members of Congress, were overturned 
or dashed to pieces in the horrible confusion of the panic."</p>

<p>Whatever may be the condition of the crops in America, the state of the 
body politic renders any large cereal exportation from that country at least 
problematical.  No doubt efforts will be made to convert as much of its 
produce into money as is possible, if only for the purpose of bringing 
within that territory the sinews of war.  Looking at the question from this 
point of view, we cannot but see an additional, although a remote, cause of 
congratulation in the hopes of an adequate harvest in this country.  
Supposing that we had to demand and to pay for in money a similar supply 
of corn from America this year as we had to ask in 1860, and supposing that 
that country was able to give us half that we asked, there would be at once 
a direct stimulus and sustentation afforded to that unhappy civil war which 
is raging.  The influence of England is felt in every country in the world, 
openly or silently, as the case may be; and probably nowhere is her monetary 
and commercial influence more felt, however little acknowledged, than in 
that region which we yet call, and hope still to call, the United States of 
America.  It will be something to be proud of if the plenty of England 
should indirectly contribute to the peace of America.  It would not be 
difficult to point out how the absence of those disturbing causes which 
interfere with the facile working of our political, social, and commercial 
arrangements, and which turn on a good or bad harvest, would operate on the 
tranquillity of Europe; but with that part of the subject we do not propose 
to deal. . . .</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Frilling</hi>.-There appeared a few months 
back in a literary periodical some curious particulars of the capabilities 
of the sewing-machine, an invention which is now so extensively employed 
in the world of industrial production.  We were told that amongst its 
multifarious applications this machine had been employed not only to sew 
garments of every kind, but every form of thick leather, the most delicate 
fabrics of the loom, the finest laces, ships' sails, and paper; even hose 
for draining the mines of California had passed under its operation.  One 
of its applications, however, was not mentioned, and this is of a kind that 
will especially attract the attention of the ladies.  A contrivance has 
been recently invented of a very simple character, which, when combined with 
an ordinary sewing-machine, will produce by their joint action a beautifully 
regular frill.  This frill can be either firmly sewed separately or at once 
attached to a plain band or to some part of a dress.  By the expression firmly 
sewed we mean a frill which cannot be drawn up and down the thread, but one 
of which every plait or gather is tightly held and secured.  The neatness 
of the work in very pleasing to the eye; and the plain band frill an be 
produced very cheaply.  It will probably shortly be for sale in every 
draper's shop in the empire.  We have lately seen some frill-making machines 
at work, and observed the rapidity and regularity with which the article 
can be produced.  The invention is, we believe, of American origin.  This 
is something beyond a labour-saving machine, since no similar article of 
manufacture has ever before been brought into the market.  Hence it has 
been made the subject of a patent.  All the processes are conducted by girls, 
and another source of employment is furnished to our female population.</p>

expelled from Kanawha, and requested that the mail service may be resumed.  
At Athens and at Dug Spring, nineteen miles south of Springfield, Missouri, 
engagements have taken place in which the Secessionists were worsted.   In 
the latter a body of United States' cavalry, under General Lyon, 270 strong, 
are said to have cut their way through a body of infantry more than ten times 
their number.  Eight of the former were killed and 30 wounded; while 40 of 
the latter were left dead on the field, and 44 wounded.</p>
<p>The coast of North Carolina, which has never been thoroughly blockaded, 
is swarming with privateers, who prey upon Northern commerce, and take their 
prizes into port without molestation.  Newbern, in this State, is a 
favourite rendezvous.  Land batteries are erected at several points to 
protect the privateer from her pursuer.  <hi rend="italic">En revanche</hi>, the blockading squadron 
off Galveston has captured recently eleven ships belonging to the Confederates; 
and on the 1st inst. the United States' frigate St. Lawrence sunk a privateer 
off Charleston.  The privateer, mistaking the ship-of-war for a merchantman, 
ran out of Charleston harbour, and fired into her.  The St. Lawrence returned 
a broadside with the above result.  Five of the crew were drowned, and the 
remaining thirty-six have been sent to Fort Mifflin, below Philadelphia.</p>

<p rend="center">ARMY NEWS.</p>
<p>The "grand army of the Potomac," the army of the Upper Potomac, and the 
garrison in and around Fort Monroe are inactive for the present, General 
M'Clellan has cautioned the journals and their correspondents to say nothing 
of his movements, a caution which the prudence and patriotism of the editors 
alike incline them to obey.  From Mr. Russell's letters we learn that the 
new three-year volunteers "are not equal to the departed three-months men, 
and the camps are certainly not as well filled."  From other sources we are 
informed that the young commander, who inspires the greatest confidence, 
is brigading the newly-arrived regiments.</p>
<p>General Butler, at Fort Monroe, reports that he is in possession of 900 
negroes—men, women, and children; and writes to the Secretary for War to 
know what he is to do with them, advising, at the same time, that they be 
liberated.  The reply of Secretary Cameron has not yet appeared.</p>

<p rend="center">BULL RUN.</p>
<p>Full Southern accounts of the battle of Bull Run inform us that Jefferson 
Davis did not arrive on the field of battle until after the day was won, and 
that it was the arrival of General Kirby Smith with 4000 fresh troops belonging 
to Johnston's army which decided the fortunes of the day.  Not more than half 
of Johnson's division effected their junction with Beauregard in season to 
take part in the fight.  An engine-driver bringing up troops from Richmond 
purposely ran the train off the track and delayed the arrival of the 
reinforcements.  He was shot after confessing his treachery to the cause he 
was supposed to be serving.  General Bee, of South Carolina, Colonel Bartow, 
of Georgia, and Colonel Johnson, of South Carolina, were slain on the 
Confederate side.  Colonel Wade Hampton, the richest man in the South, 
was seriously wounded in the cheek.</p>
<p>General M'Dowell has at last made a report of the Federal loss at Bull 
Run:—Killed, 19 officers and 462 men; wounded, 64 officers and 947 men; 
missing, 40 officers and 1176 men.  He also reports the loss of 23 pieces 
of artillery, 100 boxes of cartridges, 87 boxes of rifled-cannon ammunition, 
30 boxes of old firearms, 13 loaded provision-waggons, 3000 bushels of oats, 
2500 muskets, and 8000 knapsacks and blankets.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The Southern Congress is still in session at Richmond.</p>
<p>The Southern journals give a list of clergymen who are officers in the 
Confederate army.</p>
<p>It is stated that much British gold is in circulation at Richmond, 
which has been advanced for the new cotton crop.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>
<p>The Federal Congress adjourned on the 6th inst. until the first Monday 
in December.  One of its last measures was to increase the pay of the 
soldiers and sailors by two dollars per month.  The legislation of the 
late special Session is of the most important character, having accomplished 
a revolution in the finance of the Republic and armed the President with 
the prerogatives of a military despot.  Among other less striking changes 
is one abolishing the sub-Treasury and anti-bank policy, for which the 
Democratic party strove so successfully a quarter of a century ago.  The 
proceeds of the 250,000,000 dollar loan may remain in solvent banks until 
drawn out by the Government, instead of being paid immediately into the 
Treasury or sub-Treasury in gold and silver.</p>
<p>The assessments on gold and silver watches and pleasure-carriages were 
struck out of the tax bill by the Conference Committee of the two Houses.</p>
<p>The President, it is said, yielded a very reluctant assent to the Act 
confiscating slaves used in aid of the rebellion.</p>
<p>Members of Congress were paid their 300 dols. salary, one sixth in gold 
and five sixths in Treasury notes, bearing six per cent interest.  Henceforth 
all Government salaries will be paid in this sort of money.  These notes, 
payable in two years, are discounted by the brokers for 5 per cent commission.
</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
<p>The steamers from Europe bring frequent consignments of arms, chiefly on 
account of the several States.</p>
<p>Immigration has fallen off but slightly in consequence of the civil war, 
being at New York, the principal port, 50,000 for the first seven months of 
this year against 60,000 in the corresponding period of 1860.</p>
<p>The watering-places are deserted, and the hotelkeepers ruined; the 
prostration of business having left the Northern pleasure-seekers no money 
for enjoyment, and the corresponding class in the South being engaged in 
fighting.</p>
<p>The heat has been very great of late.  On the 4th inst. the thermometer in 
St. Louis marked 105 degrees in the shade, and the next day fifteen deaths from 
<hi rend="italic">coup de soleil</hi> were  reported in the papers of that city.</p>
<p>Claflin, Mellen, and Co., the second dry-goods jobbing-house in the United 
States, and the owners of the finest store in Broadway, have failed, with 
liabilities amounting to more than £600,000.  Their receipts from the South 
have been entirely cut off, and those from the West very nearly so.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin and her niece had arrived at San Francisco from the Sandwich 
Islands,  The Irish of this city have held a meeting and resolved to send the 
remains of the late Irish exile, T.B. M'Manus, to Ireland by way of New York.  
The funeral procession was to have taken place on the 20th instant, and the 
remains were to have been forwarded by the steamer sailing on the 21st.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BORDER STATES.</p>
<p>The West Virginian Convention met at Wheeling on the 6th inst., and resolved 
to separate from Eastern Virginia for ever.  In this they are acting in 
defiance of the Governments both of the United and Confederate States.  The 
former desires the mountaineers to maintain their connection with the rest of 
Virginia, in order to be able to recognise their local Government as the 
legal State Government.  The reasons why the latter should oppose their 
secession from the State are obvious.</p>
<p>The peace party at Baltimore have given a public dinner to Messrs. 
Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Vallandingham, of Ohio, at the Eutaw House, 
in token of their appreciation of the courageous advocacy by these two 
gentlemen of the cause of peace during the late special Session of Congress.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> kith and kin on the other side of the 
Atlantic are beginning to graduate in their self-constructed new school—war.  
It was a very pretty pageant as long as it was confined to strutting about in 
fantastic uniforms, winning the smiles of the New York beauties and fulminating 
furious tirades in newspapers.  It is quite another thing now when what might 
have been a substantial success, or, at the worst, a drawn game, at Bull Run, 
has been converted into a <hi rend="italic">stampede</hi>, in which "devil 
take the hindmost" seems to have been the only order of the day.  Nothing comes 
out clearer now than that the ill-starred attack of the Northern men was 
undertaken in obedience to unwarlike and inexperienced politicians, and in 
utter defiance of the advice of the very few men of actual military experience 
who have commands in their army.  A more wholesome condition of affairs has 
been  inaugurated by the Bull Run rout.  The three months' men are 
abandoning their posts in favour of volunteers who consider three years a 
far more reasonable allotment of time for fair drilling; and the American 
press generally has come to an understanding with the General, which 
tardily recognises the impolicy of publishing for your antagonist's benefit 
a daily programme of your movements and intentions, and the public of the 
States are universally recognising the truth and weight of the axiom so 
often laid down and so repeatedly laughed at by the public before the days 
of our volunteer corps by officers of experience, that drill—drill—drill—is 
essential to the formation of an efficient soldier.  Drill reduced to 
practice means the almost mechanical movement of the human machine in one 
direction or another, instantaneously consequent on the utterance of the 
word of command, whether by mouth or bugle.  It is in this that the Northern 
levies were deficient, and it was for want of this that they were routed—a 
good lesson to our own volunteers, which Colonel M'Murdo has not been slow 
to impress on them.</p>

<p>   The great point of interest on the south coast is Cape Race—the subject 
of Illustration—as it is the point of land which nearly all the steamers 
running to New York, Boston, and Portland endeavour to make.  The coast at Cape 
Race is bold and rocky, the cliffs rising precipitately out of the water, 
cracked and split asunder in many places by some great convulsion of nature; 
a huge black rock lifts its head up out of the deep water immediately in 
front of the Cape; the eternal wash of the Atlantic has worn deep hollows, 
and in some cases masses of rock stand out isolated from the great granite 
wall that breaks the ever-restless ocean that thunders against it.  On top 
of the cliffs, a short distance from the edge, is a well-built lighthouse 
painted white and striped with red vertical stripes, which distinguishes 
it from the lighthouse on Cape Pine, an important point of the coast, about 
thirty miles west of Cape Race, where the lighthouse is striped with 
horizontal red stripes.</p> 
<p>   Cape Race is also the terminal point eastward of that remarkable 
system of telegraph lines which extends throughout the whole of the 
United States and the British possessions.  The Americans delight in 
the telegraph, and use it continually for every sort of purpose, and in 
a way and extent that Europeans have no notion of.  From this lonely 
rock, standing out in the Atlantic amid fogs and storms, European news is 
flashed to the most distant parts of America.  From Boston to New Orleans 
the newspapers have it, print it, and the intelligence is old when the 
ship arrives at New York, three or four days after passing Cape Race.</p>
<p>   As there is no place on this iron-bound coast where ships can touch 
at, peculiar means must be adopted to catch the European news on its way 
west.  The Associated Press of America therefore employ vessels to cruise 
constantly in the neighbourhood of the Cape, and board the outward-bound 
steamships.  Having got the important intelligence, they hasten to the shore, 
and forward their dispatch by wires passing through Newfoundland, across 
the sea between it and Breten Island, and afterwards the Gut of Chanseau, 
through Nova Scotia, across the head of the Bay of Fundy, to the United 
States.</p>
<p>   This arrangement of telegraph brings Europe practically within seven 
days of America.  Thus the Cunard ships leaving New York on Wednesday are 
off Cape Race the following Sunday; being there boarded by the telegraph-boat, 
they receive the New York news up to that time; on the following Sunday that 
ship arrives at Cork harbour, Ireland, when its news is instantly forwarded 
to London.  And the same on the outward-bound voyages.</p>
 <p>  Since the introduction of the electric telegraph this lonely mass of 
storm-washed rock, whose existence was scarcely known to any one except the 
mariner, who sought it only that he might know his whereabout and carefully 
avoid it, has become as well known and its name as familiar as is that of 
New York or Boston.  It would be difficult to take up an American newspaper 
now without finding a paragraph headed "Latest News from Europe, viâ Cape 
Race."</p>
<p>   On the western side of the States the telegraph ends at the Missouri 
River; but, as the States on the west side of the Rocky Mountains arei 
[sic] as anxious for early news as the Yankees themselves, the latest 
intelligence from Europe, being passed through to the Missouri, is then 
taken up by a remarkable line of communication called the Pony Express—a 
line of small, fleet horses being maintained across the great plains, over 
the Rocky Mountains, to San Francisco.  On arrival of the telegraph from 
Cape Race at St. Joseph, on the Missouri, a horse starts at a gallop on its 
journey west.  Every twenty-five miles a fresh horse is employed to carry 
the telegraph message.  The journey of two thousand miles is thus accomplished 
in about nine days, so connecting California with England in little over a 
fortnight.</p>

<p>By the United States' steamer Fulton we have received New York journals 
of the 17th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>
<p>The war which languishes in Virginia continues active in Southern Missouri.  
On the 10th inst. General Lyon, with about 5500 Federals, well armed and 
provided with artillery, attacked, nine miles south-east of Springfield, a 
force of the enemy greatly superior in numbers, but inferior in weapons and 
artillery, and consisting of troops from Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and of 
Cherokee Indians, drove them from their intrenchments, and set fire to all 
their tents and baggage-waggons.  General Lyon was killed early in the fight, 
and the command devolved on General Siegel (a German by birth, who has seen 
service in Europe).  General Siegel, fearing for his communications, 
retreated the next day to Rolla, a station on the south-western branch of 
the Missouri and Pacific Railroad.  In his retreat General Siegel left 
behind him three guns, which he spiked and the carriages of which he destroyed.
  The Federals, who at first claimed a victory, now only regard it as a drawn 
battle.  The loss of the Federals is set down at from 800 to half that number.
  The loss of the Confederates is unknown.  Ninety prisoners were taken by the 
former.</p>
<p>The report of this engagement caused so much excitement among the people of 
St. Louis, where opinion is about equally divided  between the two parties, 
that General Fremont proclaimed that city in a state of siege and "effected 
a loan" of 250,000 dollars from the banks.</p>
<p>The inefficiency of the blockade is loudly complained of by the Northerners.
  The Southern privateers are heard of everywhere on the coast of South America.
  The Secretary of the Navy is chartering or purchasing vessels, and 
contracting for the building of gun-boats, so as to render the blockade 
really efficient.</p>

<p rend="center">MUTINY AND DESERTIONS.</p>
<p>The idleness of the army of the Potomac has bred a mutinous spirit.  The 
79th (Highland) Regiment, the 2nd Maine Regiment, and portions of several 
others, have revolted, and been forced to lay down their arms.  The ringleaders 
are under arrest, and will be banished to the Tortugas group of islands.  
Desertions are numerous.  The New York Fire Zouave Regiment has melted 
away and been disbanded.  The reasons given for this conduct are 
dissatisfaction with their officers and indisposition to serve three years.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL M'DOWELL'S REPORT ON BULL RUN.</p>
<p>This officer has at length made a report on the battle of Bull Run which 
is commendable for its truthful and umbombastic character.  After describing 
the now well-known features of this battle, and the loss in killed and 
wounded, he says:—</p>
<p>The return of the missing is very inaccurate, the men supposed to be 
missing having fallen into other regiments, and gone to Washington—many 
of the Zouaves to New York.</p>

<p>The causes of the defeat are stated to be the unavoidable delay in 
marching forward, arising from the tardy movements of the troops and the 
inefficient supply of ammunition and subsistence waggons.  The movement, 
which should have commenced on the 8th, was postponed till the 16th.  The 
disorder of the waggon-managers caused the delay of another day.  The troops 
took two days instead of one to march thirteen miles, and the regimental 
and division officers insisted that the troops could not do better.  
These delays gave the enemy four days' notice of the attack.</p>

<p>In estimating (says the General) the force to go against Manassas I 
engaged not to have to do with the enemy's forces under Johnston, then kept 
in check by General Patterson.  This was not done, and the enemy was free 
to assemble from every direction in numbers only limited by the amount of 
his railroad rolling stock and his supply of provisions.  I could not, as 
I have said, more early push on faster, nor could I delay.  A large, and 
the best, part of my forces were three months volunteers, whose term of 
service was about to expire, but who were sent forward as having long enough 
to serve for the purpose of the expedition.  On the eve of the battle the 
4th Pennsylvania Regiment of Volunteers, and the battery of Volunteer 
Artillery of the New York 8th Militia, whose tern of service expired, 
insisted on their discharge.  I wrote to the regiment, expressing a request 
for them to remain a short time, and the Hon. Secretary of War, who was at 
the time on the ground, tried to induce the battery to remain at least five 
days.  But in vain.  They insisted on their discharge that night.  It was 
granted, and the next morning, when the army moved forward into battle, 
these troops moved to the rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon.  In the 
next few days, day by day, I should have lost 10,000 of the best armed, 
drilled, officered, and disciplined troops in the army.  In other words, 
every day which added to the strength of the enemy made us weaker.</p>
<p>The object of the advance is declared to have been</p>
<p>that of getting to the railroad leading from Manassas to the Valley of 
Virginia, and going on it far enough to break up and destroy the communication, 
and interpose between the forces under Beauregard and those under Johnston; 
and, could we have fought a day or a few hours sooner, there is everything to 
show how we could have continued successful, even against the odds with which 
we contended.</p>
<p>The report of the Commissary-General avers that three days' provisions were 
served out to the divisional head-quarters on the day before the fight, but 
that many of the soldiers threw their knapsacks away before going into battle, 
while the Commissaries of some regiments neglected to send for their quotas to 
the divisional dépôts.  This accounts for the want of food of which 
the troops have since so much complained.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL LOAN.</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury has succeeded in negotiating 50,000,000 
dollars of the national loan with the New York, Boston, and Philadelphia banks.
  The former city furnishes three-fifths, Boston three-tenths, and Philadelphia 
one-tenth of the whole.  The banks refused to touch the 6 and 7 per cent bonds, 
and preferred the 7 3-10 per cent Treasury notes.  They made rather hard terms 
with Secretary Chase.  He agrees not to avail himself of his right to issue the
 6 and 7 per cent bonds.  The interest is to run on the loan from Aug. 15, 
although the loan is only to be drawn from the banks by degrees and as it [is] 
wanted.  The 12,000,000 of Treasury notes already issued are to be accepted in
 part payment of the loan; so that, in fact, the banks only advance 38,000,000
 dollars.  They have secured the privilege of taking 100,000,000 dollars more 
on the same terms as the foregoing.  On the other hand, Mr. Chase is allowed 
to accept tenders from the public for the national loan, and to issue Treasury 
notes payable on demand.  This last stipulation was only carried after 
considerable opposition from some of the banks.  Stocks have risen as a 
consequence of this negotiation, and Mr. Chase has returned to Washington.  
He declared to the assembled bankers that his expenditure amounted to one 
million dollars a day.</p>

<p rend="center">THE STATUS OF SLAVES.</p>
<p>Secretary Cameron, in reply to the letter of General Butler, says that 
slaves escaping from loyal masters in the Seceded States may be detained 
and set to work.  "Upon the return of peace Congress will doubtless 
properly provide for all the persons it has received into the service of 
the Union, and for a just compensation to loyal masters."  But the slaves 
of peaceful citizens are not to be enticed away, nor is the voluntary return 
of any fugitive to be hindered, except where inconsistent with the public 
good.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PRESIDENT.</p>
	  <p>Mr. Lincoln has issued proclamations for a national fast and 
humiliation on the last Thursday in September, and for prohibiting all 
intercourse between the United and Confederate States.  This, if enforced, 
will put a stop to the intercourse which has been hitherto maintained 
through the State of Kentucky.</p>

<p rend="center">PERSONAL.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon has visited the Southern army at Manassas, 
sleeping one night there with General Johnston.  Mr. Seward made no 
objection to this visit; but it was eyed unfavourably by Northern public 
opinion.  He reports that both armies are undisciplined, and that the result 
of the next battle will depend on an accident.  The Prince has returned to 
New York, and was about to set out on his Western tour.</p>
	  <p>Major-General Wool, the oldest officer in the United States' 
service next to General Scott, has been ordered to Fort Monroe to 
supersede <pb n="209"/>General Butler, a Massachusetts lawyer, in command 
of that post.  This appointment gives universal satisfaction.</p>
	  <p>Purcell M'Quillan, the incarcerated British subject, whom 
the Commander of Fort Lafayette refused to bring into court on a writ of 
habeas corpus, has been released by the Secretary of War in consequence 
of the intervention of Lord Lyons.</p>
	  <p>A Mr. Serrill, passenger to New York on board the Persia, 
who boasted that he had effected a loan in behalf of the Confederate States 
in England, was searched on his arrival in port, and £10,000 in Bank of 
England notes were discovered, concealed in a belt about his waist.</p>
	  <p>But the most important arrest that has yet been made is that 
of Mr. Faulkner, of Virginia, the late United States' Minister to France.  
Mr. Faulkner went to Washington to pay the usual visit of courtesy to the 
Foreign Secretary, and was thereupon arrested on a charge of treason, for 
acts committed at Paris, in purchasing arms for the Confederates while 
representing the United States, and endeavouring to procure the recognition 
of the Southern Confederacy by the Government of France.</p>

<p>We in Europe, who are, unfortunately, only too accustomed to war, 
watch with much interest the progress which our American kinsmen are 
making in the study of this noble art.  A second engagement, on nothing 
like the scale of the Bull Run affair, but of quite sufficient importance 
to earn its title of a "battle," has fully justified the Premier in saying,
 as he did at Dover, that there is no want of pluck among them, only of 
discipline.  We gladly indorse the judgment.  We all know what a dozen 
disciplined policemen accustomed to act in concert can effect against a 
wild, scrambling mob; and the "rapid movement" at Bull Run is only a new 
proof of the truth of the old military axiom that of undisciplined men 
the more you have the greater your danger.  The Springfield affair shows 
what sort of stuff there really is in these kinsmen of ours; and we only 
grieve to think what a bitter school is that in which they are learning, 
and how bitter for many a year to come may be the fruits of this system of 
education to them, to us, and to the world.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist in the Confederate camp, 
referring to an engagement between 71st New York and an Alabama regiment at 
the battle at Bull Run, which forms the subject of our Illustration on page 
226, writes as follows:—"This was the only case in which I saw two regiments 
positively engage each other, and these did no more than blaze away at each 
other at a distance of three hundred yards until both were badly cut up.  The 
Alabama regiment especially suffered, and when they retired they left the 
ground covered with their dead and wounded.  The 71st lost heavily; but they 
behaved exceedingly well, loading and firing as though on parade.  I think 
that if the bayonet had been used more freely the matter would have been 
sooner decided, and with less loss of life.  On the hill at the back a 
Confederate battery was playing on the 71st.  I was on the right of the 
latter regiment."</p>

<p>By the arrival of the Nova Scotiau [sic] at Londonderry, from Quebec, we 
have intelligence from New York to the 23rd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>There has been another panic, real or pretended, among the 
military authorities at Washington, caused by a rumoured intended crossing 
of the Potomac by the enemy below Washington, and an advance upon the capital.  
It was said that there was a fleet of launches and flat boats near Acquia 
Creek, which were to be used in transporting Confederate troops across the 
river.  The Governors of ten States were telegraphed to send on immediately 
whatever troops they had, whether equipped, armed, or uniformed, or not, in 
squads or companies, as the case might be.  These messages caused great alarm 
in the North, and possibly stimulated the recruiting business.  The apprehended 
attack was, however, never made, and the transport fleet vanished into thin 
air.</p>
	  <p>There have been some more manifestations of an insubordinate 
spirit among two New York Regiments of the army of the Potomac—manifestations 
which were suppressed with General M'Clellan's usual vigour.</p>
	  <p>In Missouri there have been two skirmishes favourable to the 
Federalists.  The town of Commerce in the south-eastern portion of that 
State has been taken and retaken, and a Federal steamer plying on the 
Mississippi fired into and sunk.  General M'Culloch was not killed in the 
engagement of Dug Spring, as reported by the Federals.</p>
	  <p>In the territory of New Mexico the Confederates have been 
active; 1500 of these have compelled the surrender of Major Lynd and a 
regiment of Federal troops garrisoning Fort Fillmore.</p>
	  <p>The privateer Sumter, though often reported captured, was 
still at liberty off Laguayara, Venezuela.  The Venezuelan Government 
refused her admittance into port, and had sent a vessel to retake two 
United States' ships which the Sumter had taken.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>
<p>Commander Hickey, of H.B.M. steamer Gladiator, has complained to Commodore 
Stringham that the blockade is left open at four points on the coast of North 
Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
	  <p>The new cotton crop, about the destiny of which there is so much 
uneasiness in Europe, is now being picked.</p>
	  <p>A letter from a well-known South Carolinian in Virginia, dated 
the 12th ult., says of the condition of the army, "The supplies of clothing 
are not enough, and the destitution of the soldiery in clothing and food is 
terrible; many applications are made to us by men in health, who wish to 
escape sickness, for an extra pair of drawers, socks, or undershirts.  It 
will require every nerve to be strained by you and ourselves here to meet 
the exigencies of the fall and winter should the war last so long."</p>
	  <p>The Governors of several States have issued proclamations, 
addressed to the female part of the community, begging them to employ their 
time in knitting socks for the army, and calling for a subsidy of blankets.  
The <title>Charleston Courier</title> says that the measles is sweeping through the army, 
and that over 3000 are ill.</p>
	  <p>Half of the colleges at the South have suspended operations, 
the students having enlisted for the war.</p>

<p rend="center">WESTERN VIRGINIA.</p>
	  <p>On the 20th ult. the Wheeling Convention passed an ordinance 
creating the new State of Kanawha by a vote of 50 to 28.  The boundary, as 
fixed, includes thirty-one counties of the Trans-Alleghany region of Virginia.
  A provision was incorporated permitting certain adjoining counties to come 
in, if they desire, by the vote of a majority of their people.  The ordinance 
also provides for the election of delegates to a convention to form a 
Constitution.  On the 24th proxximo the question "For a new State" or 
"Against a New State" will be submitted to the popular vote.  Attorney-General 
Bates highly disapproves of this policy of dismembering the State of Virginia, 
because it countenances a policy of revolution and runs counter to the 
Constitutions both of the State and the nation.  The Administration desired 
that the loyal people of Western Virginia should continue to maintain the 
fiction that they were the true Government of Virginia, so that the Federal 
Government might seem to be fighting under the additional sanction of the 
State Government.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
	  <p>Secretary Seward has issued an order establishing a passport 
system for foreign travel.  No person will henceforth be allowed to go abroad 
from a port of the United States without a passport, and no one will be allowed 
to land in the United States without a passport from a Minister or Consul of 
the United States; or, if a foreigner, from his own Government, countersigned 
by some Minister or Consul.  This regulation is not to take effect in regard to 
westward-bound passengers until a reasonable time shall have elapsed for it to 
become known in the country from which they proceed.</p>
<p>Numerous petitions from the Federal prisoners at Richmond have been received by 
the President praying for a recognition of the Confederate Government as 
belligerents so far as to allow of an exchange of prisoners.  The President 
is, however, firmly opposed to doing any act which shall have the appearance 
of recognising the Confederates as other than rebels or rioters.</p>
	  <p>In order not to give ground for any retaliatory proceedings, 
no trial of privateers, nor any prisoners confined by the Government on 
charges of treason, will take place until the conclusion of the contest.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
	  <p>The Federal Government had arrested at Philadelphia Mr. Pierce 
Butler (the husband of Fanny Kemble), William B. Reed, the late U.S. 
Plenipotentiary in China, and several other prominent citizens, for holding 
treasonable intercourse with the enemy.</p>
	  <p> Mr. Russell's description of the flight from Bull Run had been 
republished in the principal Transatlantic journals.  The New York <title>World</title> 
calls it "graphic and truthful," and the organs of the better sort take it 
in good part, but the editorial comments of the <title>Times</title> on the affair are 
looked upon with less favour.</p>
	  <p>A persecution of the peace-party newspapers has suddenly sprung 
up.  In Bangor (Maine), Concord (New Hampshire), and Easton (Pennsylvania), 
the materiel of peace-party newspapers has been destroyed.  In Haverhill 
(Mass.) a peace editor has been tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail, and 
forced to take an oath that he would write no more articles in a spirit 
opposed to the war.  In New York and Brooklyn the five journals in favour of 
peace have been presented by the grand jury of the district as guilty of 
treason.  One of these journals is a Catholic organ.  The <hi rend="italic">
Christian Observer</hi>, an organ of the Presbyterians, has been seized in 
New York for "a virulent article on the war," which means a "virulent" article 
in favour of peace.  The office in Philadelphia of the <hi rend="italic">New 
York Daily News</hi> has for similar reasons been suppressed, and the United 
States' Marshals in that city, on the arrival of the mail train from New York, 
seized every copy of this journal, including all its Southern and Western 
circulation.  A peace meeting has also been broken up by a mob in Saybrook, 
Connecticut.</p>
	  <p>The Democratic party in the United States refuses all offers of 
union with the Republicans, but is hopelessly divided into a war and peace 
section.  They seem generally to condemn the suspension by the President of 
the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon and suite have passed through Cleveland and 
Detroit en route for Lake Superior.  At the latter place the Prince was the 
guest of General Cass.</p>
	  <p>The £40,000 in Bank of England notes reported in our last to 
have been seized on the person of Mr. Serrill, a passenger to New York by the 
Persia, and supposed to be an agent of the Confederate Government, turn out to 
have been Bank post bills, of no value without Mr. Serrill's endorsement.</p>

<p rend="center">COMMERCE AND FINANCE.</p>
	  <p>The export of bread stuffs from New York to France begins to be 
large.</p>
	  <p>The Boston banks will only take 10,000,000 dollars instead of 
15,000,000 dollars of the new loan, as at first agreed upon by the Boston 
deputation at New York.  The New York banks immediately assumed the 
subscription for the extra sum.</p>
	  <p>In the year ending June 30, 1861, California exported—of 
wheat, 3,533,744 bushels, and of barley and oats, 600,000 bushels more.</p>

<p>Had any one hinted some twelve months back at the possibility of the 
United States being the next arena for the display of the antiquated 
resources of martial law, suspension of habeas corpus, and the passport 
system, he would have been met with a shout of derisive laughter.   We have 
lived, however, to see these things as living, tangible facts.  They are 
excused and apologised for as political necessities belonging to the 
exigencies of the occasion.  It is amusing, however—rather sadly amusing, 
by the way—to see the New Country driven to avail itself of the long-despised 
weapons of the Old World.  Meanwhile, every one is anxiously inquiring "What 
next?"</p>
	  <p>The great cotton question is assuming a singular aspect.  Reports 
give a good crop to the Southern States; they are elevated with their military 
successes; and there is an idea abroad that they mean to keep, instead of 
trying to find, a market.  This view of the matter complicates the state of 
things explained by us last week.  Of what use it is for British shipping to 
attempt to force the so-called blockade if the Southern men will not sell 
when they have done so?  We venture, however, to think that the full facts 
are as yet but imperfectly understood in the South.  They evidently rely on 
their superiority in quality.  We have reason to think they are reckoning 
without their host.</p>

	  <p>Letters from the Red River colony, in the Hudson's Bay territory, 
announce the discovery of a valuable goldfield, by a party of American miners 
from California, in the north branch of the Saskatchewan.  Two Californian 
gentlemen have recently arrived at St. Paul's, Minnesota, with a considerable 
quantity of gold, collected by themselves, along the upper waters of the 
Saskatchewan, and they describe the yield and quality of the metal as promising 
to be quite equal to that of British Columbia, which occupies the opposite 
flank of the Rocky Mountains, and may therefore reasonably be inferred to be 
of a similar geological character, while it is known to be watered by streams 
which have a common origin in the same auriferous range with the northern 
tributaries of the Saskatchewan.</p>

	  <p>Numerous letters confirm the great value of the oil-springs 
lately discovered in the United States and Canada.  The question as to the 
duration of their yield remains to be settled, but it seems probable that, 
owing to the extent of the regions in which they are found, the supply will 
last many years, and that a proper organisation of railway facilities will 
alone be needed to cause the production to be among the most important in 
modern commerce.  In the United States the principal deposits are understood 
to be close to a station on a new railway—the Atlantic and Great Western—which 
will render their conveyance to New York comparatively inexpensive.  In Canada 
they are about twelve miles from the Wyoming Station of the Great Western of 
Canada Railway, and some arrangements will be necessary for the transit over 
that distance, the existing roads being of the worst description.  At the site 
of the principal wells the ground was two years ago covered by an almost 
unbroken forest.  Now there is a resident and constantly-increasing population 
of upwards of five hundred.  During the last winter the coaches took an average 
of fifty people daily to the spot from Wyoming, and many bought land and 
remained.  There are several inns filled to overflowing.  Two good hotels 
are in course of erection.  Houses and shanties are rising on all sides, and 
the greatest activity is everywhere apparent.  At present there are about one 
hundred wells in full operation, all yielding oil.  The land is held in large 
blocks, the owner leasing acres and half acres for ninety-nine years.  The 
terms usually are 300 dollars for the privilege and one-third of the oil 
drawn from the wells.  The wells are sunk and cribbed to a depth of from 40 
to 60 feet till the rock is reached.  In many cases surface-oil is found 
before reaching the rock, but it is of rather inferior quality and doubtful 
yield.  After arriving at the rock, the wells through the earth being from 4 
to 7 feet square, they drill to a depth of from 40 to 70 feet, between which 
distances oil is almost sure to be discovered.  Wooden tanks, varying from 
500 to 2000 gallons capacity, are constructed close to each well.  The oil 
is pumped into these, and afterwards drawn off into barrels to be sent to 
market.  A moderate average yield for all the wells now in operation (one 
hundred) is fifteen barrels or or 600 gallons per day.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>The most important movement of which we have received intelligence 
since our last is the departure of a naval expediton from Fortress Monroe, 
commanded by Commadore Stringham.  The squadron numbers 100 guns, and carries 
4000 men, commanded by General Butler.  The only avowed object of the 
expedition is to block up the inlets to the outer bar of the coast of North 
Carolina, and thus deprive privateers of their favourite places of refuge.  
But it is presumed that the unguarded Southern coast will be attacked at some 
point.  We shall soon hear where the blow has fallen.</p>

Summersville, in Nicholas county.  The 7th Ohio Regiment was surprised by a 
body of Confederates, and cut their way through with the loss of fifteen 
killed and forty wounded. A large number were scattered during the flight, 
and are missing.</p>
	  <p>In Missouri General Fremont has proclaimed martial law and 
emancipation to the slaves of Secessionist slaveholders.  The State rights 
men have captured 100,000 dollars at Lafayette, in this State.</p>
	  <p>Advices from Texas state that Fort Staunton has been abandoned 
and fired by the Union forces.</p>
	  <p>There is nothing new from the armies commanded by Generals 
M'Clellan and Banks respectively.</p>
	  <p>The Federal loss at Dug Spring, where General Lyon was killed, 
is officially announced as having been—killed, 223; wounded. 721; missing, 
291.  This out of a total of 5500 men engaged.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
	  <p>Two vessels had arrived at Matanzas, Cuba, from Charleston, 
having succeeded in running the blockade.</p>
	  <p>The Richmond papers complain that an opposition to Mr. Davis's 
Admininstration has been formed in the Confederate Congress; but, as all the 
proceedings of this body are done in secret session, we do not know what the 
platform of the Opposition is.</p>
	  <p>Governor Brown, of Georgia, has issued an address to the Georgians 
denouncing Mr. Davis's Administration for its centralising monarchical 
tendencies, and warning them to cherish the main principle of the Revolution 
of 1861—that of State rights and a weak central authority.</p>
	  <p>The<hi rend="italic">Vicksburg Whig</hi> advertises the 
manufacture of cotton-seed oil for burning, the blockade having deprived the 
Mississipians of material for light.</p>

<p rend="center">KENTUCKY.</p>
	  <p>President Lincoln has determined not to recognise the neutrality 
of Kentucky, but is willing to await the action of the State Legislature before 
forcing the State to declare its position.</p>
	  <p>The express companies are forbidden to carry letters to the 
Southern States through Kentucky.  Thus these States are now completely cut 
off from regular communication with the outer world.</p>

<p rend="center">ARMY NEWS.</p>
	  <p>Two hundred and sixty-one volunteer officers have resigned since 
the defeat at Bull Run.</p>
	  <p>Several solders claimed by Lord Lyons had been discharged from the 
army.</p>
	  <p>Not over half of the 25,000 additional volunteers called for by 
the recent proclamation of the Governor of New York have as yet enlisted.</p>
	  <p>The Philadelphia <title>Press</title> advertises a list of 400 names, signed by 
the Governor of the State, who had registered themselves as volunteers, but 
who afterwards refused to take the oath for three years' service.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
	  <p>The Union Defence Committee of New York have published a statement 
of the expenditure of 1,000,000 dols. placed at their disposal by the City 
Government.  531,709 dols. were expended in "aid to regiments;" 226,589 dols. 
in arms and ammunition, and 230,000 dols. in aid of the famlies of soldiers, 
leaving a small balance in their hands.</p>
	  <p>The revenue to be raised in the city of New York for municipal 
purposes only, for the present year, is 11,390,040 dols.</p>
	  <p>The mobbing of obnoxious peace papers continues.  The office of 
the New York <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> is protected by a large body of 
police.  But the Government refuses to allow it or any other journal of similar 
politics to go by post, while United States' marshals seize the bundles which 
are sent by private express companies.  Peace meetings are broken up by the 
Unionists; but in one instance, in Connecticut, the Unionist mob was beaten 
back by the partisans of peace.  The peace flag is a white one, and the war 
journals dub the movement "the showing of the white feather."</p>
	  <p>Captain T.F. Meagher has addressed a large meeting of Irishmen in 
New York, exhorting them to support the war and crush the revolution, because 
it was favoured by the English aristocracy.</p>

<p rend="center">GARIBALDI ON THE WAR.</p>
	  <p>A report having got abroad in both worlds that the Italian 
liberator was about to take service in the Federal Army, the Washington 
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Press</hi> contradicts it 
as follows:—</p>
	  <p>There is no truth in the reports that Garibaldi proposes to help 
us out of our troubles.  A gentleman here, personally acquainted with Garibaldi 
and his son, received a letter from the latter a few days ago, in which the son 
says he desired himself to come out and take part in the struggle now going on 
here for liberty, and that his father objected, on the ground that ours was a 
family quarrel, and could be settled more easily without foreign interference 
than with it, and that it was based upon a political question in which the 
nations were not interested, and in the settlement of which they could not 
become parties.  These are now the views and sentiments of Garibaldi as 
expressed by his son in private correspondence of very late date.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
	  <p>The subscriptions for the new National Loan at the Sub-Treasury 
in New York amount to 1,350,000 dollars, in amounts varying from 50
dollars to 10,000 dollars each.  This does not include the large
negotiations that have beeen going on between the banks and parties in
various parts of the country.  The notes are not yet ready for issue.
The New York <title>Tribune</title> is of opinion that Englishmen will
not be able to resist the temptation of 7.30 per cent interest.</p>

<p rend="center">TEXAN RANGERS (FEDERALISTS) RECONNOITRING.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scarcely</hi> anything more picturesque can be conceived 
than a troop of these rangers (as depicted on our first page) galloping wildly 
through the woody ravines of Virginia, between Alexandria and Fairfax, their 
carbines held ready for action at a moment's notice.  To see them rattling along,
 draped in their loose ponchos, their stern, bearded faces shadowed by the 
overlapping brims of their sombreros, one might almost fancy them a troop of 
Cromwellian cavalry in grim pursuit of Cavaliers.</p>

<p rend="center">KILLING BULLOCKS IN CAMP, VIRGINIA.</p>
	  <p>The regiments encamped at a distance from Commissariat Storehouse 
in the Federal camp get their fresh meat distributed to them alive, a bullock 
being unceremoniously turned into the canvas streets for them to slaughter, 
cut up, and prepare as they may think fit.  The fashion of dispatching the 
beast (as shown at page 271) is usually as follows:—Lassos are thrown over its 
horns and made fast, when three or four men on each side hang on with all their
 strength and steady the animal's head.  Some of the best shots in the regiment
 are then chosen, and one advances, takes deliberate aim at the forehead, and, 
if successful, the poor brute rolls over dead.  Should he, however, simply 
wound it, those who have hold of the ropes have a rough time of it, being 
dragged about the field until the animal is again secured, when another 
marksman steps forward, and generally finishes the work.</p>

<p rend="center">UNION TROOPS ATTACKING CONFEDERATE PRISONERS AT WASHINGTON.</p>
	  <p>There was a general impression among the disorganised Federalist 
soldiers after the battle of Bull Run that their wounded had been inhumanly 
treated by the Confederates.  Many cases of cruelty were narrated, with much 
circumstantiality, in the Unionist journals.  Some of them, it is to be 
feared, were but too true.  Among the first to feel the consequences of the 
anger aroused by the recital of these deeds of cold- blooded cruelty were 
some wretched prisoners paraded through Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, 
two days after the engagement.  It was with the greatest difficulty their 
guard defended them from the attacks of the demoralised Union men.  This 
incident is depicted on the preceding[sic] page.</p>

<p rend="center">ARREST OF MR. FAULKNER AT WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>On the return of Mr. Faulkner from his mission at Paris he went, as is 
the custom in such cases, to Washington, in order to report his arrival to 
the Executive.  While awaiting the settlement of certain formalities he took 
apartments at Brown's Hotel, and it was here he was arrested.  It appears 
that Mr. Faulkner, a Southern man, is imbued with Southern tendencies; and 
it is charged against him that during his period of office in France he 
encouraged the Secessionist agents in every possible way, and even went so 
far as to purchase arms from French manufacturers for the use of the 
Confederate States—endeavouring also to procure the recognition of the 
Southern Confederacy by the French Government.  Mr. Faulkner is now lodged 
in close confinement at the Provost Marshal's office; and it is reported 
that among the documents found with his effects papers of a treasonable 
character have been discovered.</p>

	  <p>That portion of the world's inhabitants among whom the English 
language is predominant has of late been indulging in a general census-taking.  
In the summer of last year the people of the United States summed up the 
goodly total of thirty-one millions and a half—a decennial increase of 35 per 
cent.  It was their last corporate feat.  No sooner were the numbers announced 
than the great Republic, unable to harmonise so large a family, fell 
asunder. . . .</p>
<pb n="288"/>

<p>In industrial pursuits the Irish emigrant of both sexes has thriven 
extraordinarily.  No European emigration has surpassed them in this respect, 
except the German, and that only because of the great skill both in 
agriculture and manufactures which the latter possess, and which the Irish 
lacked.  The greatest dry-goods merchant in America is a native of Ireland.  
The women seem to have succeeded even better than the men.  The immense sums 
transmitted to their relatives in Ireland  by the servant women have attested 
the strong domestic affections and the large savings of Irishwomen abroad.  
In the matter of education the young family of the emigrant has been taught 
at free unsectarian schools the elementary branches of knowledge.  On leaving 
school his children have enjoyed every facility for the acquisition of trades.  
Political power has been his in a measure greater than he has known how to use 
wisely.  What American or colonial politician does not either dread, or 
conciliate, or swear by "the Irish vote"?  If the German emigrant is slightly 
superior in the industrial career, in politics he is a cipher by the side of 
the Irishman.  Australian and Canadian premiers, Californian and Jamaican 
governors, American senators, spring directly from the ranks of the Hibernian 
emigration.  Two United States' Presidents (Jackson and Buchanan), and more 
than one judge of the Supreme Court, were the sons of Irish cottiers.  To 
shed tears over the fate of the population that has vanished from Ireland is 
evidently to throw away one's sympathy on objects who do not need it.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>The naval expedition under the command of Commodore Stringham and 
General Butler fell upon the forts which commanded Hatteras Inlet, on the 
coast of North Carolina.  The attack commenced on the morning of the 28th 
ult.; 300 Federals, covered by the gun-boats, were landed through a heavy surf.
  All the boats were bilged in the surf, and no more men could be thrown 
ashore.  Two frigates, the Minnesota and Wabash, commenced shelling one of 
the batteries.  The shot from the battery fell short.  In three hours the 
Confederates evacuated the battery, and it was occupied by the 300 United 
States' troops on shore.  On the next day Fort Hatteras was attacked.  At 
five minutes past eleven a.m., an 11-inch shell having pierced the bomb-proof 
through a ventilator and exploded inside near the magazine, the enemy gave up 
the fight, and raised a white flag.  General Butler demanded an unconditional 
surrender.  The Confederates were commanded by Commodore Barron, late of the 
United States' Navy, and more recently Assistant-Secretary of the Confederate 
Navy.  After some demur the force, consisting of 45 officers and 665 
non-commissioned officers and privates, surrendered, and have been taken to 
New York.  Their loss was 8 killed and 35 wounded.  On the Federal side 
nobody was hurt.  In the forts were captured 25 pieces of artillery, 1000 
stand of arms, a large quantity of ordnance stores, provisions; three vessels 
laden with cotton and tobacco, and about to run the blockade; and four stands 
of colours.  It is observed that the articles of capitulation are signed by S. 
Barron, "Flag Officer Confederate States' Navy, Commanding Naval Defences, 
Virginia and North Carolina," and by Wm. F. Martin, "Colonel 7th Regiment 
Infantry, North Carolina Volunteers."  The fort was occupied by Federal troops 
commanded by Colonel Max Weber, and General Butler forthwith returned to 
Washington, where he  received an ovation, and made a speech to the crowd 
extolling the deeds of the Navy.</p>
	  <p>The Confederates have since abandoned their fortifications at 
Ocracoke Inlet, also on the coast of North Carolina, a little to the south of 
Hatteras Inlet.  They carried away their guns.</p>
	  <p>Multitudes of North Carolinians were coming in to Fort Hatteras 
to take the oath of allegiance.  Between two and three hundred had done so in 
a day.</p>
	  <p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Enquirer</hi> of the 20th ult. 
publishes a letter from Fernandina, Florida, which states that the crew of 
the celebrated privateer Jeff. Davis had arrived there—the vessel having 
been wrecked on the bar while trying to get into St. Augustine.</p>
	  <p>Major-General Fremont, commanding the army of the West, has 
issued an important proclamation from St. Louis.  He declares martial law 
throughout the State of Missouri.  The lines of the army of occupation are 
for the present declared to extend from Leavenworth, Kansas, by way of the 
posts of Jefferson City, Rolla, and Ironton, to Cape Girardeau, on the 
Mississippi River.  This includes about three-fourths of the area of the State.
  "All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines 
shall be tried by court-martial, and, if found guilty, will be shot.  The 
property, real and personal, of all persons in the State of Missouri who 
shall take up arms against the United States, or who shall be directly 
proven to have taken active part with their enemies in the field, is 
declared to be confiscated to the public use, <hi rend="italic">and their 
slaves, if any they have, are hereby declared free men.</hi>"</p>
	  <p>A short telegram to Farther Point announces that Paducah, 
Kentucky, had been occupied by the Federalists, thus violating that 
neutral position which the Kentuckians have striven to maintain against 
both sections of the late United States.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>A report had been in circulation at the North and in Kentucky that President 
Davis died in Richmond, of a congestive fever, on the 2nd inst.  It is 
indicative of the absolute ignorance at the North of what passes in the South 
that by the 7th the report had neither been confirmed nor contradicted.  In 
the mean time it is certain that Mr. Davis has long been ailing, and that he 
had a constitution already weakened by disease.  Mr. Russell, in his last 
letter to the <title>Times</title>, speaks thus of him:—"When I last saw Mr. Davis he was 
recovering from an attack of tic douloureux, to which he is subject, and its 
agonies have been so great that he has lost the sight of one eye, I was 
assured, in consequence.  He is a slight, spare man, who did not appear to 
me capable of resisting violent desease."  If the report be true, 
Vice-President Stephens, of Georgia, will occupy the post of honour and of 
danger.  When last heard of, the Vice-President also was sick at Manassas, 
and he is still sparer and slighter than Mr. Davis.</p>
	  <p>East Tennessee is now co-operating with the Confederates, 
Knoxville, the capital, turning out some fine battalions of cavalry.</p>
	  <p>An Alabama newspaper recommends the planters to give the negroes 
more molosses and rice and less bacon.  This plan would diminish the 
consumption of bacon two millions and a quarter of pounds weekly in the 
Southern Confederacy.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NATIONAL LOAN.</p>
	  <p>The New York papers publish glowing accounts of the way in 
which the public are coming forward and taking the 7 3-10ths per cent loan.  
Nevertheless, the aggregate subscriptions by the public (apart from the banks) 
are as yet only about 2,000,000 dollars.  Under these circumstances Secretary 
Chase has found it necessary to issue an appeal to the people of the United 
States in behalf of this investment.  The most interesting passages of this 
appeal are as follows:—</p>
	  <p>The real and personal values in the United States reach the vast 
aggregate of 16,000,000,000 dollars, and in the States now loyal to the Union 
this aggregate is 11,000,000,000 dollars.  The yearly surplus earnings of 
the loyal people are estimated by intelligent persons well conversant with 
such investigations at more than 400,000,000 dollars, while the well-considered 
judgment of military men of the highest rank and repute warrant the 
confident expectation that if the war is prosecuted with energy, courage, 
and skill it may be brought to a conclusion before the close of the ensuing 
spring, in which event the cost beyond the revenue will hardly exceed the 
amount of the 250,000,000 dollars loan authorised by Congress, and with a 
due economy in all branches of the public service not more than the total 
expenditures of Great Britain or France in years of peace.  And it is not 
unreasonable to hope that the auspicious result of peace may be hastened 
by the reflection of the citizens of the States in insurrection—that they 
will review their action, weigh their own welfare, consider the disposition 
of the people of the whole country to recognise all their constitutional 
rights, and to allow them their full share in the benefits of the common 
Government, and renew their allegiance to the Union which in an evil hour 
they have been tempted to throw off?</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
	  <p>The Surveyor at New York has seized some forty vessels in New 
York harbour, under the confiscation law, which are said to be owned at the 
South.  Similar seizures have taken place at Boston and Philadelphia.</p>

with fitting out slavers from New York.</p>

chiefly of Germans, who settle on farms in the West, and are comparatively 
unhurt by the civil war.  The Irish, who throng the cities, feel the effect 
of hard times more acutely, and send home discouraging accounts, which 
diminish the immigration.</p>
	  <p>It having been discovered that vessels loaded with provisions 
and stores of all sorts were clearing for Metamoras, a port of Mexico 
bordering on Texas, the cargoes of which were doubtless intended for the 
enemy's use, all clearances for that port have been refused by the 
authorities of the seaports.</p>
	  <p>The Northern journals continue their "frantic abuse," as a 
Boston paper calls it, of Mr. Russell.  The leading journals deny that 
Fremont's proclamation in Missouri makes the war one of emancipation, and 
stigmatise the idea as criminal.  As recruits are not coming in quick enough, 
the people are warned that resort will be had, if necessary, to conscription.
Prince Napoleon and suite have been travelling in Wisconsin.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>
	  <p>A San Francisco correspondent says:—</p>
	  <p>The war has not yet done any serious damage to business generally 
in California.  The general feeling here is one of pecuniary prosperity.  
Labour is as high and as much in demand as at this time last year.  San 
Francisco is improving with great rapidity.  At no time in past years were 
so many fine buildings going up together in Montgomery-street, the Broadway 
of the Pacific.</p>
	  <p>The remains of T.B. M'Manus, the late Irish exile, were shipped
 from San Francisco on the 21st ult., for Ireland, by way of New York.  They 
were escorted to the dock by a procession of Irishmen.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">From</hi> each succeeding week's news we gather that 
the struggle in the States is assuming more and more steadily the aspect of a 
real war, to be carried on according to the known rules, and in all respects 
after the fashion, of the Old-World contests.  The singular mlange 
of vainglorious boastings and lamentable shortcomings, of military tailoring, 
scandalous jobs, female influence, and incompetent officering, is gradually 
dying out before the stern exigencies of the occasion.  The first 
well-organised expedition under this new rgime has proved entirely 
successful; and, though the overwhelming amount of force employed may detract 
a little from the honour and glory of the encounter, yet the importance of the 
position may fully compensate for any deficiency on that head.  The 
Northerners have established themselves in command of the extensive system 
of gulfs and creeks which lie immediately behind the easternmost point of 
the Southern States, and which have hitherto supplied at once protection 
and a vast natural harbour for privateers, and they have thus at once struck 
a heavy blow at this questionable system of sea robbery and at the same time 
secured an important outpost in the enemy's country.  In all probability a 
similarly well-planned expedition is at this moment sweeping down the 
Mississippi, and which, if successful, will have the effect, in conjunction 
with the blockade and the attitude of the Federal troops along the Northern 
border, of surrounding and isolating the whole eastern portion of the 
Seceding States.  We suppose, by-the-way, no sane man in this country ever 
believed that in the present aspect of Italian affairs Garibaldi would for 
a moment dream of putting the Atlantic between himself and the Mediterranean 
at present.  His refusal is now formally announced.  The Southerners  appear 
to have made a decided move in the direction of English interference:  the 
quasi proclamation of an intention to store the whole cotton crop and issue 
State Bonds against it can have no other meaning than to invite, or rather 
compel, us in behalf of Manchester, to break the blockade.  The step is only 
another proof of how little our Transatlantic cousins understand our temper. 
 We shall do nothing of the sort; we can buy and grow cotton elsewhere, 
though we admit that at present there is a doubt as to quality.  But we are 
not going to war for Manchester, much as we desire to see it prosperous; 
and this naturally brings up a regret at the somewhat gloomy aspect of 
commercial affairs in Lancashire and elsewhere.</p>

the prisoner armed with a chain wrenched from the wall of his cell, with

surrendering for an hour's life, a good dinner, and a drink of whisky;

<p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">Short</hi> time since the United States' sloop 
Resolute, while cruising along the Virginia shore of the Potomac, detached 
a boat to take possession of a scow that lay hard and fast in the mud, laden 
with barrels, supposed by the commander to contain powder for the use of the 
Disunionists.  Just as the bowsman was preparing to hold on with the boathook 
a murderous fire was opened from behind the bushes on the bank, killing and 
wounding all but one at the first discharge.  It was nothing more than a ruse 
to draw Federalists on, and it succeeded too well.  With great difficulty the 
boat was got out of range by those able to seize the oars, and shortly 
afterwards the Resolute came up and shelled the woods, but with what execution 
it is impossible to say.</p>

<p rend="center">PRINCE GORTSCHAKOFF'S LETTER.</p>

	  <p>On the 7th inst. Baron de Stoeckl, Russian Ambassador at 
Washington, had an audience with the President to deliver the following 
despatch from the Russian Chancery:-</p>
	  <p>M. de Stoeckl, &amp;c.		ST. PETERSBURG, July 10.
<q>Sir,-From the beginning of the conflict which 
divides the United States of America you have been desired to make known to 
the Federal Government the deep interest with which our August Master was 
obseving the development of a crisis which puts in question the prosperity 
and even the existence of the Union.</q></p>
	  <p>The Emperor profoundly regrets to see that the hope of a peaceful 
solution is not realised, and that American citizens, already in arms, are 
ready to let loose upon their country the most formidable of the scourges of 
polical society-a civil war.  For more than the eighty years that it has 
existed the American Union owes its independence, its towering rise, and its 
progress, to the concord of its members, consecrated under the auspices of 
its illustrious founder, by institutions which have been able to reconcile 
the Union with liberty.  The Union has been faithful.  It has exhibited to 
the world the spectacle of a prosperity without example in the annals of 
history.  It would be deplorable that, after so conclusive an experience, 
the United States should be hurried into a breach of the solemn compact 
which, up to this time, has made their power.  In spite of the diversity 
of their constitutions and of their interests, and perhaps even because of 
their diversity, Providence seems to urge them to draw closer the traditional 
bond which is the basis of the very condition of their political existence.  
In any event, the sacrifices which they might impose upon themselves to 
maintain it are beyond comparison with those which dissolution would bring 
after it.  United, they perfect themselves; isolated, they are paralysed.</p>
	  <p>The struggle which unhappily has just arisen can neither be 
indefinitely prolonged nor lead to the total destruction of one of the parties.
  Sooner or later, it will be necessary to come to some settlement, whatsoever 
it may be, which may cause the divergent interests now actually in conflict to
 coexist.  The American nation would, then, give proof of high political 
wisdom in seeking in common such a settlement before a useless effusion of 
blood, a barren squandering of strength and of public riches, and acts of 
violence and reciprocal reprisals, shall have come to deepen an abyss between 
the two parties of the Confederation, to end definitively in their mutual 
exhaustion and in the ruin—perhaps irreparable—of their commercial and 
political power.</p>
	  <p>Our August Master cannot resign himself to admit such deplorable 
anticipations.  His Imperial Majesty still places his confidence in that 
practical good sense of the citizens of the Union who appreciate so 
judiciously their true interests.  His Majesty is happy to believe that 
the members of the Federal Government, and the infuential men of the two 
parties, will seize all occasions and will unite all their efforts to calm 
the effervescence of the passions.  There are no interests so divergent that 
it may not be possible to reconcile them by labouring to that end with zeal 
and perseverance, in a spirit of justice and moderation.</p>
	  <p>If, within the limits of your friendly relations, your language 
and your counsels may contribute to this result, you will respond, Sir, to 
the intentions of his Majesty the Emperor in devoting to this the personal 
influence which you may have been able to acquire during your long residence 
at Washington, and the consideration which belongs to your character as the 
representative of a Sovereign animated by the most friendly sentiments towards 
the American Union.  This Union is not simply in our eyes an element 
essential to the universal political equilibrium; it constitutes, besides, 
a nation to which our August Master and all Russia have pledged the most 
friendly interests, for the two countries, placed at the extremities of 
the two worlds, both in the ascending period of their development, appear 
called to a natural community of interests and of sympathies, of which they 
have already given mutual proofs to each other.</p>
	  <p>I do not wish here to approach any of the questions which divide 
the United States.  We are not called upon to express ourselves in this contest.
  The preceding considerations have no other object than to attest the lively 
solicitude of the Emperor in the presence of the dangers which menace the 
American Union, and the sincere wishes that his Majesty enterains for the 
maintenance of that great work, so laboriously raised, and which appeared 
so rich in its future.</p>
	  <p>It is in this sense, Sir, that I desire you to express yourself, 
as well to the members of the general Government, as to the influential 
persons whom you may meet, giving them the assurance that in every event the 
American nation may count upon the most cordial sympathy on the part of our 
August Master during the important crisis which it is passing through at 
present.</p>
	  <p>Receive, Sir, the expression of my very deep consideration.</p>
<p rend="right">GORTSCHAKOFF.</p>
	  <p>Mr. Seward wrote a short and courteous reply expressing his 
profound sense of the "liberal, friendly, and magnanimous sentiments" of the 
Emperor, and regarding them "as a new guaranty of a friendship between the two 
countries which had its beginning with the national existence of the United 
States."</p>

<p rend="center">A DREADFUL RAILROAD CATASTROPHIE.</p>
	  <p>A railway-bridge over the Platte River, on the Hannibal and St. 
Joseph Line, Missouri, broke down under the weight of a passenger train, 
containing nearly 100 men, women, and children.  The cars were precipitated 
into the river.  Seventeen persons were instantly killed, and many others 
horribly mangled.  Only three were able to call for assistance.  It appears 
that the timber supports of the bridge had been nearly burnt through and the 
fire then extinguished, thus leaving no suspicious appearance about the 
structure.  It was subsequently discovered that some other bridges on the route 
to St. Joseph were similarly disabled, and the track obstructed by logs.  It is 
supposed to be the work of Missouri Secessionists.</p>

has been very feeble, being afflicted with four abscesses and a continual 
derangement of the liver, which gives him a consumptive appearance, though 
his lungs are sound.  He has never weighed over 96lb.  His figure is 
attenuated, his shoulders contracted, and his limbs slender.  When speaking, 
he has at first a shrill, sharp voice, which assumes a more sonorous character 
as he progresses.  His remarks are witty, rhetorical, and solid, with a dash 
of satire.  He was elected to the position of Vice-President (of the Southern 
Confederacy) on the same day with Jefferson Davis—viz. the 9th of February 
last."</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> wisdom of the policy which has 
prompted both our own and the French Government to adhere strictly to a line 
of non-interference in reference to the American struggle has received a 
remarkable confirmation in the reception given to the Emperor of Russia's 
well-meant recommendation.  The excellence of the intention is fully and 
readily recognised, but, for all practical purposes, the letter has received 
very much the same treatment at the hands of the Northern public as that 
usually assigned to intermeddlers in conjugal differences.  We believe the 
secret of the general non-interfering policy of the European Powers to lie 
in the tacit admission by all the leading statesmen—including our own—that we 
do not, in truth and fact, understand or appreicate in any adequate measure 
the real points at issue.  Meanwhile our Transatlantic brethern seem to us to 
ask, and very reasonably, nothing whatever but to be allowed to settle their 
own differences in their own way.  The future is emphatically <hi rend="italic">
in nubibus</hi>.  Whether, in the event of victory proclaiming for the North, 
a re-union effected by coercion can have in it any element of lasting; 
whether any coercion can compel recalcitrant States to send members to 
Congress; and whether, above all, the proclamation of freedom to the black 
population of the south be anything more than a mere military manoeuvre;
—these, and a hundred other questions of almost equal import, have their 
solution still in the womb of Time.  This is notably a matter in reference 
to which we must be pardoned if we place no faith in the prophets.</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Frilling</hi>.—There appeared a few months back in different literary periodicals 
some curious particulars of the capabilities of the sewing-machine, an 
invention which is now so extensively employed in the world of industrial 
production.  We were told that amongst its multifarious applications this 
machine had been employed not only to sew garments of every kind, but every 
form of thick leather, the most delicate fabrics of the loom, the finest 
laces, ships' sails, and paper; even hose for draining the mines of 
California had passed under its operation.  One of its applications, 
however, was not mentioned, and this is of a kind that will especially 
attract the attention of the ladies.  A contrivance has been recently 
invented of a very simple character, which, when combined with an ordinary 
sewing-machine, will produce by their joint action a beautifully-regular 
frill.  This frill can be either firmly sewed separately or at once attached 
to a plain band or to some part of a dress.  By the expression "firmly sewed" 
we mean a frill which cannot be drawn up and down the thread, but one of 
which every plait or gather is tightly held and secured.  The neatness of the 
work is very pleasing to the eye; and the plain band frill can be produced 
very cheaply.  It will probably shortly be for sale in every draper's shop in 
the empire.  We have lately seen some frill-making machines at work, and 
observed the rapidity and regularity with which the article can be produced.  
The invention is, we believe, of American origin.  This is something beyond a 
labour-saving machine, since no similar article of manufacture has before been
 brought into the market.  Hence it has been made the subject of patent.  
All the processes are conducted by girls, and another source of employment 
is furnished to our female population.</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Canadian steamer North Briton brings 
New York journals to the 19th and telegrams to the 21st ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
	  <p>The only fighting of importance has taken place in Western 
Missouri, at a town called Lexington, on the south bank of the Missouri River.
  General Price, of the States' rights party, commenced the attack on the 
Federal intrenchments at Lexington, defended by Colonel Mulligan's command, 
on the 16th ult.  The fight lasted all day, and ended in the repulse of the 
assailants.  The loss of the "rebels" is set down by the Northerners at 4000.  
On the 17th and 18th the attack was renewed.  On the last occasion the "rebels"
 were scattered by a bayonet charge of the Irish Brigade.  The attack was to 
be renewed on the following day.  Meanwhile the Federals had been reinforced by 
4000 men, and other reinforcements were rapidly approaching.  In the same State,
 at Blue Mills Landing, 600 Confederates have been routed by 1500 Federals.</p> 
	  <p>    The hitherto neutral State of Kentucky is now occupied by both
 Federal and Confederate troops, but no engagement had yet taken place between 
them.  The Kentucky Legislature, by vote of 71 to 26, has requested the 
Confederates to withdraw from the soil of the State; but the Confederate 
General replies that the possession of the pass in the Cumberland mountains 
is necessary for the safety of his position, and he cannot withdraw while the 
Federal troops are permitted to remain.</p>
	  <p>It is announced that preparations for two important movements 
against the Southern coast are going rapidly forward, so that the expeditions 
will be ready to set sail within a very few weeks. In one of them the land 
forces will be commanded by General Butler, and in the other by General Sherman.
  The number of troops employed in the two expeditions will be 25,000 men, 
with naval forces of proportionate strength.  The particular points to be 
attacked are kept secret.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>
	  <p>   Four British vessels have been captured coming into Hatteras 
Inlet laden with stores from Halifax, Nova Scotia.</p>
	  <p>   The Captain-General of Cuba has issued a proclamation 
declaring that vessels sailing under the Confederate flag and engaged in 
legitimate trade will be admitted into Cuban ports on equal terms with all 
other vessels.</p>
	  <p>   The British Government will be allowed to communicate with 
their Consuls in seceded ports by means of ships of war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
	  <p>General Beauregard's report of the engagement of July 18 
(preceding that of Bull Run) has only just been published.  It is very 
long compared with the insignificant proportions of the skirmish.  He admits 
that he was "opportunely informed of the determination of the enemy to 
advance on Manassas;" he terms the battle an "artillery duel;" states the 
losses on his side at 15 killed and 73 wounded, and that he took 20 prisoners, 
175 stand of arms, a large quantity of accoutrements and blankets, and 150 hats.
  The delay in the preparation of the report is owing to his "engrossing 
administrative duties."</p>
<p>The cotton and tobacco crops have been much damaged by heavy rains.  
The new crop of cotton would reach, it was estimated, 3,000,000 bales.  In 
1859-60 it was 4,600,000 bales.</p>
	  <p>The New Orleans banks have suspended cash payments.</p>
	  <p>Colonel John A. Washington, the nearest living relative of the 
Father of his Country, and the proprietor of the Mount Vernon estate, has been 
killed by a Federal picket, near Elkwater, in Western Virginia.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL FREMONT'S PROCLAMATION RESCINDED.</p>
	  <p>   The most important political news of the week under review is 
the rescinding of the slave emancipation clause of General Fremont's 

proclamation.  The letter of President Lincoln is as follows: —</p> 
<p rend="right">WASHINGTON, Sept. 11.</p>
	  <p>	Major-General John C. Fremont.</p>
	  <p>Sir,-Yours of the 8th, in answer to mine of the 2nd inst., has 
been just received.  Assuming  that you upon the ground could better judge 
of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance, on seeing 
your proclamation of Aug. 30, I perceived no general objection to it; the 
particular objectionable clause, however, in relation to the confiscation 
of property and the liberation of slaves, appears to me to be objectionable 
in its non-conformity to the Act of Congress passed the 6th of last August 
upon the same subjects, and hence I wrote you expressing my wish that that 
clause should be modified accordingly.  Your answer, just received, expresses 
the preference on your part that I should make an open order for the
 modification, which I cheerfully do.  It is, therefore, ordered that the 
said clause of said proclamation be so modified, held, and construed, as 
to conform with and not to transcend the provisions on the same subject 
contained in the Act of Congress, entitled "An Act to confiscate property 
used for insurrectionary purposes, approved Aug. 5, 1861," and that said Act 
be published at length with this order.</p>
<p rend="right">Your obedient servant,	A. Lincoln.</p>

	  <p>Several Republican papers in the West comment severely on this 
act of Mr. Lincoln; but in the East the organs of public opinion seem to 
acquiesce in the wisdom of the course taken.  Mr. Lincoln was influenced 
in this direction by a desire to retain his hold on the loyal population 
in the adhering and seceded Slave States.</p>

<p rend="center">TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS.</p>
	  <p>Three startling catastrophes are reported.  On the night of the 
17th ult. a railroad bridge (10ft. high, with a span of 60ft.) on the Ohio 
and Mississippi Railway, in Southern Indiana, gave way under a train of cars 
containing a portion of the 19th Illinois Volunteers, and precipitated nearly 
the whole of the cars into the bed of the creek.  About 50 soldiers were 
killed and 100 wounded.  It is believed that Confederate sympathisers had 
tampered with the bridge, a large proportion of the inhabitants of Southern 
Indiana being emigrants from the South.</p>
	  <p>A steam-boat explosion occurred on the Sacramento River, 
California, on the 25th of August.  The J.A. M'Clelland exploded, killing 
fifteen of the passengers certainly, and probably many more.  Twelve were 
scalded, some of whom had since died.</p>
	  <p>At the Continental Theatre, Philadelphia, several ballet-girls 
were burnt to death on the 14th.  As the girls were dressing for a ballet 
introduced into the representation of "The Tempest," one of them, named Gale, 
while in the act of getting down her dress, was set on fire by the flame of a 
gas jet.  One of her sisters endeavoured to extinguish the flames, but in the 
effort her own clothes were ignited.  A third sister ran to the rescue with a 
like result.  In a frantic state they rushed into an adjoining room filled 
with ballet-girls, whose gauze also caught fire.  In their terror some of 
them leaped from the windows into the street. All of them were more or less 
severely burnt, and the result was that six of them died within a few hours 
after the occurrence, and four more were not expected to survive.  All the 
principal theatres of Philadelphia had given benefits for the families of the 
victims.  The Gales were Englishwomen.</p>

<p rend="center">COMMISSIONERS TO THE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION.</p>
	  <p>The President has appointed the following gentlemen to represent 
the interests of the American exhibitors in the World's Fair of 1862—namely, 
W.H. Seward, Secretary of State; Caleb Smith, Secretary of the Interior; 
Edward Everett, of Massachusetts; Professor Henry, of the Smithsonian 
Institution; Robert B. Minturn, of New York; J.D. Coleman, of Pennsylvania; 
J.H. Kliphart, of Ohio; J.K. Partridge, of Maryland; B.P. Jonson, of New York;
 Richard Wallach, Mayor of Washington; W.W. Seaton, of Washington; and J.C.G. 
Kennedy, Superintendent of the Census Bureau.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
	  <p>The national loan is being taken at the rate of 700,000 dollars 
per diem in New York, and in smaller amounts in Philadelphia, Boston, Troy, 
and Pittsburg.</p>
	  <p>Exchange on England has risen to 109, a rate higher than it has 
ruled since the commencement of the revolution.  The Baltimore banks are 
forwarding their Southern deposits to England for fear of confiscation.</p>
	  <p>The Treasury demand-notes are being eagerly taken up in the 
West <pb n="337"/> supplying to the people, for the first time since the 

national bank was suppressed, a really national currency.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
	  <p>The <hi rend="italic">New Hampshire Gazette</hi>, a journal 105 
years of age, has suspended in consequence of the hard times.</p>
	  <p>The Russian Prince Salm-Salm and Major J.F. De Courcey, a British 
officer who held a commission in the Turkish Contingent during the Crimean War,
 have accepted commands in the Federal Army.  Colonel Rankin, M.P., of Canada, 
has offered to raise a regiment of lancers for the same cause in Canada.  This 
offer has been accepted.  The regiment is nominally to be deemed a Michigan 
regiment.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon had returned from his Western and Canadian tour 
to New York.</p>

	  <p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuter's office 
yesterday (Friday):—</p>
	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">America</hi>.—New York, Sept. 24.—Lexington, 
Missouri, has capitulated to the Confederate forces.  The Comte de Paris and 
the Duc de Chartres have been appointed officers in the Federal army.  The 
steamers City of New York and Jura have arrived out.  The Saxonia and Persia 
have been intercepted off Cape Race.</p>
	  <p>The following intelligence has been received direct from the 
Southern States.  The cotton loan to the Federal Government amounted to 
1,000,000 bales on the 6th of September.  On that day, the day President 
Davis was reported to have died, he was at his office at Richmond attending 
to his official duties.  The news is confirmed that the authorities of Spain 
in Cuba have issued an order to have the same protection extended to vessels 
sailing under the Confederate flag that is enjoyed by the flags of other 
countries.  At Richmond the estimated loss of the enemy at Manassas is 15,000 
in killed, wounded, and prisoners.  M'Clennan is closely hemmed in between 
the lines of Beauregard and Johnson and the Potomac.  No importance whatever 
was attached to the loss of Hatteras.  The press in the South is at liberty 
to discuss public matters freely.  The cotton-picking season had fully 
commenced, and the planters were storing their crops away in the seed on the 
estates, there to remain at the disposal of Government until the raising of 
the blockade.</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> of the most important strongholds 
in Virginia is the peninsula between the York and James Rivers, on which are 
Williamsburg, the ancient capital of Virginia; Jamestown, where was the first 
English settlement; and Yorktown—these three localities being still in the 
possession of the Virginians, and strongly fortified; while the extremity of 
the peninsula is occupied by the Federalists, together with the fortress 
(Monroe) at the point.  Independently of its importance in the present war, 
the old city of Yorktown is full of interest both to the antiquarian and 
lover of the picturesque.</p>
	  <p>Originally Virginia was divided into only eight counties, of 
which York was one, Yorktown having been made the capital in 1705.  The 
counties have been gradually added to and subdivided subsequently, in 
proportion to the increase of population and extension of the settlements 
west of the mountains, there now being upwards of one hundred and fifty.</p>
	  <p>During the early history of Virginia, Yorktown was a place of
 much commercial importance, and there are again anticipations of a 
magnificent future for this dilapidated and desolated village.  For many 
years it has been only an unimportant fishing town, having remained in its 
original condition and retained its old associations: only two buildings 
have been erected since the revolutionary war.  The old church, built 170 
years ago, was burned down in 1814, a "frame" edifice having since replaced it. 
 The churchyard, like those of several other early settlements, bears quite an 
English appearance.  Old family tombstones, with broad slabs and carved 
inscriptions, lie broken and half buried in weeds and rubbish.</p>
<p>The Swan Tavern, still standing, and now crowded with soldiers, is said 
to be the oldest in Virginia; but the building exciting the largest share of 
interest is the old Nelson Mansion (from which our View was taken), the family 
residence of the Nelsons, who emigrated from Cumberland, occupied a high 
standing in the county of York, and were the "ancestors of all the Nelsons" 
in Virginia.  During the revolutionary war, when this place was occupied by 
the English, and bombarded by the allied armies of France and America, Lord 
Cornwallis made the Nelson House his headquarters until one day, whilst his 
Lordship was at dinner, his favourite servant in attendance was shot by a 
cannon-ball which entered through the wall.  After this unwelcome visitor 
Cornwallis removed his quarters to a less prominent abode.</p>

	  <p>Two or three months ago the quiet and unoffending citizens of 
Yorktown were pursuing their peaceful avocations when a couple of 
war-steamers appeared off the shore, and several cannon balls came flying 
through the air, without, however, doing any other injury than to the nerves 
of the women and children, who forthwith "packed up" and departed for safer 
localities, while the men took immediate precautions to defend the place, 
which is now one vast military encampment.  There is a long line of camps 
on the ridge of the high river banks, another in an open space of the woods 
beyond, and a third is down on the shore; behind you, around you, which ever 
way you turn, the pointed tents dart up in bright relief before the broad 
river and blue line of distant coast, or lie snugly embedded in the dark 
green woods; and from one or another of these encampments one's ears are 
perpetually assailed by the drum and the fife, which comprise the principal 
military music of Yorktown.  The Southern stock of band instruments is 
nearly exhausted, so the fife rings changes on the martial airs of "Dixie 
Land" and the "Marseillaise," varied by Irish jigs; and the drum beats time 
to the march or parade.  Round the corner of an old building pour forth a 
company of soldiers in "undress"—very "undress"—costume, looking like a troop 
of navvies, though one-half may be men of fortune and position, who at home 
command their hundred servants and their carriages and horses, but here 
willingly, eagerly, shoulder their axe, and sally forth at dawn of day to 
throw up breastworks and erect batteries.</p>
	  <p>Across that field march a company to drill, along that road 
goes another; there a patrol of Zouaves are keeping guard before the 
head-quarters of the General, which is an old, dilapidated building of 
revolutionary times.  Here comes a troop of horses, then a line of baggage-waggons of crazy form and uncertain motion; yonder is a train of a hundred 
mules.  The old town is alive with bustle, the whole scene is bewildering.  
It is not English in spite of the antique buildings, which are at variance 
with the character of the foliage, the bright sky, and glaring sun.  The 
river reminds one of the Exe below Powderham, without its background of 
Haldon and Warborough.  It is dotted with little butterfly fishing-boats, 
which, peacefully gliding here and there, add another contradiction to this 
scene of warlike preparations, and with a telescope you may even see the 
malicious Pawnee cruising about the mouth of the river, some fifteen miles 
off, not daring, however, to come within gunshot.  The scene is not American, 
with those dull, dingy, old dwellings, in place of the gaily-painted, fanciful 
little eggshell residences of modern America.  The groups of loungers are 
perfectly American though, entirely at ease and at home, whether perched upon 
fences, sitting on doorsteps, or lounging under the trees.  But along come a 
company of Zouaves, and the American associations are wafted to Algeria or 
the Crimera, which are again destroyed by the most unoriental scenery, and 
the negro women in Eastern turbans and very Western crinolines.  It is a 
scene of itself, of the times and the occasion, a scene in this second great 
American revolution, which will take its place in the world's history as far 
different in its complication of causes and results as is the scene above 
descibed.</p>
	  <p>The whole scenery of Yorktown is picturesque, even in its present 
most desolate and rugged condition. The foliage of locust and linden trees is 
everywhere beautiful—the tramp of soldiers cannot affect that—and there is a 
sad poetry in the luxuriance of the vines and wild flowers which spring up 
in every corner, the broken fences and the trampled gardens smiling again 
under the magnificence of the gaudy trumpet-flower, and every heap of rubbish 
covered with the delicate passion-flower.  The embankments freshly thrown up 
are soon green with vegetation, and a few minutes' walk will take you into 
woods where war and strife seem but a dream or a history of the past.  From 
wooded banks deep ravines and romantic roads wind down to the shore, which, 
covered with fine sand, is washed by a few semi-saline waves and marine plants.

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> no doubt savours of cowardice to 
indulge in any sort of exultation at the difficulties of a rival; but it is 
indeed difficult to peruse the file of American journals brought over by each 
successive mail without something like a quiet chuckle at the singular 
admissions which are gradually and most reluctantly forced out.  Blessed 
ourselves with a really free and constitutional Government, a responsible 
Ministry, an unfettered press, and tribunals of unquestionable integrity, it 
has been difficult—perhaps we ought rather to say unpalatable—to our 
imaginations to picture the actual condition of internal affairs on the other 
side of the Atlantic which has contributed so largely to bring about the 
present struggle, and promises fair to make its final solution a work of such 
time and difficulty.  The serious hindrances presented by the want of a 
standing army and an adequate navy, formidable as they are, appear to us as 
nothing compared with the entire absence of actual freedom of thought and 
action involved in such proceedings as the torture of independent editors, an 
exercise of female influence rivalling the worst features of the Court of 
Louis XIV., and a consequent thrusting into responsible positions of men of 
no real competency whatever.  It is impossible at the same time not to 
connect this chronic disorder of the most exalted functions of American 
administration with the tone at once so unfairly and so persistently indulged 
in in reference to the attitude and intentions of this country.  When will our 
Transatlantic kinsmen—as well as French Colonels and M. Dupin—begin to
 understand that war is the very last thing an Englishman thirsts for?  It 
is forced upon us undoubtedly from time to time, and we accept it as a 
necessity, and so meet and subdue it; but we recognise it all the while as 
an odious necessity, involving an expenditure of human lives which we would 
fain spare, a waste of national treasure which we can ill afford, and an 
interruption to commerce which strikes us like a malignant disorder.  A most 
miserable subject for contemplation is no doubt furnished by the present 
condition and future prospects of our cotton trade, and of the hundreds of 
thousands implicated in it; but even this, the South may be well assured, 
will not tempt us to force the blockade.  We can and shall wait for better 
times and wiser counsels.</p>

<p rend="center">MUNSON'S HILL, WITH THE EARTHWORK THROWN UP BY THE<lb/>
 CONFEDERATES IN FRONT OF THE UNION LINES, VIRGINIA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> is the point in Virginia at which 
the Unionists and the Confederates are nearest each other, and whilst our 
Artist was making his sketch, crouched beneath the shelter of the foliage, 
within hailing distance of the enemy's pickets, a continual spattering of 
bullets fell round the spot.  More than halfway up the road towards the hill 
is a barricade, from behind which a Secessionist sharpshooter is having some 
pot shots, and, screened by the hedges in the cornfields, others are doing the
 same.  In the foreground are the Union advanced pickets, furnished by the 
Michigan Regiment, one of whom is in the act of firing at two or three men 
beyond the barricade.  A Michigan soldier just shot lies in the road.  The 
Confederates have some rifled cannon on the earthwork, and whenever they see 
a number of Federalists together they send in a dose of shells.</p>
<p>A New York paper thus describes the Confederate position on 
Munson's-hill:—"Munson's-hill is probably the highest eminence within ten 
miles of the Potomac, immediately opposite Washington.  It is about six miles from the Capitol, the intervening space being covered with a succession 
of gently rolling hills, crowned principally with forest trees, although here 
and there dotted with churches, farmhouses, and country villages.  The streams 
are unimportant and the roads dusty.  The hill presents its most abrupt side 
towards the national capital, and, unlike those around, has but few trees on 
its summit.  Many of those which originally existed have no doubt been felled
 while the intrenchments were in progress.  At present an immense Confederate
 flag—the red, white, and blue stripes in which  are at least five feet wide 
each—is the most prominent object upon the top of the eminence  Two of the 
trees which have been allowed to remain were used as an observatory.  The 
Confederate defences are constructed entirely of earth, fifteen feet being 
the highest elevation.  The sloping hillside in front of the fort is clear of 
underbrush or trees, and is sufficiently extended to allow 3000 men to parade. 
 The distance from the cover of the woods to the summit of the hill is not 
so great but that a quick movement would drive the enemy from their guns with 
very little loss of life.  The flank defences of the fort consist of three 
batteries.  It is believed that earthworks have been thrown up on another 
portion of the hill commanding the road to Fairfax Courthouse.  The fort is 
intended more particularly to command the road leading from Alexandria to 
Falls Church, the road from Washington to Fairfax, just mentioned, the railroad 
from Alexandria to Vienna, and the position of Bailey's Cross-roads."</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the Canadian steamer Anglo-Saxon we 
have advices from New York to the 28th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">THE WAR IN MISSOURI.</p>
	  <p>On the 20th ult. Colonel Mulligan surrendered Lexington to the 
besieging force of the Confederates.  The men had fought for fifty-nine hours
 without water, and had only three barrels of vinegar to quench their thirst. 
 Previous to the surrender Colonel Mulligan offered to take a position on a 
level spot of ground and give General Price the odds of four to one in a fair 
and open fight, but no attention was paid to the challenge.  About 250,000 
dollars in gold fell into the possession of the captors.  The morning after 
the surrender the men were all released on parole not so [sic] serve again 
during the war, and ferried across the river.  The officers were retained.  
Colonel Mulligan's loss was about 150, while that of General Price was not 
more than 300.  Much dissatisfaction is felt by the Administration and the 
public that General Fremont did not send troops in time to relieve Lexington.  
General M'Culloch, at the head of 15,000 Confederates, was within fifteen miles
 of Lexington on the 21st.  A slight engagement had also taken place at 
Papinsville, in the same State, to the advantage of the Federals, under 
General Lane.</p>
	  <p>The complaints against General Fremont multiply on all sides.  
He is accused of extravagance in the expenditure of public money, 
superciliousness of demeanour, and of living in too sumptuous a style, 
surrounded, moreover, by a body guard.  The Germans of the north-west are 
stanch partisans of Fremont, and it is doubtful if the Administration will 
think it expedient to remove him.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NAVAL EXPEDITION.</p>
	  <p>Sherman's naval expedition against the Southern coast will sail in 
three weeks' time from our latest dates at the farthest.</p>

<p rend="center">KENTUCKY.</p>
	  <p>The neutrality of this State has ceased to exist.  General Buckner,
 of the Confederate army, occupies Bowling Green, in Southern Kentucky, and 
will hold it until driven out or until the Federals retire.  General Anderson, 
of Fort Sumter fame, is in command of the Federalists at Louisville.  Both 
Generals are Kentuckians.  The war in Kentucky, as in Missouri and Western 
Virginia, will partake of all the repulsive features of a truly civil war, 
opinion in that State being very equally divided between the two parties.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
	  <p>The Comte de Paris and Duc de Chartres have been added to General 
M'Lellan's Staff.  The young Comte de Penthièvre, son of Prince de Joinville,
 was to enter the United States' Naval Academy.  Count Liebenhoff, of Russia; 
Lieutenant Oscar Brendeuer, of Prussia; Major Bausenwein, Aide-de-Camp to 
Garibaldi; Lord Aldophus Vane Tempest, of England; Captains Vegesackand 
Holtman, of Sweden; and Major Kirk, of Canada, have taken service in the 
Federal Army.</p>
	  <p>Mr. Seward has refused to accede to the prayer of a memorial that 
he would prevent the continuance of Mr. Russell's letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.  In a 
carefully-worded letter, he says it has not been the practice of the United 
States' Government to concern itself with the representations made by the press 
of foreign countries.  The American press is free to reply thereto.  Moreover, 
the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> only circulates about fifty copies in the 
United States.  For the offence of republication American editors, not the 
Enlgish correspondent, are liable.  A hundred foreigners as intellligent, 
virtuous, and respectable as Mr. Russell is are, says Mr. Seward, daily 
enrolling themselves in the Federal Army.  The country can, therefore, 
afford to tolerate the heresies of one man.</p>
	  <p>Secretary Seward grants passports to coloured men who are desirous 
of proceeding to Europe.  Since the Dred Scott decision, passports had been 
refused to this class.  Secretary Cameron has forbidden coloured men to appear 
in Washington dressed in military uniform.  A portion of the 2000 slaves who 
had fled to Fort Monroe have been sent to Washington and set to work there by 
the Department of War.</p>
	  <p>Mr. Seward has issued a circular in explanation of the 
Confiscation Act, in which he states that the law only contemplates a seizure 
of such property as may be in transit to or from insurrectionary States or 
used for the promotion of the rebellion; and that real estate, bonds, 
promissory notes, and moneys on deposit are not subject to confiscation in 
the absence of evidence of such unlawful uses.</p>


<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>
	  <p>On the 26th ult. the observance of a national fast and humiliation 
took place.</p>
	  <p>Prince Napoleon and the Princess Clotilde had left New York for 
Boston and the manufacturing towns of Massachusetts, with which they expressed 
themselves much pleased.</p>
	  <p>Vigorous measures for the suppression of the slave trade are being
 taken in New York.  Two vessels have been condemned in that city for 
participating therein.</p>
	  <p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> publishes the 
following list of "peace party" newspapers suspended since the commencement 
of the war:—"Papers suspended by the authorities, 17; destroyed by mobs, 10; 
died naturally, 5; denied the mails, 5; changed their politics, 7; whose 
editors are in prison, 6."</p>
	  <p>The Boston correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Springfield 
Republican</hi> gives an account of the way in which the President was 
reluctantly persuaded to sign the bill confiscating the slaves which were 
used in aid of the "rebellion."  He says:—</p>
	  <p>We got over a bad difficulty when President Lincoln was persuaded 
by Bingham, Wade, Wilson, and Sumner  to sign  the Confiscation Bill, against
 not only his will, but against his apparently fixed intention.  I see that
 Russell has let out the main facts, but there are some details.  The bill 
was carried to the President by Senator Bingham of Michigan, of the Committee
 on Enrolled Bills.  It was in the last half hour of the Session, and the 
adjournment could not be delayed.  Bingham took an interest in the bill, and 
waited to see what old Abe would do with it.  The President looked it over 
carefully and laid it down.  "You don't sign this bill, Mr. President?" said 
Bingham, inquiringly.  "No: I am not going to sign it."  "Well, then, will you
 at least veto it, and send it back so we can pass it if we chose[sic]?"  "No, 
I shan't do that."  "What are your objections, Mr. President?"  "It will lose 
us Kentucky."  "D—n Kentucky!"  exclaimed Bingham.  The President looked up 
good-humouredly and retorted, "Then d—n you!"  Bingham, it seems to me, had 
an excuse in the emergency which pressed upon him and the frivolous character,
 to him, at least, of the President's excuse; and old Abe may be pardoned for 
disliking to hear his native State anathematised.  Well; Bingham rallied the 
Senators whose names I have mentioned, and perhaps others, and they persuaded
 the President to sign the bill.  I believe Mr. Seward assisted in the good 
work.</p>
	  <p>Under the influence of Western orders and war expenditure, 
business is reviving in the Atlantic States, and many factories which had
 closed their doors in the spring have resumed operations on full time.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NATIONAL LOAN.</p>
	  <p>A great number of agencies for receiving subscriptions have been 
opened in different parts of the country, and small amounts are subscribed, 
but the receipts have fallen off considerably at New York, and the aggregate
 subscription from the whole country has not, during the week under review, 
exceeded 500,000 dollars per diem.  Nevertheless, there is no doubt the banks 
will furnish the second 50,000,000 dols. on the 15th inst., although they will 
not have disposed of the whole of the first installment of the loan to the 
public.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>
	  <p>In the State election the Republican ticket has prevailed by a 
large majority.  It is doubtful whether the war or peace democratic ticket 
polled the next largest number of votes.</p>
	  <p>There are a large number of Texans arriving in California by the 
overland route.  They are mostly of Unionist sympathies, and represent the 
state of things in Texas as deplorable.</p>
	  <p>The commissioners appointed to settle the boundary between 
British and American territory have completed their work.</p>

	  <p>The following telegram was received through Mr. Reuter's office 
yesterday (Friday):—</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">America</hi>.—New York, Sept 28.—It is reported from 
Washington that the Confederates have erected a long line of batteries on the 
Lower Potomac.  Several Federal steamers passing up and down have been fired 
into.  A considerable force of Confederates is assembled between Occoquan and 
Acquia Creeek [sic].  It is rumoured that they will endeavour to cross the 
river at this point.  General Fremont and his Staff have left for Jefferson 
city.  It is estimated that the Confederates captured at Lexington a million 
and a half dollars, seven cannon, and 4000 rifles.  The Federal troops have 
stormed and captured Romney, Western Virginia.  The Confederates retreated 
to the mountains.</p>

	  <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> two great armies still stand at 
bay on the lines of the Potomac, and the chain-bridge across that river, 
above Georgetown, of which an Illustration by our Special Artist is given 
below, is a position of great interest just now, as the Confederates are 
continually making threatening movements in the neighbourhood, either with 
the intention of destroying the bridge or of crossing by it into Maryland.  
On the heights on the Virginian shore are seen the tents of the Federal advance,
 which throws out pickets to a distance of two miles beyond.  The Maryland end 
of the bridge is commanded by an upper and a lower battery, both of them very 
strong positions.</p>
	  <p>On the opposite page we give an Illustration, from a Sketch by 
our Special Artist, of the bringing in the Federal wounded after the skirmish 
at Lewinsville, Virginia.  Just as the wounded were being brought in General 
M'Clellan reached the ground with an Aide-de-Camp and an escort of dragoons.  
He raised his hat as each poor fellow was borne from the ambulance to the 
hospital; and many whose eyes were fast glazing in death raised themselves 
in the arms of those who bore them and smiled a last smile at their young 
and beloved General.</p>
	  <p>Our Special Artist writes from Washington on the 23rd ult. as 
follows:—</p>
	  <p>"I have just come from a cruise down the Potomac, and while away 
I fell in with the officer who was bringing the news of the Scracoke affair 
to the Navy department.  The Sketch I forward is done over his own lines on 
the paper.  There will, in all probability, be more details by next mail.  I 
have got some river subjects, which will come on in a day or two.  In the 
meantime I send these two.  I expect to go out west, to Rosencrantz and 
Fremont; but yet we may have an attack here from hour to hour, and I dare 
scarcely leave.  Both sides are now awfully close together, and very, very 
strong.  I am waiting to get some definite notion of the next move on the 
cards, and shall then act promptly."</p>

	  <p>There can be no doubt that the armies of the Northern States of 
America are preparing for grand and various action, and now that the weather 
permits them to move freely we shall hear of simultaneous attacks upon Southern 
positions.  The enormous size of the "seat of war" is a condition of the 
contest not sufficiently taken into consideration here, and it is, indeed,
 difficult to realise it.  Without careful study of the map and due regard to 
the vast distances between the points at which hostilities are carried on or 
threatened, justice will not be done to the obstacles in the way of the chiefs
 on either side, and the fabulous-seeming numbers of the forces which are being 
brought up appear reasonable only when the extent of territory is taken into 
account.  We repeat that the Old World may now look to hear of actions on a 
larger scale than war has yet exhibited.  Meantime, the only demonstration 
calling for special notice is one against an Englishman.  The letters of Mr. 
William Russell have given so much offence to persons who dislike plain 
statements of disasters that application has actually been made to Mr. 
Seward to prevent the publication of these despatches.  Mr. Seward, however, 
perceives the absurdity of the demand to fight, as some vestries debate, 
"with closed doors and the exclusion of reporters," and he has declined to 
interfere, giving his refusal in a grave document, for the solemnity of 
which the Minister must have indemnified himself by non-official smiles at 
the enforced rotundity of his periods.  Two of the Orleanist Princes have 
placed themselves on General M'Lellan's staff, but have declined to receive 
pay for their services, a decision which may evince an honesty of estimate 
of their value.  The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, which is 
supposed to be really in the pay of the South, as heretofore and until its 
weathercock conversion, does its best to generate ill-feeling between the 
North and England, by a renewal of the ridiculous threat that as soon as the 
"rebellion" is put down English rule in America shall be swept away.  But our 
American brethren may rest assured that we distinguish between the feeling of 
a great and glorious nation and the malicious nonsense of an insincere and 
hireling scribbler.</p>

	  <p>The following memoir of Mr. Davis, President of the Confederate 
States of North America, is from specimen articles of the "New American 
Cyclopaedia," by George Ripley and Charles A. Dana:—</p>
	  <p>"Davis, Jefferson, an American soldier and statesman, born June 
3, 1808, in that part of Christian county, Kentucky, which now forms Todd 
county.  Soon after his birth, his father, Samuel Davis, a planter, who 
served during the revolutionary war in the mounted force of Georgia, removed 
with his family to Mississippi, and settled near Woodville, Wilkinson county.  
Young Davis received an academical education, and was sent at the usual age to 
Transylvania College, Kentucky, which he left in 1824 to enter the United 
States' Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated in 1828, and was 
appointed Brevet Second Lieutenant.  He remained in the army seven years, and 
served as an infantry and staff officer on the north-west frontier in the 
Black Hawk war of 1831-2, with such distinction that, March 4, 1833, he was 
promoted to a First Lieutenantcy of Dragoons, in which capacity he was 
employed in 1834 in various expeditions against the Comanchees, Pawnees, and 
other hostile Indian tribes.  He resigned his commission June 30, 1835, 
returned to Mississippi, and became a cotton-planter, living in retirement 
till 1843, when he began to take an active part in politics on the democratic 
side, and in 1844 was chosen one of the presidential electors of Mississippi 
to vote for Polk and Dallas.  In November, 1845, he was elected a 
representative in Congress, and took his seat in December of that year.  
He bore a conspicuous part in the discussions of the Session on the tariff, 
on the Oregon question, on military affairs, and particularly on the 
preparations for war against Mexico, and on the organisation of volunteer 
militia when called into the service of the United States.  While in Congress, 
in July, 1846, the 1st Regiment of Mississippi Volunteers, then enrolled for 
service in Mexico, elected him their Colonel.  He promptly left his seat at 
the House, and, overtaking his regiment in New Orleans, on its way to the seat 
of war, led to reinforce the army of General Taylor on the Rio Grande.  He 
was actively engaged in the attack and storming of Monterey, in September, 
1846; was one of the commissioners for arranging the terms of the capitulation 
of that city; and highly distinguished himself in the battle of Buena Vista, 
February 23, 1847, where his regiment, attacked by an immensely superior force,
 maintained their ground for a long time unsupported, while Colonel Davis 
himself, though severely wounded, remained in the saddle until the close of 
the action, and was complimented for his coolness and gallantry by the 
Commander-in-Chief in his despatch of March 6, 1847.  At the expiration of 
the term of its enlistment, in July, 1847, the Mississippi Regiment was 
ordered home; and Colonel Davis, while on his return, received at New Orleans 
a commission from President Polk as Brigadier-General of Volunteers, which 
he declined accepting, on the ground that the Constitution reserves to the 
States respectively the appointment of the officers of the militia, and that, 
consequently, their appointment by the Federal Executive is a violation of the 
right of the States.  In August, 1847, he was appointed by the Governor of 
Mississippi, United States, senator, to fill a vacancy; and at the ensuing 
Session of the State Legislature, Jan. 11, 1848, was unanimously elected to 
the same office for the residue of the term, which expired March 4, 1851.  In 
1850 he was re-elected for the ensuing full term.  In the Senate he was chosen 
Chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, and took a prominent part in 
the debates on the slavery question, in defence of the institutions and 
policy of the Slave States, and was a zealous advocate of the doctrine of 
State rights.  In September, 1851, he was nominated candidate for Governor 
of Mississippi by the Democratic party, in opposition to Henry S. Foote, 
the candidate of the Union party.  He resigned his seat in the Senate on 
accepting the nomination, and was beaten in the election by a majority of 
999 votes—a marked indication of his personal popularity in his own State, 
for at the 'convention election,' two months before, the Union party had a 
majority of 7500.  After his defeat Colonel Davis remained in retirement 
until the Presidential contest of 1852, when he took the stump in behalf of 
General Pierce in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Louisiana, where he rendered 
essential service to the democratic party.  In 1853 he was appointed by 
President Pierce Secretary of War, which post he held till the accession of
 President Buchanan in 1857.  His administration of the War department was 
marked by ability and energy, and was highly popular with the army.  He 
proposed or carried into effect, among other measures, the revision of the 
army regulations; the introduction of camels into America; the introduction 
of the light infantry or rifle system of tactics, the manufacture of rifled 
muskets and pistols, and the use of the Minié ball, the addition of 
four regiments to the army, the augmentation of the seacoast and frontier 
defences of the country, and the system of explorations in the western part 
of the continent for geographical purposes, and for the determination of the 
best route for a railroad to the Pacific Ocean.  Having been previously 
re-elected on his retirement from the War department, Colonel Davis 
re-entered the Senate for the term ending March, 1863.  In the sessions 
of the 35th Congress he has been conspicuous in the discussions on the 
French Spoliation Bill, which he opposed, and on the Pacific railroad for 
the southern route, of which he is a zealous and most influential advocate."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Some</hi> of our readers may possibly be puzzled, 
when reading American news, to find most important intelligence from California,
 Oregon, British Columbia, and the  Pacific side  of the continent of North 
America contained in a short paragraph headed "By Pony Express;" and the 
questions naturally arise, What is meant by a pony express?  where does it 
come from? where does it go? and why is it a pony express, and not a horse, 
or a stagecoach, or a railway express?  For the purpose of giving some 
information on this point, our Special Artist has taken the trouble to visit 
the locale of the pony express, to see it arrive and depart at its eastern 
terminus, and also to get a view of it enroute on the plains.</p>
<p>The great importance of maintaining rapid communication between the 
States of the American Union situated on the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards 
has long been felt, and numerous projects for connecting them by railways have 
been continually before Congress, but to the present time scarcely anything has 
been done either towards the railway or telegraph.  Between the Missouri River 
and California—a distance of 2000 miles—there exists a huge wilderness of 
prairies, arid plains, mountains, forests, and two huge mountain-chains—the 
Rocky and the Cascade Ranges.  Through the whole of this must an Atlantic and 
Pacific railway be carried when it is made, if it be made through the United 
States' Territory.  The railway works were extraordinary in perforating and 
climbing the Alleghanies.  Railways are now being made through the mountains 
in India, and in other places where tremendous obstacles have to be overcome, 
yet on none of the lines made or being made do such formidable barriers exist 
as are found between the Atlantic and Pacific States of the American Union.  
The present unhappy state of affairs—the waste of war—is draining the national 
exchequer dry, and deferring to a distant date the completion of the most 
important work the United States' Government has had in hand since the 
declaration of independence—the binding their eastern and western territory 
together with a band of iron.</p>
<p>Mr. W. H. Russell, of the firm of Russell, Major, and Waddel, extensive 
Government contractors for the conveyance of stores overland to the States on 
the west side of the Rocky Mountains, having observed the daily-increasing 
importance of a more rapid means of communication than then existed, hit upon 
the exceedingly bold idea of running a pony express from the Missouri River to 
the Pacific Ocean, carrying a telegram from New York, or any other part of the 
States, to San Francisco in eight days, and a letter in thirteen.  Those who 
knew the country through which the express must pass shook their heads, and 
said it would never do; the route was far north, the winter severe, the roads 
impassable, the snow lying often fifteen feet deep on the ground.  It then took
  115 days to make a quick passage between New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Mr. Russell was not the man to set aside a plan he had made up his mind he
 could carry out by any multiplication of difficulties: he therefore prepared 
to make the attempt.  First he built stations all along the route and stocked 
them well and plentifully, then engaged a corps of fearless and trustworthy 
riders, and purchased about six hundred horses, the very best that money could 
procure.  Having done all this and a great deal more that was necessary, on 
April 9, 1860, two ponies started simultaneously, one from San Francisco, and 
the other from St. Joseph, on the Missouri; and, although the season was most 
unfavourable, the mud being in some places two or three feet deep, yet the 
entire distance, one thousand nine hundred miles, was run in seven days and a 
half, carrying dispatches from New York and San Francisco.  This performance 
is the more remarkable because the early part of April is considered the very 
worst season of the year: the snows on the mountains are deep, and on the 
plains the rivers are swollen and filled with floating ice.  Old mountaineers 
consider April as bad as any winter month on the mountains, and worse on the 
plains.  The pony express, being "un fait accompli,"  continued to run 
regularly with letters once a week from each end, traveling invariably to a 
time schedule, until the month of June, when a source of trouble appeared  
which had long given cause for anxiety.  The wild Indians of the western plains 
began to meddle with the express, and shot dead from his horse one of the 
couriers.  His body was found a few days after, stripped of everything; but 
the bag of letters remained beside him untouched.  The horse and the firearms 
are what the Indians want, and they wisely consider that meddling with the 
letters would only unnecessarily irritate Uncle Sam without doing them any good.
The dangerous ground extended about three hundred and fifty miles from Salt 
Lake, in Utah territory, west to Carson City.  In this district the inter-
<pb n="387"/>ruptions became so incessant that it was considered necessary to 
"haul off the pony" from that particular section of the route.  On the other 
portions the express continued to run, delivering its letters at Salt Lake and 
Carson City, where they accumulated, waiting the first favourable opportunity 
to push through with safety.</p>
<p>Those unacquainted with the country west of the Rocky Mountains can scarcely 
appreciate the difficulty  and danger attending a journey through it.  For 
hundreds of miles it is a long dreary waste, inhabited only by bands of warlike 
Indians, who prowl about robbing and killing as they choose, and dotted at every
 fifteen miles of distance with the stations of the pony express, in charge of 
two or three persons. Occasionally  its monotony is broken by the passage of a 
train of emigrant <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> bound west to California or
 Oregon.  Night and day, heedless of the weather or the attacks of the redskins,
 the pony courier dashes along, at the rate of twelve miles an hour, his 
revolver in his belt, his hand on the trigger of his rifle, his eye watching 
intently for redskins, so that he may have the first shot; under him, on the 
saddle, is the bag of letters so anxiously looked forward to in New York, for 
they tell important things—how ships have sailed for Europe laden with 
Californian gold, of terrible wrecks and losses, or of rising markets and great
 gains, or perhaps how the votes have counted that decide the destiny of 
States.  Not only to America is this bold and solitary rider's leather 
saddle-bag of interest, but on to Europe will electricity and steam send many 
a long-looked-for message which it contains; and the merchant on many a change 
in the Old World will tell of news he has received so soon from the farthest 
shores of the Pacific.  He little knows, and less cares, for the hairbreadth 
dangers run by this lonely courier of the plains and mountains.  Altogether, 
the Pony Express Company have lost six men killed by the Indians.  They, 
however, provide liberally for the wives and families, if there be any.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that they have as yet lost only one mail, and this 
one was lost under peculiar circumstances.  The letters are inclosed in two 
leather bags, which are slung across the pony's back, and are kept in their 
place by the rider sitting on them, so that in case of anything happening to 
him the bags fall off and are recovered, though the pony scamper off and be lost.
  In the case alluded to the rider had, against special instructions, fastened 
the bags to the saddle.  On a dark night in July, 1860, the express, bound 
east, on crossing the bridge over the Platt River, stumbled over an ox that
 had taken up its quarters there for the night, and was precipitated into 
the river.  The rider reached the shore, but the pony and the mails were gone 
no one knows wither, never having been heard of to this day.</p>
<p>The company have suffered severely from first to last by the depredations
 of the Indians; they are, however, now in a much better state.  The express 
was almost driven off the line west of Salt Lake City, their stations being 
burnt or otherwise destroyed, their people killed, and their horses stolen.  
All, however, is now repaired and in better order than ever—the troops of the 
United States' Government and a force <choice><reg>organized</reg><orig>organised</orig></choice> 
by the company having driven the Indians away, and made them as scarce, and 
their occupation as dangerous, as it would be in the State of New York.</p>
<p>There is nothing very particular about either the pony or the rider: the 
riders are small, courageous, active young men, capable of great endurance; 
the ponies, or rather small horses, are the best description of animals for 
the purpose that can be procured.  There is nothing showy or ornamental about 
either riders or horses; yet they are very picturesque, and are evidentally 
got up entirely for business.  Our Artist saw one of the expresses arrive at
 St. Joe.  The young man who rode was a long, wiry, reddish-haired chap, who 
 looked made to <choice><reg>gallop</reg><orig>galop</orig></choice> through the world on a horse's 
back.  He wore a red worsted shirt, a rowdy hat, and a long, light-blue 
great-coat, with a little cope and plenty of brass buttons.  This young man 
had ridden on one occasion two hundred miles in twenty-four hours without 
rest or food, except such as he could get on the <choice><reg>pony's</reg><orig>poney's</orig></choice> back.  The rider usually rides fifty miles, using two ponies, who 
run twenty-five miles each.</p>
<p>The pony express does not pay the running expenses directly, but the 
company continue it nevertheless, allowing a little extra time during the 
winter.</p>
<p>St. Joseph, or St. Joe, as it is irreverently called by the Americans, 
is a pretty good town situated on the east bank of the Missouri River: it 
is the western terminus of the <choice><reg>Hannibal</reg><orig>Hanibal</orig></choice> and St. 
Joe Railway, which completes the American system of railways westward.</p>
<p>St. Joe has much the same relation to the great plains that a seaport has 
to the ocean: it is the point of arrival and departure after a three-months' 
voyage overland of hundreds of travellers and <choice><reg>wagon</reg><orig>waggon</orig></choice>-trains who make the passage between California, Oregon, and the Western States 
of the Union.  The passage across the mountains and over the plains is as 
lonely as a voyage across the ocean.  Neither towns nor villages are met with, 
and the emigrant-train has to depend upon its own resources as much as a ship 
does while navigating the sea.</p>
<p>There is a wild look about the people at St. Joe.  Nearly everybody carries 
a rifle, and has that peculiar expression of countenance which indicates the 
possession of the ability to take care of himself and cut up particularly rough 
if interfered with.  Some awful roughs may be seen about occasionally, but 
these are held in good check by the respectable portion of the place; and, 
although St. Joe is a wild, out-of-the-way place, almost beyond the reach of
 the law, yet the people go about as safely, and carry on their business as 
securely, as if they were in the neighbourhood of Boston.  Should any of the
 border ruffian class attempt any villany, Lynch law would most likely cut 
short his career, and he might find himself hanging to the branch of a tree 
before he had time to engage counsel to prove his innocence of the crime w
hich he was caught in the act of executing.  It is an event and a picturesque 
scene to see one of the long trains of <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> 
arrive from the westward, the people looking so brown and weather-worn and 
the children healthy and happy, and the rush all make immediately on certain 
shops and stores.  One great delight on the part of the men seems to be to 
get themselves shaved as clean as possible; fine bright-coloured shirts and
 handkerchiefs are immediately obtained and ostentatiously exhibited.</p>
<p>Market-day at St. Joe is a peculiar sight, and gives one a better idea of 
the back-settlement life than can be obtained anywhere else.  The farmer and 
his family, in their particular <choice><reg>wagon</reg><orig>waggon</orig></choice>, which, with 
the exception of the wheels, they have made themselves, are things to be seen.
  There is no place in the United States where greater variety of character, 
interesting incidents, and opportunity for the study of human nature, exists 
to a greater extent than at St. Joe, on the Missouri.</p>

<p>We shall give an Illustration of the town of St. Joe in an early Number.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Journeys and Explorations In the Cotton Kingdom.</hi> By<lb/> 
<hi rend="smallcaps">Frederick Law Olmsted</hi>.  Sampson Low and Son.</p>
<p>At this moment the word "cotton" sounds so ominously in the ears of 
political economists that it is not to be wondered at that publications on 
that subject are somewhat rife.  There is enough of anxiety and doubt with 
regard to this staple article of raw material to render any statistical statements welcome, and to cause any amount of the cotton-growing regions of 
America to be interesting.  Mr. Olmstead's observations on cotton and slavery 
in the American Slave States, which, we are informed, are based on three former
 volumes of journeys and investigations by the same author, are written by a 
gentleman who went directly from his farm in the State of New York into the 
Slave States.  It is probable, therefore, that one qualification for this 
work—entire impartiality—may in some degree be wanting; but, on the whole, 
there does not appear to be any desire on the part of the writer to 
misrepresent or exaggerate. He appears to write honestly, if with
somwhat preconceived opinions. Perhaps the insensible influences at work in his 
mind are most brought to bear in his first chapter—on the "Present Crisis,"  
and which is introductory to the rest of the work.  Here he starts with an 
assertion that the rest of the citizens of the United States have submitted 
to many indignities in order to preserve the tranquillity of the South; and, 
in answer to the dogma that the South can never be subjugated, he replies that 
it must, or the North must; that it must be, or not only is the American 
Republic a failure, but its English justice, its English law, and its English 
freedom are failures.  It need hardly be added that the whole argument in this 
chapter goes to show that slavery is beneficial neither to the proprietors of 
slaves nor to the cultivation of cotton.  He maintains that one of the grand 
errors out of which the rebellion of the South has grown came from supposing 
that whatever nourishes wealth and gives power to an ordinary 
 <choice><reg>civilized</reg><orig>civilised</orig></choice> community must command as much for a 
slave-holding community.  He contends that the truth has been overlooked, 
that the accumulation of wealth and the power of a nation are contingent not 
merely upon the primary value of the surplus of productions of which it has 
to dispose, but very largely, also, upon the way in which the income from 
its surplus is distributed and reinvested.  "Let a man," he says, "be absent 
from any part of the North twenty years, and he is struck on his return by 
what are called 'improvements' which have been made—better buildings, churches,
 schoolhouses, mills, railroads, &amp;c.  In New York City alone, for instance, 
at least two hundred millions of dollars have been reinvested merely in an 
improved housing of the people; in labour-saving machinery, waterworks, 
gasworks, and so on, as much more.  It is not difficult to see where the 
profits of the merchants and manufacturers are.  Again, go into the country 
and there is no end of substantial proof of twenty years of agricultural 
prosperity, not alone in roads, canals, bridges, dwellings, barns, and fences, 
but in books and furniture, and gardens and pictures, and in the better dress 
and evidently higher education of the people.  But where will the returning 
 <choice><reg>traveler</reg><orig>traveller</orig></choice> see the accumulative cotton profits of 
twenty years in Mississippi?  Ask the cotton-planter for them, and he will 
point, in reply, not to dwellings and churches, libraries, schoolhouses, 
mills, railroads, or anything of the kind; he will point to his negroes—to 
almost nothing else.  Negroes such as stood for 500 dollars represent now 
1000 dollars.  It is to Virginia and those Northern Slave States which have 
the monopoly of supplying negroes for the real wealth which the sale of 
cotton has brought to the South.  But where is the evidence of it?  where 
anything to compare with the evidence of accumulated profits to be seen in 
any free State?  If certain portions of Virginia have been a little improving, 
others unquestionably have been deteriorating—growing shabbier, more 
comfortless, less convenient.  The total increase in wealth of the population 
during the last twenty years shows almost for nothing.  One year's improvements 
of a Free State exceed it all."  Again the author observes:—"Whither the profits
 of cotton go it is not my purpose here to undertake to show.  I will barely 
notice the hypocritical statement made for the English market as an apology 
for the mad crime of  the slaveholders, that they are greatly absorbed  in 
contributions made by the Planting States to our national treasury in payments 
of duties on importations.  The cotton-planters pay duties only on what they 
consume of foreign goods.  A very large part of all our duties are collected 
on a class of goods for which there is almost no demand at all from the South, 
either directly or indirectly— <choice><reg>woolen</reg><orig>woollen</orig></choice> and fur goods, 
for instance.  Of the goods required for the South not a few have been 
practically free.  The whole slave population of the South consumes almost 
nothing imported (nor could it, while slave, under any circumstances).  The 
majority of the white population habitually makes use of no foreign production 
except chicory, which, ground with peas, they call coffee.  I have never seen
 reason to believe that with absolute free trade the Cotton States could take 
a tenth part of the value of our present importations; and, as far as I can 
judge from observation of the comparative use of foreign goods at the South and
 at the North, not a tenth part of our duties have been defrayed by the South 
in the last twenty years.  The most indefensible protective duty we have is 
one called for by the South, and which has been maintained solely to benefit 
the South.  Our protective system had a Southern origin, and its most powerful 
advocates have been Southerners, and there has not been a year in the last 
twenty in which it could have been maintained but for Southern votes."</p>
  <p> Having thus let Mr. Olmsted speak his opinions for himself, evidencing 
the spirit in which he most likely undertook his journey to the South, we 
proceed to state that his first <choice><reg>traveling</reg><orig>travelling</orig></choice>
chapter begins at Washington, and it contains some not unamusing sketches 
of life and character in that capital.  It is stated that the coloured 
population voluntarily sustain several churches, schools, and mutual 
assistance and improvement societies, and there are evidently among them 
persons of no inconsiderable cultivation of mind.  Among the police reports 
of the city newspapers there appeared an account of the apprehension of 
tweny-four "genteel, coloured men" (so they were termed) who had been found 
by a watchman assembling privately in the evening, and had been lodged in the
 watchhouse.  The object of their meeting appeared to be purely benevolent, 
and when they were examined before a magistrate in the morning no evidence 
was offered, nor did there seem to have been any suspicion that they had any criminal 
purpose.  On searching these persons there were found a Bible, a volume of 
"Seneca's Morals," "Life in Earnest," the printed constitution of a society 
the object of which was said to be "to relieve the sick and to bury the dead;" 
and a subscription-paper to purchase the freedom of Eliza Howard, a young woman
 whom her owner was willing to sell for 650 dols.  Characteristic enough all 
this; but it must be understood that these were not slaves.  The transit which 
our traveler next makes through Virginia is minutely set out with all its 
details of life and character, especial attention being paid to descriptions 
of negro life, habits, and status.  The conclusion to which he arrives with 
regard to the economic condition of the State may be summed in a phrase which 
he uses when he says that it is "shiftless."  As a whole, the community makes 
shift to live, some part tolerably, the most part wretchedly enough, with 
arrangements such as one might expect to find in a country in stress of war. 
 North Carolina is dealt with almost equally in detail, and fares no better 
in the author's opinion.  South Carolina and Georgia are next surveyed, and 
thence the route is through the south-west to Alabama and Mississippi on to 
Louisiana, and thence through Texas.  In Louisiana the sugar estates and the 
machinery meet with more favourable notice than usually characterises the 
writer's observations.  After a description of a passage through South-western
 Louisiana and Eastern Texas, a trip into Northern Mississippi, and the 
interior cotton districts of Central Mississippi, &amp;c., the work treats of 
the exceptional large planters, of slavery in its property aspect, moral and
 religious instruction of the slaves; of slavery as a poor-law system, in which
 an elaborate comparison is given between the condition and sustentation of the
 Northern and Southern labourers.  The chapter on Cotton Supply and White 
Labour in the Cotton Climate is well worth consideration, as therein is argued 
the whole question whether the production of cotton depends on slave labour or 
not.  Equally interesting are the dissertations contained in the sections which
 relate to the condition and character of the privileged classes of the South, 
and that on the danger of the South.  That they are discussed in something of 
the tone of an advocate was to be expected; but the argument is so filled out 
with facts and statements of effects traceable to undoubted causes that those 
who read the work before us from a purely abstract and unconventional point of
 view will gain much—very much—on which to ground an unbiassed opinion.  In an
 appendix a collection of ststistics is given relating to the condition of 
Virginia;  but it was hardly to be expected that under the head of "The Slave
 Trade in Virginia" we should find reproduced only an extract from <hi rend="italic">Chambers's
 Journal</hi>.  There are also some statistics of the Georgia seaboard.  It should
 be stated that the book, although dealing with very serious subjects, and 
treating them in a very serious spirit, is by no means a dry narrative of 
travel and a pedantic description of what was seen, and heard, and collected. 
 On the contrary, it is continually broken by lighter matter; and attempts—not
 wholly unsuccessful—have been made to give it in many parts a popular—that is, 
an amusing—tone.  As a whole, it will, we think, be found acceptable to those 
in this country—and they are many—who, watching the painful contest which is now
 going on in America, may desire some insight which they did not possess before
 into its motive causes.</p>

<p><hi rend="small caps">By</hi> the steam-ship City of New York we have 
received advices from New York to the 5th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Confederate forces opposite Washington have evacuated their lines and 
fallen back on Manassas Junction.  The Federals have advanced and occupied the
 deserted positions.  Great devastation was committed by the Federal troops on
 the property of the resident population, quite irrespective of their politics.
  General M'Clellan has issued an order denouncing these excesses, and menacing
 the perpetrators with the penalty of death.  The intrenchments thrown up by 
the Confederates were of a very inferior kind, and excite the contempt of the 
Unionists.</p>
<p>The telegram published in the daily journals that General Mansfield had 
"surprised" General Wool at Fortress Monroe is a mistake, and must mean 
"succeeded," as General Wool has left Fort Monroe for Washington, and General 
Mansfield is a Federal General, lately chef d'état under General Scott.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia the Federals have had two successful engagements with 
the Confederates.  In that which took place in the Kanawha Valley they claim 
to have killed sixty of the Confederates and to have taken seventy prisoners.</p>
<p>In Kentucky a new and immense battle-field has been opened.  From Cumberland
 Gap on the east, to the Mississippi on the west-a distance of more than 
300 miles, the Confederates occupy a line of posts.  In Northern Kentucky 
they are confronted by a parallel line of Union camps.  General Anderson, 
who is in feeble health, has been superseded in command of the Federal forces 
in Kentucky by General Sherman.  A collision may occur at any moment.</p>
<p>General Fremont has taken the field in Missouri, and is in pursuit of 
General Price.  General Price has evacuated Lexington and gone southward, 
hoping to cut off General Siegel.  Lexington is again occupied by Federal 
troops.  General Price reports that his entire loss in the capture of Lexington
 was 25 killed and 72 wounded.  About 3500 prisoners, including 4 colonels, 
1 major, and 118 other commissioned officers, 5 pieces of artillery and 2 
mortars, over 33,000 stand of infantry arms, a large number of sabers, about 
750 horses, many sets of cavalry equipments, <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>,
 teams, ammunition, more than 100,000 dollars' worth of commissary stores, the
 great seal of state, the public records, and about 900,000 dollars in money 
were the fruits of this victory.  The money was restored to the bank from 
which the Federalists had taken it.</p>
<p>The report that several vessels had run the blockade at the mouth of the 
Mississippi is unfounded; but the British steamer Bermuda, freighted with 
blankets and warm clothing for the Confederate army, had succeeded in getting 
into Savannah.  She cleared from Liverpool for the West Indies.  The Federal 
gun-boat Fanny, of which a Sketch is given in our Issue this week (at page 411),
 has been captured by the Confederates inside Hatteras, near Roanoke Island.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL FREMONT'S POSITION.</p>

<p>Colonel Blair has been released from custody on the order of General Scott,
 as General Fremont neglected to file his charges against the insubordinate 
Colonel.  A rumour prevailed that he had been removed from his command by the 
authorities at Washington.  Great excitement at St. Louis was the result.  
Recruiting offices were closed, and indignation meetings were called.  A 
telegram from Mr. Seward, assuring the people that General Fremont was not 
ordered to Washington, nor was any court-martial ordered concerning him, 
quieted the public apprehensions.</p>
 <p>The course of the President in <choice><reg>canceling</reg><orig>cancelling</orig></choice> 
the liberating clause of General Fremont's proclamation is still much 
canvassed by the public.   The Democrats and Conservative Republicans support 
the President; the Abolitionists and Radical Republicans support Fremont.  
Parker Pillsbury writes in the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Slavery Standard</hi>:—
"political flumes, floodgates, and embankments are now all swept away, and 
one whelming deluge of devotion to the Union, <hi rend="italic">as it was</hi>, 
with slavery eternised, is now sweeping over the country from ocean to ocean.  
Only the pebble-stone protest of a few faithful Abolitionists (alas, how very 
few!) any longer obstruct its terrible course."</p>

<p rend="center">ARMY NEWS.</p>

<p>The Governor of Iowa having commensed to draft troops, the Secretary of War 
has forbidden the practice, expressing his confidence in the patriotism of the 
people to supply volunteers enough for the war.  The State of New York has not 
yet contributed two-thirds of the 25,000 men demanded of her under the last call
 for volunteers.  Recruiting for the regular army is an entire failure, not 
above six men a week being obtained in New York City.  The Government find no
 difficulty in obtaining sailors.  The reports of the sick and wounded in the
 Federal hospitals at Washington, Georgetown, and Alexandria on the 27th ult. 
showed the number remaining to be 961.  There was a great scarcity of blankets 
for the Federal army, and the Quartermaster-General was calling on the public 

to furnish supplies.</p>

<p rend="center">TRADE AND FINANCE.</p>
 <p>The second <choice><reg>installment</reg><orig>instalment</orig></choice> of 50,000,000 dollars 
has been taken by the banks of the three principal Atlantic cities, in the old 
proportion and on the old terms—namely, 7-10ths by New York, 2-10ths by Boston, 
and 1-10th by Philadelphia.  The public, between Aug. 19 and Sept. 21, had 
taken 18,934,000 dols. of the loan, which was paid back by the Government to 
the banks.  This sum had been taken in this ratio:—At New York, 10,640,000 
dols.; Boston, 5,000,000 dols; Philadelphia, 2,294,000 dols.; other agencies, 
say, 1,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>The export of grain to England and France continues very large, and exchange 
on England has fallen to 107.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FREE NEGROES.</p>

<p>The following statistics of the free blacks resident in the United and 
Confederate States have been compiled from the recent census returns.  The 
number in the free-labour States, the district of Columbia, and the Territories 
is 223,073; in the adhering Slave States, 116,750; in the eleven Seceded States,
 131,401:  grand total, 481, 115.  The free blacks in the Free-labour States 
are thus distributed.  The six New England States, 23,141; New York, 47,998; 
New Jersey, 24,947; Pennsylvania, 56,373; Ohio, 36,225; Indiana, 10,869; six 
other North-Western States, 17,248;  California and Oregon, 3947; district of 
Columbia, 11,107; the Territories, 229.  In the adhering Slave States—Maryland,
 83,718; Delaware, 19,723; Kentucky, 10,146; Missouri, 2982.  In the Seceded 
States there are—Virginia, 57,579; North Carolina, 30,097; Louisiana, 18,638; 
South Carolina, 9648;  seven other Confederate States, 15,439.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>Mr. Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts, has made a speech before the 
Republican Convention at Worcester favourable to the idea of making the war 
one of liberation to the slaves as the only means of obtaining a solid peace.  
Mr. Sumner is the first professional politician who has taken this ground.</p>
<p>Ex-President Buchanan has published a letter in favour of a vigorous 
prosecution of the war for the restoration of the Union.</p>
<p>Prince Napoleon sailed from Boston for St. John's and Havre on the 26th 
ult.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> announces its average daily 
circulation to  be 102,000.  On the day after the fall of Fort Sumter the 
impression amounted to 135,000, the largest ever issued.  In the three days 
succeeding the battle of Bull Run the daily sale was 122,740, 128,160, and 
117,840 respectively.  The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> of the same city

<p>Beyond a general impression that a battle on the Potomac must be impending, 
there is not much in the recent dispatches from the States.  The complaints of 
the cowardice of the Home Guards in the Lexington affair are reiterated, and the
 surrender of the place would, it seems clear, have been delayed but for the 
conduct of these volunteers.  The position, however, had become untenable, 
and there was no excuse for a further sacrifice of the lives of brave men.  
Why two of the Orleans Princes have been permitted to join in the struggle it
 is hard to say.  "The smell of powder has drawn them in the right direction,"
 writes a Prince at home here; but the explanation is slightly vague.  Even 
the North itself can hardly regard the act as a dignified one, the war being
 regarded in the Lincoln light of a great police demonstration.  But there 
is, of course, an intention to make capital somehow, and it may be held that 
the supposed necessity of keeping a name upon the tongue of France has 
instigated a step which looks like a mistake.  Only the <hi rend="italic">
New York Herald</hi> is delighted, because the enlistment of the Princes 
will, it is thought, be displeasing to the "British aristocracy," whose "gold, 
lavished upon fanatic abolitionists, has got up the war"—such is the trash 
printed for American mobs.  Be it added, that though this organ of public 
opinion is reasonably delighted at the enlisting of two real Princes, it adds 
a divertingly pathetic appeal to other officers not to be too proud to associate
 with certain German Volunteer Colonels merely because they are also 
beershop-keepers.  The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> justly remarks that 
there is nothing dishonourable in selling beer.  Certainly not, if the beer 
is good;—and what was Oliver Cromwell?</p>

<p> As the exact and official returns of the Census are being made public, we
 behold more clearly (says the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>) the 
precise march and direction of the population which has been filling up, 
during the last ten years, the unoccupied territory of the Union.  Its grand 
and main course is westward, with some currents to the north-west and some to 
the south-west.  The flood of population over some of our new States in the Far 
West has probably never been <choice><reg>equaled</reg><orig>equalled</orig></choice> in the history 
of emigration, both in the character of the emigrants and in the number placed 
upon new soil, where before were the animals of the prairie and the forest and 
the roving Indian.</p>
<p>Minnesota, for instance, increases from 6077 inhabitants in 1850 to 162,022 
 in 1860, or at the rate of increase of over 2500 percent; Oregon, from  18,294
 to 52,464, or at the rate of 294 per cent; Iowa, from 192,214 to 674,948, or 
at 251.22 per cent; Texas, from 212,592 to 602,432, or 183.37 per cent;
 Wisconsin, from 305,391 to 775,873, or 154.06 per cent; Arkansas increases 
107 per cent, and Illinois over 100 per cent.</p>
<p>The average rate of the growth of population in all the States the last 
decade is 35.02 per cent.  There are nineteen States below this average, the 
lowest in order being Vermont, 0.32 per cent; then New Hampshire, 2.55 per 
cent; and next South Carolina, 5.28; Maine following with 7.73; and Tennessee 
with 11.68, and once powerful Virginia with only 12.27, while North Carolina 
shows only 14.23.  There are eleven States counting 19,528,555 inhabitants, 
or an average of more than one million and a half each—namely, Illinois, 
Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, New York, Tennessee, Missouri, 
Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia.</p>
<p>In territories the greatest advance is, of course, in Utah, or 254.07 per 
cent; in New Mexico it reaches 51.98.</p>
<p>The black current must always be the important one to the statistician of 
this continent.  The Census reveals a steady stream of negroes from the 
seaboard towards the south-west.  Virginia retains her old pre-eminence as 
the breeder of slaves for market, in which <hi rend="italic">noble</hi> 
occupation she is apparently closely followed by South Carolina, while the 
States whither this disgusting traffic tends are Arkansas, Mississippi, and 
especially Texas.  The average increase of slaves is moderately large, or 
23.42 per cent.  There is a loss in but two States—Delaware (of 21.48 per cent.)
 and Maryland (3.52).  The increase in Virginia is only 3.88 per cent, and in
 South Carolina 5.28—this small advance evidently resulting from exportation.  
Kentucky, too, shows an increase of but 4.87 per cent the last decade, which
 gives a most gratifying prospect of the destiny of the system in  Kentucky,
 as it is believed no very important numbers have been exported during the last 
ten years from that State.  North Carolina only exhibits an advance of 14.74, 
and Tennessee of 15.17 per cent.  Missouri presents a larger increase than was
 expected—namely, 31.51.  The great increase is in Texas, where it reaches over
 210 per cent (210.66); in Arkansas it is 135.89; in Florida, 57.09; and in 
Mississippi, 40.93.</p>
<p>In two States only are the slaves more numerous than the whites—in South 
Carolina, where they number 402,541, against 291,623 of the white inhabitants;
 and in Mississippi, being 436,696 to 353,969 whites.  Their largest number in
 any one State is in Virginia (490,887), and the next in Georgia (462,232).</p>
<p>In the territories there are 10 slaves enumerated in Nebraska, 24 in New 
Mexico, and 29 in Utah.  The district of Columbia shows a loss of slaves of 
13.72 per cent.</p>
<p>Among the free coloured population the increase is very small through the 
Union—only 10.63 per cent.  Their largest numbers are to be found, as usual, 
in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Little valuable in a statistical point of view is to be extracted from the 
tables of this population, as the dimunition from banishment or emigration 
cannot be distinguished from that arising from natural and regular causes.  
The theory sustained recently by an able statistician in Washington 
(Mr. Weston), that the free negro inevitably diminishes on this continent, 
is not yet sufficiently confirmed by facts to be admitted as a satisfactory
 scientific hypothesis.  The race undoubtedly dies out in climates not 
adapted to it—as, for instance, in the Northern States; but whether it 
decays in freedom in the middle or Southern latitudes does not yet fully appear.
  In many of the Southern and Western States there are laws expelling the free
 negroes, and their decrease observed in those States during the last decade 
may be due to these extraneous causes.  Their greatest increase in a Slave 
State is in Georgia (18.01 per cent); in Alabama, 16.11; in Maryland, 12.04;
 the greatest decrease in Arkansas, 77.47.  Greatest increase in a Free 
State, in Minnesota, 487.18 per cent; in New York they lose 2.18 per cent.</p>
<p>It will probably be many decades before we shall show such a rapid growth 
of numbers as in the last.  The next Census will, no doubt, reveal new 
currents and new directions in our population.  Instead of streams from 
east to west, we may then have many from  north to south, and new results 
to chronicle in regard to the movements or decrease of the black population.</p>

<p rend="center">DESTRUCTION OF FORT OCRACOKE, ON BEACON ISLAND,<lb/>
 NORTH CAROLINA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> the 16th ult. an expedition left Fortress 
Monroe to take and destory the fort on Beacon Island, near the entrance to the 
Sound.  It was under the command of Lieutenant Eastman, of the Pawnee, and 
consisted of sixty-five men from the Coast Guard, and a detachment of sailors 
and marines from the Pawnee, in the ship's launch.  The Coast Guard were on 
board the Fanny, which towed the launch down.  The landing was safely effected.
  The fort was found deserted.  The remainder of the day and the next day were
 occupied in destroying the pieces of ordnance found in the fort, of which 
twenty-two were rendered unserviceable.  The torch was then applied to the 
bombproofs and magazines, and also to the lighthouse on the island.  The 
conflagration raged furiously all night, the light being plainly visible 
thirty miles distant.  After having completed the destruction of the fort, 
the expedition returned to Fort Monroe without the loss of a man.</p>

<p rend="center">CONFEDERATE DESERTER COMING INTO THE FEDERAL LINES AT<lb/>
 MUNSON'S HILL.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist in the Federal camp writes 
as follows respecting the second Engraving:—On the 19th inst., while I was 
out at the extreme advanced picket in front of the Confederate position at 
Munson's Hill, I was much startled by a sudden popping all along the enemy's 
line, the bullets pinging over our heads in every direction.  Raising myself 
cautiously I saw a Confederate soldier bounding through the tall Indian corn, 
and making for our lines, while two hundred yards behind him his former 
comrades were doing their best to stop his career.  He ran the gauntlet 
without a single shot taking effect, and turned out to belong to the 13th 
Virginian Regiment.  He told us that Jefferson Davis and Beauregard were 
on the hill reconnoitring, and that there were 180,000 Confederates between 
that post and Fairfax.</p>

M'Clellan with a score of generals and princes. There were M'Dowell, Porter, 
Keys, Blenker, Smith, and Marcy, all manly, gallant faces and figures
of tru military bearing; Colonels De Trobiand and Solm-Solm, with their dashing, 
chivalresque air; the Prince de Joinville, twisted and stooping, lounging on 
his horse; the Orleans princes, with their mild, amiable faces, and aspect of 
languid interest—in all, a most remarkable group of figures. A horse's length 
in advance sat the smallest man of the party, broad-shouldered, strong-chested,
 strong-necked, and strong-jawed, one hand upon his hip, while the other, by an
 occasional rapid motion flung some communication to the passing squadrons of 
calvary. The visor of his cap was well pulled down over his eyes, yet not a 
man in the lines escaped his observation. His glance seemed to take in at once 
the whole spectacle, yet without <choice><reg>losing</reg><orig>loosing</orig></choice> any of its 
smallest details. "He is a commander," said my Austrian friend. Something in 
his figure, his attitude, and the square, tenacious set of his jaws, reminded 
me strikingly of Field-Marshal Radetsky. I scanned the lines of his face in 
vain for some mark of weakness, indecision, or timidity. All was cool, firm, 
prompt, determined, and self-reliant. If he does not justify the hopes and 
expectations of the nation, physiognomy is of no value.—<hi rend="italic">Bayard Taylor in the Tribune</hi></p>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Edinburgh we have New York journals to the 
12th inst., and a short telegram from Cape Race to the evening of the 15th.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The scene of active operations has shifted for the moment from the land to 
the ocean.  At Hatteras Inlet, after some fluctuations of fortune, victory 
remains with the Federals.  The particulars of the capture of the propeller 
Fanny have been reported.  She was on her way from the inlet to Chicomacomica, 
the encampment of a Federal regiment, and was captured by three Confederate 
tugs which put out from Roanoke Island.  Two rifled cannon, twenty-five 
prisoners, and a cargo of commissary stores fell into the hands of the 
captors.  Emboldened by this success, on the 7th  inst., a Confederate 
expedition, said by the Northerners to have consisted of six  steamers and 
3000 men, attacked the Federal camp near Hatteras Inlet.  The Federals 
retreated, carrying away their tents and provisions and leaving fifty 
prisoners.  Two Federal steamers afterwards arrived with assistance and 
shelled the Confederates who had landed, forcing them to return to their 
steamers with heavy loss.  Two of the Confederate vessels were sunk.</p>
<p>A telegram to Cape Race reports from Norfolk, a Southern source be it 
remembered, what, if not exaggerated, more than compensates for the above 
disaster.  The Confederate fleet of gun-boats, which had been long preparing 
for the event, attacked the blockading squadron at New Orleans, and after a 
sharp fight had sunk one Federal vessel and driven the rest ashore.  Just 
before this attack the Federals had occupied Ship Island and constructed 
fortifications on the Head Passes of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>A large naval force, consisting of twenty ships, left New York for some 
point on the southern coast on the afternoon of the 12th inst.  Its exact 
destination was carefully kept secret from the public.</p>
<p>The army of the Potomac is slowly advancing its outposts.  The Confederates 
retire before them.  On the Upper Potomac all is quiet.  In Western Virginia,
 further Federal successes on a small scale are reported.  In Kentucky the 
hostile forces have not yet come into collison.  In Missouri, General Fremont 
has left St. Louis to take the field in pursuit of General Price.  He will 
march from twenty-five to forty miles a day, and, if necessary, will enter 
Arkansas.  Mr. Russell, writing on the 4th inst., assures impatient people 
in England "that no movement is at present contemplated in front of Washington;
 but that, before the month is over, land and sea will resound once more with 
the tumult of battle."</p>

<p rend="center">THE BLOCKADE.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda, whose entrance into Savannah in spite of the blockade
 we noticed last week, carried in a very valuable cargo.  She contained 
eighteen rifled cannon of 32 and 42 pounders; two Lancaster guns of 168lb. 
weight; powder, shot, and shells for the ordnance; 6500 Enfield rifles; 
from 200,000 to 300,000 cartridges; 6000 pairs of army shoes; 20,000 blankets;
  180 barrels of gunpowder;  and a large quantity of morphine, quinine, and 
other medical stores: in all, worth 1,000,000 dollars.  Remonstrances against
 her sailing were made by Mr. Adams in London, but the British Foreign Office 
did not see its obligation to interfere.</p>
<p>The Richmond papers state that the steamer Nashville, with Messrs. Mason 
and Slidell (the Confederate Commissioners to Europe) on board, ran the 
blockade at Charleston on the 12th inst.</p>
<p>Several British vessels have been brought before United States' prize 
courts on the charge of attempting to evade the blockade; and all, without 
exception, have been condemned.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis continues in very feeble health, and the politicians are  
looking about for a successor.  </p>
<p>The Governor of Louisiana has forbidden the entry of cotton into New 
Orleans, whether by steamer or railroad.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EXPEDITION TO MEXICO.</p>

<p>The New York journals look with great displeasure upon the prospect of 
order being restored in Mexico by a European intervention.  The 
<hi rend="italic">World</hi> believes that the United States' Government 
would not consent to proceedings which might eventually embroil America with
 the allied Powers.  The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> expresses itself as 
follows:—</p>
<p>But it is very certain that after it takes place Mexico will cease to be 
an independent Power, and European interests will assume to direct her policy 
and control her destiny.  That we can contemplate such a prospect with 
indifference is out of the question.  It interferes too directly and seriously
 with our traditions and <hi rend="italic">our hopes</hi>, as well as with 
our direct and immediate interests, not to enlist our warmest anxieties.  
If we were at peace and united among ourselves, we should unquestionably 
throw our whole weight against such a project, and even resist by force of 
arms the attempt to plant hostile institutions and a hostile policy in the 
pathway of our progress.  Whether we can safely pursue the same course now 
is a matter by no means free of doubt.  . . . One thing is very certain, our 
Government must not leave the foreign Powers who have formed this coalition 
in any doubt as to the sentiments we entertain in regard to their policy.  We 
must protest against it with all the directness and energy which the emergency 
requires.  How much further we may go in resisting it must depend on the 
contingencies of the future.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The American polar expedition arrived at Halifax on the 9th inst.  They 
were unable to penetrate through Smith's Straits, either this summer or last,
 on account of the heavy ice.  By means of dog-sleds, however, they succeeded 
in penetrating as far as latitude 81 deg. 35 min., on the west side of Kennedy 
Channel.</p>
<p>At the annual election in the State of Ohio the Union party has prevailed 
over the Democrats by a large majority.</p>
<p>A dispatch from Toronto, Canada West, to New York, says that Colonel Rankin,
 member of the Provincial Parliament, had been arrested in that city for having 
violated the Enlistment Act,  Colonel Rankin had been endeavouring to raise a 
regiment of lancers for the service of the United States' Government.</p>
<p>The Quartermaster-General has made an appeal to the people to furnish 
blankets, gratis or otherwise, for the use of the army, as they cannot be
 manufactured quickly enough.</p>

<p rend="center">THE LAST COTTON CROP.</p>

<p>The last cotton year closed on the 31st of August.  The total crop was 
3,656,086 bales, being a deficiency of  1,013,684 bales on the crop of 1859-60, 
and of 194,395 bales on that of 1858-9.  The total exports to Great Britain
 amount to 2,175,225 bales, being 494,207 bales short of the previous year.  
France falls short only 11,524 bales of last year; other foreign ports 78,882 
bales; while the takings of American spinners amount to 650,357 bales against 
786,521 bales last year.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi>  have news from America, but it is not very 
trustworthy as regards details.  It would seem, however, that the South has 
made an attempt to recover Fort Hatteras, and that such attempt has been 
unsuccessful.   The telegrams that announce the sinking of three of the 
Confederate steamers and the destruction of seven hundred men must be received 
with caution-indeed, the number of soldiers who have been slain—on paper—since 
the war began would make a great army, and we shall never know what quantity of
 commiseration to offer until the next Census is taken.  General M'Clellan is 
said to be now "ready," and, therefore, large and various operations may be 
heard of very soon.  The Southerners take no pains to keep the Old World aware 
of their real position and prospects, and therefore must not complain that we 
take all our impressions on the subject from their enemy: it is rational, 
however, to make liberal deduction from Northern accounts.  We have been 
amused, and probably our cousins on both sides of the Potomac will be equally 
diverted, with an offer of mediation which has been put forth.  Mr. Smith 
O'Brien, a returned convict, who was exported for a ridiculous treason, in 
which he behaved with more prudence than valour, and which was terminated 
by his being found hiding, like an overgrown slug, among the cabbages in a 
cottage garden, has undertaken to go over to America and adjust the 
differences between the North and South.  When his proposal shall be accepted 
we shall, no doubt, be officially informed of the fact.  An almost equally 
amusing incident has occurred on the other side of the water.  The petty 
spitefulness of some American who has been displeased with Mr. William 
Russell's letters induced the former to watch the Englishman's movements, 
and was rewarded by detecting Mr. Russell, a keen sportsman, in a violation 
of a little local ordinance.  An information was laid, and the magistrates 
had no alternative—a fine was imposed; and the Americans in court showed 
their sense of the meanness of the motives which dictated the prosecution by 
instantly offering to unite in paying the fine.  They may be quite sure that 
Englishmen, if they remember the first part of the affair, will do so only 
for the sake of the pleasure of remembering the second.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">During</hi> the coming winter America is destined to be 
the theatre of many stirring events.  The expiry of the unhealthy season for 
which M'Clellan and Fremont wait on the Potomac and the Mississippi will be 
the signal for letting loose upon Mexico the fleets of the three leading 
nations of Western Europe.  Seldom was an armed intervention more imperiously 
called for.The British case against Mexico is only too complete.  The 
misgivings which could not be suppressed in the minds of many concerning the 
justifiableness of our late intervention in the affairs of China do not and 
cannot exist in the present instance.  Those most inclined to dispute the 
justice or deny the policy of high-handed proceedings on our part towards 
other nations refuse to become the advocates of Mexico.  British residents 
plundered at pleasure and murdered with impunity at the rate of a score a 
year, British creditors not only systematically defrauded of their rights 
but robbed even of a small instalment of pecuniary justice which had been 
placed under the protection of the Legation itself, the faith of treaties 
and special conventions so consistently flouted as to make further 
negotiation a mockery, and the fact that these wrongs were perpetuated 
not by one party merely, but by all of the more than semi-barbarous factions 
which dispute for an ephemeral sway in the "halls of Montezuma," furnish a 
catalogue of grievances such as, happily, is not often presented for the 
consideration of a British Cabinet.  Neither of our proposed co-partners 
in this expedition has so many claims for redress.  Some of the British 
claims date back to 1834, but France seized Vera Cruz in 1838, and obtained 
600,000 dollars in payment of all demands to that date,  She has likewise 
obtained several "conventions" since that time—conventions to which more 
respect has probably been shown than to those which the offending State 
has entered into with Great Britain.  Whatever other outrages Spain may 
have to allege, it is certain Spaniards have not advanced to the Mexican 
Government £12,000,000, and that their claims for injuries received 
do not amount to anything like the enormous sum of 21,000,000 dollars; 
indeed, the British merchants, whose petition stimulated our Government 
into action, hint very broadly that the life and property of an Englishman 
in Mexico are held cheaper by the natives than those of any other people in
 the world.</p>
<p>The astonished public may well ask why things have been suffered to come 
to this pass? why outrage has been heaped upon outrage, and nothing been 
avenged? why the national honour has been allowed to suffer in the eyes 
of our own citizens and of the rest of the world?  What an empty boast 
seems that <hi rend="italic">Romanus civis</hi> declaration of Lord Palmerston
 when put in apposition with the history of British transactions with the 
first of Spanish American Republics!  It is manifestly inconsistent for the
 Government to bombard Athens in behalf of Don Pacifico; to exact redress for
 a single Englishman cut down by an Austrian saber in a Tuscan city; to obtain
 compensation for two English engineers taken on board the filibustering 
steamer Cagliari; and leave unavenged a hundred cases worse than any of these 
which have happened in Mexico.  In Europe and the Orient the British 
Government have been acting on Roman principles; in America they seem to 
have taken to heart the doctrines of the Sermon on the Mount in their 
literal sense, and to have presented their cheek to the smiter.  Again, it
 may be asked, whence this incongruity?</p>
<p>The mystery is easily dispelled.  We find the solution in the former policy of
 the United States' Government.  The Cabinet of Washington have said 
"Hands off!"  whenever a British or Spanish intervention was threatened.  
The United States have acted as the great protectors of anarchy in Mexico. 
 The arrogant "Monroe doctrine," to the effect that no European Power shall 
wield influence in the Western World, has been jealously enforced against 
Britain and Spain in favour of Mexico.  The Mexican anarchs have not been slow 
to appreciate the advantages of their position and to indulge in license where 
that license could only be chastised at the fearful price of a war with the
 United States.  The wrongs which British residents and creditors have 
received at the hands of Mexicans, heavy as they are, were trifles compared 
with the consequences of letting loose upon British America those 500,000 
volunteers who are now arrayed in hostile camps on the Potomac, the Ohio, 
and the Mississippi.  This consideration bade our Government pause.  It was 
doubtless good policy to suffer meekly; our predominant interests demanded 
it; but it is impossible to overlook the fact that, in so acting, we have 
sacrificed the national honour to the national interest.  We need hardly 
add that in protecting ruffianism in Mexico the United States Government 
and people have been actuated by no kindly motives towards Mexico.  She 
has been their "sick man," and held the same position towards them that 
Poland in the latter half of the eighteenth, and Turkey in the former part 
of this century, occupied in respect to Russia.  Indeed this analogy has 
often been suggested as one of the mysterious bonds which linked so strangely
 together the great serf empire of the East and the great Slave Republic of
 the West.  Little Poland, however, only afforded food for three partitions.  
The original gigantic proportions of Mexico (including as they did Texas, New
 Mexico, and California) gave material for two annexations, and still left 
enough for two or three repetitions of the process.  Such a monster could 
not be swallowed whole.  It was necessary for the anaconda to rest awhile 
and digest.  In the meantime, and before any action has been taken on Mr. 
Buchanan's proposition of occupying the frontier provinces of their 
neighbour, the anaconda itself is severed into two parts:  the protector is 
occupied at home with internecine quarrels, quarrels which suggest the idea 
that, in appropriating portions of Mexican territory, he had himself become 
assimilated somewhat to the Mexican in character, and the anarchs suddenly 
find themselves at the mercy of those they have so long injured with impunity.
  For this long-desired opportunity we may safely acknowledge our indebtedness
 to the politicians of the cotton States, and credit them with it as a small
 set-off against the serious injury with which their hotheaded policy has
 already visited, and the still worse calamities with which it threatens to 
visit, the manufacturing classes of Europe.  Busily occupied as the United
 States are, we already hear the Anglo-French-Spanish expedition politely 
characterised as "an unholy combination," "an unnatural alliance"—words 
which issue with bad grace from the lips of those who have just warmly 
applauded the sentiment of the Czar of Russia that Russia and the United 
States, "placed at the extremities of two worlds, both in the ascending 
periods of their development, appear called to a natural community of 
interests and of sympathies, of which they have already given mutual proofs 
to each other."</p>
<p>   The fact that the expedition is to be a joint one causes some regrets 
of another kind at home.  The combination is not denounced as "unholy," but 
is pronounced "unpleasant."  Joint-stock operations with France are said to 
result in the disadvantage and discredit of this country.  We cannot so 
interpret the memorable passages in modern history to which allusion is made. 
 Did Anglo-French co-operation against Russia terminate in an unsatisfactory 
peace?  More recently, did the same combination so terminate in the case of 
China?  In both cases the triumph was achieved in a comparatively short space
 of time.  It is true that the army and navy of the two countries do feel a 
little mutual repulsion; but this consideration is a trifling one, and cannot
 be allowed to stand in the way of great measures of public policy demanded by
 the industrial spirit of the age in which we live.  That the dominant 
tendencies of this century urge upon both the French and the British nations 
a cordial and frequent co-operation we cannot doubt.  There was an invasion 
panic in England in 1852.  Armies and fleets were reviewed in mutual distrust,
 if not defiance, on each side of the Channel.  The superficial public opinion
 of the hour marked out those armaments as destined to be used against each 
other.  But the progress of events threw irony on these speculations.  The 
forces of the two nations were destined to fight side by side in the Crimea, 
the Black Sea, and the Baltic.  Again; since 1858 the invasion panic has 
become almost endemic here; the two nations, it is said, have been arming 
against each other.  Nevertheless, the voice of the mercantile community in 
China urged upon the home Governments the expediency of a joint war in that 
quarter of the globe, and the forces of the two nations again fought side by 
side; and, lastly, a similar demand from a similar class arises in reference 
to Mexico.  The merchants urgently recommend a <hi rend="italic">joint</hi>  
expedition as the best means of effecting the righteous object they have in 
view.  In our querulousness at the Anglo-French alliance let us beware that we 
are not kicking against the highest tendencies and the most radical requirements
 of our generation.</p>
<p>   It is no drawback if Spain should be added to the combination.  This is 
not the first time that England, France, and Spain have acted in unison on 
American questions.  Cuba has been preserved to Spain these ten years by 
an Anglo-French guarantee.  It is well, moreover, for the cause of Western 
civilization that out Teutonic and Protestant nation should be drawn closer 
to its Latin and Catholic neighbours.  The policy of isolation has endured 
long enough, and has cost Western Europe many calamities.  The same principle 
which in industrial pursuits gives birth to joint-stock companies and 
co-operative stores, and in social life to associations of all kinds unknown 
to our forefathers, forces upon us, sometimes it may be in spite of ourselves, 
the adoption of an analogous course in the elevated region of diplomacy and 
international politics.  Combined action has this additional advantage in that
 it affords less ground for the suspicion that the enterprise begun with 
laudable motives be prosecuted for the baser purpose of  selfish aggrandisement.
   It is rumoured that Spain, inflamed by her success in Morocco and by the
 windfall of St. Domingo, is meditating the revival of the projects of Hernando
 Cortez.  Association with Britain and France will impose moderation on the 
vaulting ambition of Iberian statesmen and will be a guarantee to the rest of 
the world that the original purpose of the expedition will be sincerely and 
scrupulously adhered to.  "The age of conquest is over," says Napoleon III., 
and nothing is a surer sign of the truth of this aphorism than the prevalence
 of  associated action for the settlement of international difficulties, and 
the discredit into which an isolated and individualistic policy is falling.</p>
<p>   "There is many a slip between the cup and the lip," and it is by no 
means impossible that France and Spain may act independently of Great Britain.
The British merchants prayed for the occupation of the city of Mexico by a
 small force of European troops.  This idea is said to find favour with the 
French Government, with whom a fondness for "occupations" is
traditional. If 
that Government have troops they are willing to "expend" in Mexico, it is not 
the British residents who will object to their presence.  But Earl Russell sets 
his face against implicating this country in this course.  He thinks a very 
large force would be insufficient to restore public tranquility.  Foreign 
interference of this kind is only beneficial when a large and numerous party 
in the country is prepared to welcome foreign aid.  There is no such party in 
Mexico.  The British Government will therefore confine itself to demanding 
"respect for the persons and property of British subjects, and the fulfillment
 of recorded obligations."  Such is the argument of the British Foreign
 Secretary.  It is easy to see that the "fulfillment of recorded obligations" 
may be ensured by the administration of the customs of Vera Cruz and the 
other ports of Mexico, and the application of the moneys to those creditors 
to whom by special treaty they are due; but how the British Government 
propose to make good their demand for the "respect of the persons and 
property of British subjects" resident in the interior is not so clear. 
 Already we are warned by the Europeans in the interior towns of Mexico 
that, if the military operations are confined to the coast, their position 
will be rendered more precarious than ever.  The natives, unable to oppose 
the foreigner on the coast, will, we are told, avenge themselves on the 
defenceless foreigners in their midst.  These appeals are worthy of 
consideration, and may lead Earl Russell to consent to the desired occupation.
  In the meantime we bespeak for the Mexican expedition, whether joint or 
several, the favour of the English public.  It will sail in the interest of
order, <choice><reg>civilization</reg><orig>civilisation</orig></choice>, and humanity, and will 
vindicate the national honour and prestige in a part of the world where it 
has long been suffered to droop.  It will rehabilitate the legitimate influence
 of Europe in the Western World, and confound the pretensions of the partisans
 of the Monroe doctrine.  It may, indeed, help Mr. Gladstone's very small margin
 of estimated surplus to disappear; but England has so long allowed pecuniary 
considerations to override those of honour in her relations with Mexico that 
she may consider herself fortunate in being able at the present juncture to 
renew her credit there at a small immediate outlay.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Confederates having evacuted Munson's-hill, 
and other positions before Washington, they have been occupied, as previously 
reported, by the Federals as far as Lewinsville.  A great part of the defences
 of the Confederates were make-believe, painted logs for guns, and so forth.  
The scene at the top of the hill, in the earthwork itself, was (says one 
account) one of the most amusing that could be imagined.  Everybody was 
laughing.  The utter absurdity of the works as means of defence, their 
smallness, meanness, insignificance, touched everybody's sense of the ludicrous.
  The inclosure comprises about four acres, around which earth is roughly 
thrown up to a height of perhaps four feet.  Of course there is no ditch, 
no glacis—nothing, in fact, to give it the character of a fortification of any 
kind.  It is not even regular in form, but coils loosely and waveringly about 
the ground, as a huge snake might enfold it.  In every respect it looks a 
squirmy piece of work.  There are no embrasures for guns, but upon two of 
its projections are mounted—what? guns?  No, indeed, but old logs, with a 
black circle painted in the centre of the sawed part to represent a formidable
 armament.  At such a distance as that of Bailey's—roads the deception might 
very easily have remained undetected.  In the middle of this wretched "fort" 
the remains of a hastily-constructed hut still stood, but, with the exception 
of a few trees, it contained nothing else.  Behind it, on the slope of the hill,
 were a group of irregular shanties, thrown together for the protection of 
troops.  Their number was sufficient for the accommodation of about one 
regiment—certainly not more.</p>
<p> Our special Artist has sent us three Sketches, herewith engraved, in 
connection with the advance of the Federalists on Munson's-hill.  At the

  <p> By the steamer City of Washington we have received New York journals to 
the 18th ult., and a short telegram from Cape Race to the 22nd.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The report of the discomforture of the Federal blockading squadron off New 
Orleans is not believed by the Navy Department at Washington.  It is, however, 
reiterated with greater circumstantiality in the following despatch of  
Commander Hollins, of the Confederate States' Navy:-</p>
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Fort Jackson</hi>, Oct. 12.—Last night I attacked the blockaders with my little fleet.
  I succeeded after a very short struggle in driving them all aground in the 
South-west Pass Bar, except the Preble, which I sunk.  I captured a prize from
 them, and after they were fast in the sand I peppered them well.  There were 
no casualities on our side.  It was a complete success.</q>
<p rend="right">(Signed)    HOLLINS.</p>

<p>A dispatch from New Orleans, dated the 13th, says the force of the Federal 
fleet was 40 guns and nearly 1000 men, while the Confederate fleet was 16 guns 
and 300 men.</p>
<p>   The great naval expedition which has been preparing at New York and 
Boston for some weeks will rendezvous at Annapolis, on the Chesapeake, and 
take on board there its last quota of troops and artillery.  Among the 
transports attached to this expedition are the finest steamers of the late 
Collins and Vanderbilt lines.</p>
<p>   The Federal Commodore who allowed the Nashville to escape from Charleston 
with the Southern Commissioners has been superseded.</p>
<p>   A force of Confederates was landed on Santa Rosa Island, off Pensacola, 
and stormed the encampment of a New York regiment stationed there.  They 
destroyed all the tents, captured a large amount of rations, stores, and 
ammunition, and spiked all the guns placed in position.</p>
<p>   Detailed accounts of the Confederate assault on the encampment on  
Hatteras Inlet show that the loss suffered by the Confederates was much 
exaggerated.  The Monticello shelled and sunk two of the retiring bateaux, 
"containing, it is judged, about fifty men each."</p>
<p>   On the Potomac General M'Clellan advances but slowly.  The Confederates 
have evacuated Vienna, destroyed the railroad, and fallen back on Fairfax 
Court House.  Two English officers who were present at the review of 
M'Clellan's artillery and cavalry on the 8th ult report "the artillery fair, 
horses light; batteries rather a mixture, longs and shorts, rifled and 
smooth bores; carriages heavy, harness not well kept nor clean, but strong 
and serviceable; men strong and serviceable too, but not well set up; 
headdress condemned.  Report on cavalry not so favourable.  Men don't ride; 
no seats, no setting up, nothing clean; horses rather mixed; saddlery  and 
equipments—including swords, scabbards, spurs, bits, and metalwork—generally 
very dirty.  As to bone and sinew, the men are good as can be;  the impression 
is, however, that they could not be relied on to stand or to make a charge in 
their present condition, and that they would do more harm than good if any 
attempt were made to handle them in the field."</p>
<p>   On the Upper Potomac, where Generals Stone and Banks are in command, 
there has been some fighting.  In the first engagement the Confederates 
retreated with the loss of one gun.  On the second occasion 1800 Federals 
crossed the Potomac at Edward's Ferry, and marched in the direction of 
Leesburg, near which he[sic] was met by a large force of Confederates, who repulsed 
him[sic].</p>
<p>   In Western Virginia the state of the roads is already such as to forbid 
the idea of further campaigning for the present.  General Rosencranz, in 
command of the Federals, had fallen back within six miles of  Gawley Bridge, 
on the Upper Kanawha.  The enemy, under General Lee, were encamped twenty-six 
miles to the south-east.  Both armies are in want of the means of transport.</p>
<p>   The opposing armies have not yet come into collision on the soil of 
Kentucky.  Reinforcements are arriving to both sides.  Ex-Vice-President Breckenridge is rousing the people of Eastern Kentucky to resist the Northern 
invaders.</p>
<p>   In Western Missouri General Price, with 20,000 troops, has made  a stand 
near Osceola.  General Fremont was following him.  A body of 5000 Confederates
 has been defeated at Fredericktown in this State.</p>
<p>   Mr. Cameron, the Secretary of War, has visited Fremont's headquarters to
 judge for himself how matters were going on.  Before leaving St. Louis he 
ordered General Fremont to discontinue, as unnecessary, his fieldworks around 
the city, and that which he was erecting at Jefferson City; to suspend work on 
the barracks for his bodyguard; to let his debts in St. Louis, amounting to
 4,500,000 dollars, remain unpaid until they can be properly examined, and to 
allow none but the regular disbursing officers to disburse the funds.  General
 Fremont was informed that the officers appointed by him without the knowledge 
of the President, numbering over two hundred, would not be paid.  It is 
supposed, from the tenor of this order, that General Fremont will be removed 
or compelled to resign.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGNERS.</p>

<p>   The following semi-official announcement has been made from Washington:—
"First, no one has been authorised to enlist or raise troops in Canada.  
Second, no commissions have been offered nor other overtures made to military 
men in France or other European States.  Third, the Government has not tendered
 the command of the army to General Garibaldi.  What is true?  First, that 
every foreigner  who has come with a good character and credentials and offered
 his services to the Government in support of the Union has been accepted, and 
no other is in the military employment of the United States.  Second, General 
Garibaldi being a naturalised citizen, it was reported to the Government by 
one of our Consuls that the General was contemplating a visit to this country, 
and had intimated conditionally  a disposition to engage in the service of the
 United States.  He was informed, if this were the case, his services would be 
accepted with pleasure, and he would receive a commission as Brigadier-General,
 the same rank which was conferred on General Lafayette in the war of the 
Revolution.  General Garibaldi, upon consideration of the subject, has 
concluded not to offer his services at present, but thinks he may by-and-by 
visit the United States."</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S CIRCULAR LETTER.</p>

<p>   The Secretary of State has sent a letter to the Governors of the loyal 
States calling upon them to adopt measures for defending the coasts.  This 
letter is conceived in these terms:—</p>
<p rend="right">Department of State, Washington,
Oct. 14.</p>                   
<p>Sir,—The present insurrection had not even revealed 
itself in arms when disloyal citizens hastened to foreign countries to invoke
 their intervention for the overthrow of the Government and the destruction 
of the Federal Union.  These agents are known to have made their appeals to 
some of the more important States without success.  It is not likely, however,
 that they will remain content with such refusals.  Indeed, it is understood 
that they are industriously endeavouring to accomplish their disloyal purposes
 by degrees and by indirection.  Taking advantage of the embarrassments of 
agriculture, manufacture, and commerce in foreign countries, resulting from 
the insurrection they have inaugurated at home, they seek to involve our 
common country in controversies with States with which every public interest
 and every interest of mankind require that it shall remain in relations of 
peace, amity, and friendship.  I am able to state for your satisfaction that
 the prospect of any such disturbance is now less serious than it has been at
 any previous period during the course of the insurrection.  It is, 
nevertheless, necessary now, as it has hitherto been, to take every precaution 
that is possible to avoid the evils of foreign war to be superinduced upon 
those of civil commotion which we are endeavouring to cure.</p>
<p>   One of the most obvious of such precautions is that our ports and 
harbours on the seas and lakes should be put in a condition of complete 
defence, for any nation may be said voluntarily to incur danger in tempestuous 
seasons when it fails to show that it has sheltered itself on every side from 
which the storm might possibly come.</p>
<p>   The measures which the Executive can adopt in this emergency are such 
only as Congress has sanctioned and for which it has provided.</p>
<p>   The President is putting forth the most diligent efforts to execute 
these measures, and we have the great satisfaction of seeing that these efforts 
are seconded by the favour, aid, and support of a loyal, patriotic, and 
self-sacrificing people, who are rapidly bringing the military and naval 
forces of the United States into the highest state of efficiency.</p>
<p>   But Congress was chiefly absorbed during its recent extra Session with 
those measures, and did not provide as amply as could be wished for the 
fortification of our sea and lake coasts.  In previous wars the loyal States 
have applied themselves by independent and separate activity to the support 
and aid of the Federal Government in its arduous responsibilities.  The same 
disposition has been manifested in a degree eminently honourable by all the 
loyal States during the present insurrection.  In view of this fact, and 
relying upon the increase and continuance of the same disposition on the part 
of the loyal States, the President has directed me to invite your 
consideration to the subject of the improvement and perfection of the 
defences of the State over which you preside, and to ask you to submit the 
subject to the consideration of the Legislature when it shall have assembled.
  Such proceedings by the State would require only a temporary use of its means.
  The expenditures ought to be made the subject of conferences with the Federal
 Government.  Being thus made with the concurrence of the Government for general
 defence, there is every reason to believe that Congress would sanction what 
the State would do, and would provide for its reimbursement.  </p>
<p>   Should these suggestions be accepted, the President will direct the 
proper agents of the Federal Government to confer with you, and to superintend, 
direct, and conduct the prosecution of the system of defence of your State.</p>
<p>   I have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,    W. H. SEWARD.</p>

<p>American public opinion is at a loss to know what is the immediate cause of 
this panicstruck epistle.  The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> attributes
 it to the European intervention in Mexico, which the Federal Government would,
 in certain eventualities, oppose with all its power.</p>

<p rend="center">LORD LYONS'S PROTEST.</p>

<p>   The British Ambassador has protested against the arbitrary confinement of
 British subjects, alleging that the authority of Congress was necessary for 
such measures.</p>
<p>   Mr. Seward replies to the effect that in the present emergency all 
classes of society alike must cheerfully acquiesce in the measures which the 
safety of the people demand, and that the British Government would hardly 
expect the President to accept their explanation of the Constitution of the 
United States.</p>
<p>   The New York <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi>, a journal of
 good authority, avers that the personal relations between Mr. Seward and Lord 
Lyons are far from friendly.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

 <p>  The telegraph line which is to connect New York and San Francisco has 
been opened to Utah City in its eastward progress.</p>
 <p>   The Commissioners of the World's Fair have <choice><reg>organized</reg><orig>organised</orig></choice> themselves by electing Secretary Seward chairman, and Census 
Commissioner Kennedy secretary.  A committee was appointed to wait on the 
President, with a request that he would send a national vessel to England to 
convey such goods as American contributors may desire to exhibit.</p>
<p>The New York banks have offered for the third 50,000,000 dollars of the 
Federal loan, and for 100,000,000 dollars of Seven per Cent Bonds.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Duke of Argyll was entertained at a grand 
banquet in Inverary yesterday week by his tenantry.  The banquet was held in 
the Argyll Arms Hotel—the Rev. Colin Smith, D.D., in the chair.  The formal
 toasts having been disposed of, the chairman, in an eulogistic speech, 
proposed the health of their noble guest, which was most enthusiastically 
responded to.</p>
<p>   The most important statements in the speech of his Grace came in at the 
close, when, having discoursed on agriculture and the causes of its prosperity,
 he referred to causes which throw a gloom over manufacturing prospects—the 
effects of the civil war on the other side of the Atlantic.  On this subject 
the Duke made these weighty statements:-</p>
<p>   "I see that there has been some fear expressed lately that the 
inconvenience which is likely to arise in this country from the contest in 
America is so great that there will be a pressure put upon the Government 
to interfere in that contest, or at least to take some steps which may 
ultimately involve us in it.  I have too high an opinion of the good sense 
and of the public principle of the people of the country to believe that any 
such pressure will be put upon the Government; and I must add, that I have 
too great confidence in the firmness and public principle of the Government 
and Parliament of this country to believe that they will be willing to submit 
to such pressure if it were put upon them.  It is our absolute duty, I need 
hardly tell you, to remain entirely neutral in that contest, and not only is 
it our duty to remain neutral as regards action, but I think it is to a very 
great extent our duty even to abstain from offering advice, though it might 
be conceived in a kind and friendly spirit.  No good whatever can arise from 
offering such advice as that, for example, which was lately offered—I have 
no doubt with the best intentions—by the Emperor of Russia to the contending 
parties in America.  The answer which the Americans will infallibly give 
to any such interference will, however civilly expressed, virtually amount 
to this—"We are much obliged to you for your kind advice.  We have no doubt
 that it is conceived in the best spirit and with the best intentions; but 
there is a general rule in this world that every man should attend to his own
 affairs.  And there is this additional reason for doing so in the present 
case, that it is quite evident that you don't understand ours."  That is 
the answer which, virtually, the Americans have actually given, and which, 
I am convinced, they will continue to give to all such counsel.  Because, 
after all, the truth is this, that mere general advice to compose their 
differences, without any specific suggestion as to the terms upon which 
those differences are to be adjusted, is always held by the Americans to
 imply indirectly, even though it be not intended, that the objects for 
which they are contending are either unworthy or at least trivial and 
unimportant.</p>
<p>   "Now, whatever we may think of that contest, in fairness to our 
American friends we ought to admit that no more tremendous issues were ever 
submitted to the dread arbitrement of war than those which are now submitted
 to it upon the American continent.  I do not care whether we look at it from 
the Northern or from the Southern point of view.  Take the mere question of 
what is called the right of secession.  I know of no Government which has ever
 existed in the world that could possibly have admitted the right of 
secession from its own allegiance.  There is a curious animal in Loch Fine 
which I have sometimes dredged up from the bottom of the sea, and which 
performs the most extraordinary, innocent, and able acts of suicide and 
self-destruction.  It is a peculiar kind of starfish, which, when brought 
up from the bottom of the water, and when any attempt is made to take hold of 
it, immediately throws off all its arms—its very centre breaks up, and nothing
 remains of one of the most beautiful forms of nature but a thousand wriggling
 fragments.  Such, undoubtedly, would have been the fate of the American Union
 if its Government had admitted what is called the right of secession.  
Gentlemen, I think we ought to admit, in fairness to the Americans, that there
 are some things worth fighting for, and that national existence is one of 
these.  And then, gentlemen, if we go to the South—if we look at the matter 
from the Southern point of view, difficult as it may be for us to do so—I 
must say also that I am not surprised at their conduct.  If they believe—as 
they loudly proclaim they do believe—that slavery is not an evil which is to
 be tolerated only and brought to an end as soon as possible, but a Divine 
institution for the benefit of mankind, to be maintained, and, if possible,
 extended, and which, if it is assailed even in a single outpost, must be 
defended to the death; then, even though the citadel of slavery be not 
assailed, but only an important outwork, it is but natural that the South 
should rise in its defence.  But, of course, in this as in all other 
revolutions, those who take part in them must be judged finally by the moral 
verdict of mankind upon the justice of the cause which they have risen to 
assert.  But, whatever may be our private sympathies, we, as a nation, must 
take no part whatever in the contest.  Most earnestly do we trust and pray 
that it may be brought to a speedy end; yet I confess that there is another
 wish which, I think, in our mind ought to stand even before this one, and 
that is, the wish that the end of this war, whenever it does come—be it soon
 or late—may be such as shall be worth the sacrifice and the cost—such as 
 shall tend to the <choice><reg>civilization</reg><orig>civilisation</orig></choice> of the world,
 and promote the cause of human freedom."</p>
<p>   Several other toasts appropriate to the occasion were proposed and 
responded to in the course of the evening.</p>

 <p>  The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has relieved the Courts of 
England, France, and Spain from embarrassment.  They had desired to take 
certain steps in reference to Mexico, and, indeed, had made all preparations 
for the expedition, but there was a delay and a hesitation which are now 
accounted for.  By the last mails came a number of the <hi rend="italic">
Herald</hi>, in which is contained the gracious permission for which the 
three Powers had been waiting.  The journal says, "We see no objection to 
the united action of England, France, and Spain in this matter."  All 
difficulty is now over; and, Mr. Bennett having graciously permitted Lord
 Palmerston, the Emperor, and Marshal O'Donnell to act, the expedition 
sails immediately.  But it is right to add that Spain is cautioned against 
taking any isolated action of her own, and is informed that if she makes 
any attempt towards the conquest of Mexico the North will immediately declare
 war upon her.  It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Marshal will at once 
dispach a grandee of the first class to call at the office of the 
<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> (north-west corner of Fulton and Nassau 
Streets, New York—but what need to mention the locale of the 
<hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> or of the Great Pyramid?) and explain that 
nothing of the kind will be attempted.  The other news from America is 
less satisfactory.  There are renewed rumours of engagements, but of their
 importance or of their issues we have no coherent information.</p>
<p>   With casualties, unless they present some special feature connecting
 them with larger questions, we do not deal; nor is our recurrence to a
 recent fearful event in America an exception to our rule.  The hideous story
 of the burning of several unfortunate young ladies who were engaged in the 
business of a theatre in Philadelphia is not likely to be forgotten; but it 
may as well be forgotten unless it produces a result here.  In London alone 
there are some five-and-twenty places of amusement open every night, and a 
similar accident might occur at any one of them.  Managers are largely and 
generously befriended by the press: shortcomings are overlooked, and merits
 are praised to the very full of their deserts; and the press has ample right 
of appeal to the directors of our places of entertainment.  We therefore ask,
 and shall gladly hear, though we hardly expect, replies in the affirmative. 
 Is there, in any of the London theatres, a provision against fire on the 
stage? and, if so, is that provision kept in order, and are the servants of 
the theatre <choice><reg>familiarized</reg><orig>familiarised</orig></choice> with it? </p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Beauregard and M'Clellan</hi>—The following comparison is drawn by the 
<hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent between the Federal and Confederate
 Commanders-in-Chief, who were old fellow-students and classmates:—"To my mind 
there is something of resemblance between the men.  Both are below the middle 
height.  They are both squarely built, and famed for muscular power since their
 college days.  Beauregard, indeed, is lean and thin-ribbed; M'Clellan is full 
and round, with a Napoleonic tendency to <hi rend="italic">embonpoint</hi>, 
subdued by incessant exercise.  Beauregard sleeps little; M'Clellan's 
temperament requires a full share of rest; both are spare and Spartan in diet,
 studious, quiet.  Beauregard is rather saturnine, and, if not melancholic, 
is of a grim gaiety; M'Clellan is genial, even in his reserve.  The density 
of the hair, the squareness of the jaw, the firmness and regularity of the 
teeth, and the outlines of the features are points of similarity in both, 
which would be more striking if Beauregard were not of the true Louisianian 
creole tint, while M'Clellan is fair-complexioned.  Beauregard has a dark, 
dull, student's eye, the dulness of which arises, however, from its formation, 
for it is full of fire, and its glances are quick and searching.  M'Clellan 
has a deep, clear eye, into which you can look far and deep, while you feel 
its searches far and deep into you.  Beauregard has something of pretension 
in his manner—not hauteur, but a folding-armed, meditative sort of air, which
 seems to say, "Don't disturb me; I'm thinking of military movements."  
M'Clellan seems to be always at leisue; but you feel at the same time you ought 
not to intrude too much upon him, even when you seek in vain for the grounds 
of that impression in anything that he is doing or saying.  Beauregard is 
more subtle, crafty, and astute; M'Clellan is more comprehensive, more 
learned, more impressionable.  Beauregard is a thorough soldier; M'Clellan 
may prove he is a great General.  The former only looks to military 
consequences, and disregards popular manifestations; the latter respects 
the opinions of the outer world, and sees political as well as military 
results in what he orders.  They are both the creatures of accident, so 
far as their present positions are concerned.  It remains to be seen if 
either can control the current of events, and if in either the artilleryman 
or the cavalry officer of the old United States' army there is the stuff 
around which history is moulded, such as that of which the artilleryman of 
Brienne or the leader of the Ironsides was made."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the incidental benefits likely to result 
from the civil war in America, as some compensation for the incalculable evils
 it inflicts, we are not without hope that a revision of belligerent rights
 will be one.  Much of what the world now accepts as international law with 
 regard to them is unsuited to modern <choice><reg>civilization</reg><orig>civilisation</orig></choice>.  Take the right of blockade, for instance, as it is being illustrated 
in the unhappy contest between the Northern and Southern States of the great 
American Republic.  The right is held, and no doubt justly held, to be in 
perfect conformity with the law of nations.  But the instincts of mankind 
will infallibly teach them that the instrument of coercion which cannot be 
applied to crush the rebellious without at the same time exposing to equal 
damage the rights and interests of millions innocent of the smallest wrong 
ought not to be left in the hands of any Power.  It is hard that because the
 Confederate States have renounced their allegiance to the Union, and are 
strong enough to maintain their separate independence for months, and perhaps
 for years, large departments of manufacturing industry in England and France,
 upon which the subsistence of millions depend, should be visited with a 
calamity little short of destruction.  The mischief done by privateering, which
 the great Powers of Europe have agreed to abolish, is as nothing compared 
with the wholesale suffering which the blockade now being enforced by the 
Federal Government is causing to nations not in the least implicated in the 
pending quarrel.  We do not dispute the fact that the Federal Government is 
only availing itself of what all other Governments have insisted upon as a 
belligerent right.  We should be the last to suggest that we should be 
justified, in the present instance, in breaking the blockade merely because 
we happen to be the chief victim of its enforcement.  We must make up our
 minds to bear with patience and dignity the evils which a bad law we have 
been foremost in sustaining has unexpectedly brought upon ourselves.  But we
 do trust that the severe hardship which has overtaken us will open our eyes
 to the essential injustice of this belligerent right, and dispose us to take
 such steps as will preclude the chance of any similar visitation in future.</p>
<p>   It is too true, we fear, that we owe our present helpless position in 
regard to the blockade mainly, if not exclusively, to the policy of our own 
statesmen.  When the Government of the United States was invited, at the close
 of the Russian War, to agree to the article of  the Treaty of Paris which 
abolishes privateering, the Secretary of State, in declining that proposition 
on the ground of the obvious disadvantage at which it would place the American 
Government in relation to other maritime Powers, submitted a counter proposal,
 unless our memory greatly deceives us, which would have placed the entire 
commercial marine of all countries beyond the range of international 
hostilities.  If that project had found favour with the Governments of Europe 
the right of blockade  would have been applicable only against vessels of war,
 and goods contraband of war;  and the only obstruction to the usual flow of 
cotton to this country would have existed in the determination of the Southern 
States not to sell it—a determination which high prices and the prospect of 
raising up rival producers in other parts of the world  very surely and very
 speedily have overborne.  England alone, we believe, opposed to this 
reasonable and liberal proposition insuperable objections, and England is now
 fated to endure the heaviest penalty in consequence of the short-sightedness
 of her international policy.  In our too great anxiety to retain a weapon of
 offence which we could wield with better effect than any other Power we 
unconsciously hung up a scourge for our own backs, and we are now smarting 
under its infliction.</p>
<p>The unfortunate decision at which we then arrived was owing, probably, to 
our having limited our view of the evils of war to the injuries which 
belligerents are capable of doing to each other.  It was thought at the time, 
and powerfully argued, that Great Britain, the most formidable of the maritime
 Powers, would gratuitously fling away her sharpest weapon by acceding to 
Mr. Marcy's proposition; that, being at the expense of keeping afloat a great 
naval armament, it would prove comparatively useless, in case of hostilities, 
unless she could avail herself of it<pb n="464"/> to strike a blow at the 
commerce of her enemy; and that the mere fact of her retaining the right 
and the power of devastating the commercial marine of any country with which
 she might chance to be at war would tend to the preservation of peace by 
compelling other nations to be cautious of embroiling themselves with her.  
It was not foreseen, or not sufficiently considered, how this determination 
would bear upon neutrals.  It seems not to have entered into the mind of any
 one that, without being ourselves at war with the United States, our own 
excessive jealousy in upholding our naval supremacy might involve us in 
miseries almost as intolerable as those of actual warfare.  We were unwilling 
to see the commercial navy of any contingent foe withdrawn by previous
 arrangement from the reach of that arm in the strength of which we place
 our chief reliance; and, in refusing to forego our advantage in this 
respect, we retained, of course, the right of blockade.  But it is as a 
neutral, not a belligerent, Power that the evil consequences of our own 
decision have come home to us.  We have sided with neither of the contending
 parties in America—we have carefully abstained from giving just cause of 
offence to either of them; but we owe it to our own deliberate decision that, 
in their quarrel the one with the other, our cotton interests are being crushed
 as between the upper and the nether millstones.</p>
<p>Such being the circumstances, there would seem to be no alternative in the 
present case but to bear as best we may the calamity we have indirectly brought
 upon ourselves.  We must manfully abide by the results of the exercise by 
others of the belligerent rights we have insisted upon for ourselves.  We hope 
that her Majesty's Government will loyally and to the end preserve the 
neutrality they have proclaimed; and that no temptation offered to them by 
the Confederate States, and no inconvenience entailed upon them by the action 
of the Federal Union, will prevail upon them to break the blockade, either 
alone or in concert with other European Powers.  The present distress may be 
great, but we had far better endure it patiently than expose ourselves to the
 charge of a breach of international morality.  Any departure from our present
 neutral position would be but purchasing immediate relief at the expense of 
future and much greater suffering.  We cannot take direct steps towards putting 
an end to the existing crisis without sowing the seeds of  enmities the bitter 
fruit of which we should be compelled to reap at no very remote hereafter.  We
 might, it is true, by recognising the South, put a speedy end to the present 
unnatural contest, and liberate the stores of cotton for which our manufactures 
are pining.  But our intervention to close the dispute whilst the passions of 
the disputants are yet hot and eager would but precipitate a war of one or both
 of them with ourselves.  The vast army now resting on the Potomac would 
probably seek employment in Canada, and the Federal States bereft of the 
territory which they held south of Washington, and that, too, partly by our 
agency, would infallibly turn to the North for compensation.  No, we must 
not interfere.  Cotton is precious, but the price paid for it may be too high.
  Tha alternative of neutrality is contingently such as may well</p>

<p rend="center">Make us rather bear the ills we have,<lb/>
Than fly to others that we know not of.</p>

<p>England now resembles a man who, having entered into an engagement and 
refused when opportunity offered to reconsider it, unexpectedly finds that it 
has an aspect of extreme inconvenience towards himself.  She is utterly 
precluded by all the obligations of national honour from seeking relief by 
practically dishonouring her own bond.  Her true policy lies in another 
direction.  She cannot get cotton from America without breaking open the doors 
which, as the law of nations now stands, are rightfully barred against her.  
She must reject every temptation to commit an international burglary, and 
resolutely look elsewhere for what she wants.  No doubt she will feel the 
pinch; but, having made up her mind to brave it, she will be the better
 prepared to use every legitimate appliance which will mitigate her sufferings.
  She is not destined, under any conceivable circumstances, to face the entire 
destruction of her cotton manufacture.  The very extremity of distress to which
 she seems to be exposed will attract to her markets all the disposable cotton
 which tropical climates can forward to her.  The strain which is put upon her
 will bear down most of the obstacles which have hitherto indisposed her to 
seek her supplies elsewhere.  Even from America some part of the crop which is 
locked up by the civil war may find its way hither whenever the Confederate 
States shall have arrived at the conviction that we have no intention of 
breaking the blockade, and that they are in danger of losing the monopoly of 
our markets.  The hope of <choice><reg>realizing</reg><orig>realising</orig></choice> high prices 
on the one hand and the fear of being permanently supplanted by India on the 
other will operate powerfully towards their discovery of some method by which 
to convey their produce to Europe.  The slave trade has never yet been put down
 on the western coast of Africa by blockading squadrons, and the cotton trade,
 no doubt, will be equally fertile in expedients and equally successful in 
partially evading or surmounting the difficulties by which it is beset.  The 
greater our efforts to render ourselves independent of the Confederate States 
for our supplies of cotton the more desperate will be their attempts to reach 
our markets.  Indeed, it is becoming a fair question whether even our 
immediate as well as our remoter interests may not be best subserved by our 
loyal and steadfast observance of belligerent rights.</p>
<p>The events of the last few months, however, have surely sufficed to 
demonstrate that the law of nations embodying these belligerent rights is 
altogether out of tune with the spirit and wants of modern 
 <choice><reg>civilization</reg><orig>civilisation</orig></choice>.  We trust the lesson which has 
been taught us will not have been thrown away.  War is now carried on under 
far different conditions than those which prevailed in olden times.  Armies 
are not now allowed to devastate private property in the countries in which 
they are engaged, nor is there any sound reason why navies should be permitted
 to do so at sea.  The interests of humanity equally demand the exemption of
 commerce from warlike liabilities.  But justice also demands it; for no one
 can pretend that the state of things which may involve the most vital interests
 of neutrals in every international dispute that may trouble the repose of the
 world is conformable with the first and most obvious principles of justice. 
 England has but to accept a more liberal doctrine to obtain for it universal
 recognition.  She is the first commercial nation in the world, and it would
 be as much to her interest as it would redound to her honour to place commerce
 beyond the lawful reach of international hostilities.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the arrival of the steamer North American we 
have advices to the evening of the 26th ult.  The most important event of the 
week has been the completion of the great continental telegraph line, uniting 
San Francisco with New York, and so with Cape Race, Newfoundland—a connected 
line of 6000 miles, and the longest in the world.  It was finished on the 25th
 ult., and a message exchanged between the Mayors of  San Francisco and New 
York.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>A battle has been fought on the Upper Potomac to the advantage of the 
Confederates.  On the 21st ult. the Federals, to the number of 1736, advanced
 upon Leesburg.  The Federals were commanded by General Stone and the 
Confederates by General Evans.  The former was eventually compelled to abandon 
the field and fall back across the Potomac with the loss of 600 men, including
 General Baker, killed.  Of these 400 are set down as "missing."  The 
retreating forces reached the river-bank about twenty minutes before nightfall.
  As there were no means of conveyance across the river, those who could swim 
plunged into the river, some carrying their arms and others throwing them away.
  Many were drowned.  The Federals were subsequently reinforced, and returned 
to the charge; but, on the approach of two strong columns of Confederates, 
again retreated into Maryland.  General Baker was Senator for Oregon, and an 
Englishman by birth.  He emigrated, when young, to Illinois and thence to 
California.  He was, we believe, the only Englishman who ever sat in the 
United States' Senate.</p>
<p>The Confederates have obtained the command of the Potomac from Quantico 
Creek to Chopowamsic Creek.  A crowd of small vessels employed in the 
commissary service of the Washingtonians are detained below the batteries, 
and fears are entertained that the supplies of forage for the 30,000 horses 
and mules in and around the capital will run short unless the batteries are 
silenced.</p>
<p>In Kentucky General Zollicoffer at the head of a body of the Confederates 
attacked General Gerard.  He was repulsed three times.  This skirmish is the 
first which has taken place on the soil of this State.</p>
<p>In Western Virginia the campaign is over for the season.  The Northerners 
hold the ground from Gauley River on the south, to Cheat Mountain on the east. 
 The Federals were suffering much from sickness in this now inclement region.</p>
<p>In Missouri, Lexington has been retaken by the Federals.  150 troops under 
General White surprised the garrison, numbering 300.  Only two pieces of cannon
 were found in the fort.  General Fremont is still said to be in pursuit of 
General Price.  General Fremont has not been removed from his command only 
because the influence of his name with the Western people is so great that 
the Cabinet fears lest his removal would damp the popular ardour for the war 
there and put a stop to recruiting.</p>
<p>The accounts of the Confederate attack on the Federals on Santa Rosa Island 
and on the blockading fleet off New Orleans were much exaggerated, especially 
the latter.  No vessel was destroyed or even damaged, and no man killed.  Some
 timber was destroyed and a transport laden with coal taken.</p>
<p>The great naval expedition, composed of 80 vessels, carrying 500 guns and 
between 30,000 and 40,000 men, would sail from Hampton, near Fortress Monroe,
 on the 27th ult., for some undisclosed point on the Southern coast.</p>
<p>The Southern Commissioners to England and France who ran the blockade at 
Charleston have arrived at Cardenas, in Cuba.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARREST OF BRITISH SUBJECTS.</p>

<p>In an important correspondence between Lord Lyons and Mr. Seward relative 
to the arrest, by order of the latter, of two British subjects, and the refusal
 on the part of the military authorities to recognise the writ of habeas
 corpus, Lord Lyons, in the name of the English Government, vehemently 
complains of this proceeding as being at variance with the ties of amity 
between the two countries and a violation of the American Constitution.  
Mr. Seward, in a lengthy reply, describes the circumstances under which the 
two British subjects in question were arrested, with a view to show that the 
Government were justified in regarding them as objects of suspicion, and that 
when their innocence was made apparent they were at once liberated.  Mr. Seward
 then defends the adoption of extreme measures on the ground of the exigencies 
of the country in a time of civil war, when battling for its existence, and
 with some sarcasm remarks that "the British Government will hardly expect that
 the President will accept their explanation of the Constitution of the United
 States."  Mr. Seward, at the same time, argues that the President has in no 
respect transcended his powers.</p>
<p>The Northern press, without exception, sustain Mr. Seward; but the
<hi rend="italic"> New York Tribune</hi> hopes that these extraordinary 
powers will be used as seldom as possible, and that the offender will in 
loyal districts be speedily brought to trial.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward's previous circular to the Governors calling on them to fortify
 their coasts is condemned by the moderate portion of the press as uncalled for.
  It caused a panic in the New York money market; Federal Six per Cents fell 
three per cent, and the popular subscriptions to the national loan dwindled to
 one half the previous amount.  The stocks have since recovered themselves,
 but the subscriptions to the loan continue to feel the effect of the panic.</p>
<p>Arms and munitions of war are arriving in New York from England and the
 Continent.  They are chiefly destined for the army of the west.  The
 Quartermaster-General having sent an agent to England to purchase 
£1,000,000 worth of clothing for the army, the New England manufacturers 
protested and declared that all purchases should be made at home.  The 
Quartermaster-General replied that his wants were urgent, and human life 
depended on an immediate supply, which could not be had at home, but that
 as little money should be disbursed abroad as possible.</p>
<p>The slave-traders have left the port of New York, where they find 
themselves watched too narrowly.  Nine persons indicted for participating 
in this traffic are now in gaol in New York awaiting their trial.</p>
<p>Lady Franklin and niece have visited Nevada Territory, where they were 
received with honour by the Legislature then in session there.</p>

<p>Mexico now has full notice of what is in store for her.</p>

<p rend="center">They are coming, and they are three.</p>

<p>The terms of the convention under which England, France, and Spain intend to
 act are before the public, and nothing can be more just or fair.  The Powers 
enter upon the scene less as soldiers than as policemen.  It is specially agreed
 that no Power is to acquire any territory.  The important places are to be 
occupied, and then the Mexicans themselves will be rather stringently invited
 to set their house in order.  It has also been provided, in order that the 
"United" States may have no pretext for complaint, that President Lincoln may 
send in aid of the expedition any number of ships which he can spare from his 
operations against the South.  It is to be hoped that the ruffians who, under 
the priests, at present exercise unrestrained sway in the unfortunate country 
in question will not avail themselves of the interval between the announcement
 and the arrival of the expedition to commit new atrocities.  If they should do
 so, the duties of the policeman will have to be temporarily exchanged for 
those of the Provost Marshal and it is possible that the Mexican brigands may 
have a distinct idea that such will be the case.  Lieutenant-Colonel Lowder 
commands our force, and the officers have received orders to proceed to Plymouth
 for embarkation.</p>
<p>The American question is treated elsewhere.  Here it may be sufficient to 
note, as part of the record of the war, that the Federals have suffered another 
and a severe repulse on the Potomac, losing a General and 600 men.  Smaller
 affairs are reported, in which the Federals state themselves to have had the
 advantage, but the Southern journals deny this.  But a grand naval blow is now 
to be struck; and at the last mails a fleet of eighty vessels, with from 30,000
 to 40,000 men on board, was to sail the next day, probably to attack New 
Orleans.  We have no information that justifies our believing that the South
 has adequate means of resisting such an onslaught; but the Confederates speak
 undauntedly, and declare that, be the victory as complete as it may, it shall 
be a barren one.  The army, under General M'Lellan, was daily expected to 
advance upon the enemy.</p>

<p rend="center">GUARD TENT: PUNISHMENT DRILL IN THE FEDERAL CAMP.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> modes of punishment adopted in the Federal 
army may be thought, perhaps, to smack of undue barbarity, although the 
Americans have been prone to taunt the English and other European Powers with 
the brutalities practised on their soldiers.  Judging by what has been said and
 written on this subject by Americans, it would seem that a free and enlightened
 people like our Transatlantic cousins, even when serving in the ranks, could 
not be treated as the hirelings of a despotic Government.  Yet, glancing at the
 Illustration on page 467 (from a Sketch by our Special Artist), it would 
require some hardihood to affirm that the English soldier is treated with 
greater indignity or cruelty than the American citizen.  On the left is an 
unfortunate Unionist with a cannon-ball chained to his ankle, and carrying on 
his shoulder a heavy log of wood.  Another delinquent is made to stand erect
 on a small barrel for hours together; while below him is a wretched wight
 trussed like a fowl for the spit.  In the background a poor fellow is corded, 
with his hands high above his head, to a tree—the rope which supports him eating
 into his wrists and stopping the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p rend="center">CUTTING OFF A CONFEDERATE DESPATCH-GALLEY ON THE POTOMAC.</p>

<p>The Confederates of Maryland keep up a constant communication with the
 Secession forces on the Virginian shore of the Potomac, and most hazardous are
 the means frequently employed to convey information of the Federal movements 
to the enemy. At times a swift-going galley, manned by four oarsmen and a coxswain, will 
suddenly dash out from a creek at night and make rapidly for the Virginian side,
 trusting to escape the notice of the blockading flotilla in the confusion if 
speaking the numerous supply-boats carrying stores to Washington from 
Chesapeake Bay.  Sometimes these boats, it is likely enough, are successful 
in their attempts; but they are frequently detected, as in the instance 
illustrated by our Special Artist on page 470, and then ensues an exciting 
chase.  The gun-boat has lowered one of her gigs to go in pursuit, while she 
fires a shot from her bow-gun at the traitor galley.  There is full another 
mile to row to the shore, the man-of-war gig is coming up fast, and one more
 shot will shiver the "Secesh" to atoms.  So the crew give in, and the papers
 destined for Davis or Beauregard are sent up the next day to the State 
department at Washington, while the blockade-breakers are provided with 
quarters in Fortress Monroe.</p>
<p>Since receiving this Illustration from our Special Artist the
command of the Potomac by the Federal forces has been somewhat
checked.  Thus we read that on the 19th ult., as the Federal tug-boat
the Resolute was towing up the Potomac a supply-vessel, the
Confederate batteries opened upon them, and the latter, having got
adrift, was boarded.  On the same day the flag ship Union went down
the river from Washington, destined for Fortress Monroe.  To the
mortification of the National authorities, she was compelled to
return, having found it impossible to get past the formidable
batteries which the Confederates had opened.  The officers of these
vessels, moreover, announce that the guns were splendidly aimed, and
that the Confederates are able, at the various points they command, to
throw large-sized rifle shell clean over into the Maryland side.  On
the 22nd Commander Craven, of the Potomac squadron, informed the Navy
Department that the Confederate batteries were impassable, a
formidable battery at Matthias Point having been unmasked. </p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The American National Hymn</hi>.—It will be remembered, perhaps, that some Americans, sick of "Yankee Doodle," 
"Hail, Columbia!" and "The Star-spangled Banner," offered a prize of 500 
dollars for a new national hymn.  Twelve hundred "copies of verses" were 
forwarded to the committee appointed for selection and judgment, who, being
 men of some sense and taste, came to the decision—which might have been 
anticipated—that not one out of the twelve hundred was worthy the prize of
 £100.  The labour of the committee, however, did not end here.  They 
resolved to make a dollar volume out of the rejected hymns, and committed 
its arrangement to Mr. Richard Grant White, whose name is known on this side 
of the Atlantic as a painstaking editor and commentator on Shakspeare.  
This book of hymns has just been published in New York, printed on tinted 
paper, with an essay by Mr. White on "National Hymns; how they are written, 
and how they are not written," illustrated by the words and music of the most 
popular patriotic European hymns.  Then follows a selection of the best and 
the worst of the rejected twelve hundred.  The worst, of course, are expected 
to be the most entertaining, as Mr. White prints them 
<hi rend="italic">verbatim et literatim</hi>, in all their grammatical and 
rhetorical effulgency.—<hi rend="italic">Critic</hi>.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the Cunard steamer Arabia we have Boston 
journals to the 30th ult. and a telegram viâ Halifax to the 31st.  
Owing to the stormy weather on the Atlantic, the weekly steamer of the 
Canadian line has not yet arrived.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The great naval expedition sailed from Hampton Roads on the 29th ult.  
The naval armament is under the command of Captain Dupont, and the troops 
under that of Brigadier-General Sherman, an old and experienced officer.  
The troops number about 20,000 men, mostly from New England and New York.  
All the matérial of the expedition is of corresponding magnitude.  
There are boats enough to land a division at a time.  There are army-<choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> and horses in abundance.  Carpenters, 
masons, and labourers, with stone and other building materials, accompany 
the troops.  It is the largest and best appointed naval force which ever 
left a United States' port.  Secretary Cameron instructs the commanders to
 hold strictly to the Conservative course hitherto pursued by the Federal 
Government towards the slaves in the vicinage of the place where the expedition
 will land.</p>
<p>With reference to the Federal defeat near Leesburg, now definitively called
 the battle of Ball's Bluff, we learnt nothing by the telegraph, as the 
Federal commanders showed no desire to publish their disasters to the world.  
Private letters to the newspapers revealed the truth.  In one regiment there 
were only two swords and no firelocks left; all the others were lost, captured, 
or thrown away.  The scramble to the river is described as frightful—another 
Beresina—masses of drowning men.  If the Confederates had been provided with 
artillery there would have been a pitiable massacre.  The report of Colonel 
Hinks, of the Massachusetts 19th Regiment, sets down the loss at 900 out of 
2100 engaged.  Of these 500 are reckoned as prisoners.  He also reports that 
a New York City regiment (the "Tammany") deserted its post in the intrenchments
 on an island in the Potomac and crossed over to the Maryland shore in 
disobedience of orders.  He says the means of transportation were "criminally 
deficient" and the landing-place most unfortunately selected, while within 
half a mile on either side there were convenient spots for the purpose.</p>
<p>The grand army of the Potomac is doing nothing more heroic than devastating
 the small portion of the Valley of Virginia which they hold.  In Western 
Virginia the Confederates have been surprised in and dislodged from Romney. 
 In Kentucky the skirmishes have resulted in favour of the Federalists, who 
hold two-thirds of the State.</p>
<p>In Missouri General Fremont has been at length superseded by the President.
  General Hunter succeeds him in the command of the army of the West.  General
 Henderson has capitulated with 400 Confederates.  Many persons think that the 
removal of Fremont will have an injurious effect on recruiting in the Western
 States.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Judge Merrick has been put under arrest for issuing writs of habeas corpus 
in behalf of minors who have enlisted without their parents' consent, and for 
issuing warrants against the military authorities who disobeyed the writ.  The 
President subsequently intimated to the court that he had suspended the 
privilege of the writ in regard to the army, and the dispute ends with the 
victory of the military over the civil authorities.</p>
<p>General Baker's remains were honoured with public obsequies, which, however,
 spectators assert, were very negligently conducted.  The President was much 
affected by the event.  He paced up and down his room all night.  Mrs. Lincoln
 received no visitors.  Lord Lyons would have attended the funeral, but the 
invitation did not reach him in time.</p>

<p rend="center">WESTERN VIRGINIA.</p>

<p>The people of this region have ratified the action of their Legislature, 
and voted in favour of separation from the rest of the State by large m
ajorities in both city and country.  A convention is to assemble on the 26th
 inst., to frame a Constitution for the new State, named Kanawha, from the 
river of that name which traverses it.  Thirty-nine counties participated in 
this vote.</p>

<p rend="center">GARIBALDI'S SYMPATHIES.</p>

<p>The following, addressed to the United States' Consul at Antwerp, has been
 published as genuine:— </p>

<p rend="right">Caprera, Sept. 10, 1861.</p>
<q>My dear Sir,—I saw Mr. Sandford, and regret to be 
obliged to announce to you that I shall not be able to go to the United States
 at present.  I do not doubt of the triumph of the Union, and that shortly.  But
 if the war should unfortunately continue in your beautiful country, I shall 
overcome all obstacles which detain me and hasten to the defence of a people
 who are dear to me.              <hi rend="right">G. GARIBALDI</hi></q>
<p>To Mr. Quiggle, United States' Consul at Antwerp.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Memminger, the Secretary of the Treasury, has issued a circular, dated 
Richmond, Oct. 17, relative to the produce loan and the application of the 
cotton-planters for relief.  Mr. Memminger, in the name of the Cabinet, 
declines to grant any relief, either by the purchase of the cotton crop or an 
advance upon its hypothecated value.  He advises the planters to apply to the 
bankers for relief, and to "take measures for winter crops to relieve the 
demand for grain and provisions.  Let them proceed to divert part of their 
labour from cotton, and make their own clothing and supplies."</p>
<p>At the commercial convention held in Macon, Georgia, some resolutions 
conceived in a spirit hostile to the future resumption of commercial relations
 with the North were voted down on the motion of General Duff Green, who 
declared that the adoption of these resolutions would make any adjustment with
 the North impossible, and prevent any reconstruction of the commercial and 
financial relations between the North and the South.  This is interpreted at
 the North as a sign that the Southerners are not bent on resisting to the 
extremity.</p>
<p>Some citizens of Hyde County, North Carolina—a county in which Hatteras
 Inlet is included—have met together, under the protection of the Federal 
forces, and affirmed their unshaken loyalty to the Union and their 
non-allegiance to the Confederate Government.</p>
<p>M. Antonio Costa, of New Orleans, has reopened connection by mail between
 the Southern States and Europe, which has been closed since August.  The mail
 is a monthly one, and goes by way of Mexico and the English steamers to the
 West Indies.  The first post contained 1233 letters.  The tariff of charges
 is—to Mexico, 50 cents; to Cuba, 75 cents; to Europe, 1 dollar.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The vote at the late State election for the two "war" candidates for 
Governor was 86,300; for the peace candidate less than 33,000.</p>
<p>The first telegram sent from the Pacific to the Atlantic was sent by 
Chief Justice Field, of California, to the President.  It was as follows:—</p>

<p rend="right">Sacramento, Oct. 24. </p>
<q>In the tempoaray absence of the Governor of the State,
 I am requested to send you the first message which will be transmitted over
 the wires of the telegraph line which connect the Pacific with the Atlantic 
States.  The people of California desire to congratulate you upon the 
completion of the great work.  They believe that it will be the means of 
strengthening the attachment which binds both the East and the West to the
 Union; and they desire in this the first message across the Continent to 
express their loyalty to that Union and their determination to stand by the
 Government in this its day of trial.  They regard that Government with 
affection, and will adhere to it under all fortunes.</q>

<p>The European news which starts from Newfoundland at, say,4 p.m. would reach
 San Francisco at 11.30 a.m., or four hours and a half ahead of time.</p>

<p rend="center">THE PRIVATEERSMEN ON TRIAL.</p>

<p>The case of the captain of the privateer Savannah at New York, after a 
trial of three days' duration, ended in the discharge of the jury, they being 
unable to agree on a verdict.  In Philadelphia a jury have found a 
privateersman "Guilty."  The Judge has not yet pronounced sentence.</p>

<p>In the State of Kentucky at the present time it is estimated there are 
nearly 2,700,090 hogs and in Missouri nearly 2,000,000.  In the whole of the
 United States about 30,000,000 hogs are raised annually, of which more than 
one-half are raised in the Southern States.  During the week ending the 19th 
ult. 1,377,546 bushels of grain and 83,524 barrels of flour were exported 
from New York to Europe.  The value of these exports was about 455,000.

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> a recent Number we gave an Illustration and some
 account of the American Pony Express, the means by which rapid communication 
is maintained between the far-divided territories of the United States situated
 on each side of the Rocky Mountains.  We this week give a View of the town of 
St. Joseph, the eastern terminus of the various overland expresses, and one of 
the principal points of arrival and departure of the great overland traffic to 
and from the eastern and western territories.</p>
<p>The Sketch from which our Illustration is engraved is taken from the 
landing-place on the Kansas shore, near the town of Pembroke, where a 
steam-ferry exists, by which means the coaches, <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>, &amp;c., are carried across the turbid waters of the Missouri.</p>
<p>St. Joseph, always irreverently called St. Joe in the States, is a quaint 
and curious town, though so new, yet full of interest; like all newly-born 
American cities, it has commenced its growth in a number of different places
 at the same time.  The land, being laid out in square blocks and lots, is
 purchased sometimes 
by people who speculate in a rise in the price and do not intend to build; 
consequently those who do often find themselves without neighbours for some 
years after they have erected their houses, and a great street that is to be,
 may for some time have only one house in it.  "Town lots" are
 "<choice><reg>favorite</reg><orig>favourite</orig></choice> items" with the speculators, and no 
end of money has been made by the judicious and farseeing, and large sums 
have been as frequently lost by the over-sanguine and incautious.</p>
<p>St. Joe can boast of some good shops round about the market-place, and the
 houses in that locality lie pretty thick.  The principal buildings are, as 
usual in American towns, the hotels, and although St. Joe is a far-off,
 outlying place, with many a long stretch of prairie between it and the
 populous cities of the Union, yet the "Patee House" affords as comfortable
 accommodation and entertainment as many of the great hotels in the large 
cities.</p>
<p>St. Joe has of late been brought much before the public in England in the 
constantly-arriving reports from America; it is now threatened by the 
Confederate forces, and we may hear any day of the place being taken by a
 <hi rend="italic">coup de main</hi>.  It was in the immediate neighbourhood 
of this city that the great wooden bridge was partly destroyed by the enemy, 
so that on the arrival of the train the whole was precipitated into a deep 
ravine, and a number of persons killed and wounded.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature about St. Joe arises from the fact of its 
being the principal point of departure and arrival for the trains of
 <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> going or returning from the overland
 passage to California or Oregon.  In our account of the pony express we
 mentioned the firm of Russell, Major, and Co., as being the proprietors 
of it; that is, however, but a small part of their business, for they are 
the most extensive carriers of goods and passengers in the Union, excepting, 
of course, the railway companies.  They started last year from St. Joe, 
Leavenworth, and Nebraska city, two hundred and eighteen trains<pb n="492"/> 
 of <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>, each train consisting of twenty-six 
 <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>, making in all five thousand six hundred 
 and sixty-eight <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>, each drawn by twelve 
bullocks, consequently requiring in all between sixty and seventy thousand
 bullocks, besides relays and substitutes for those which break down.  This 
firm execute large transportation contracts for the United States' Government;
 their business with them in 1858 amounted to five million dollars.  They
 employ in all about five thousand men.</p>
<p>Near the foot of the Rocky Mountains is a place called Denver City.  
Large deposits of gold and silver exist in its neighbourhood, and, as several 
thousand persons live there who produce nothing but the precious metals, the 
whole of the supplies have to be carried in these <choice><reg>wagon</reg><orig>waggon</orig></choice>-trains.  This is a large portion of the business during the summer,
 as they are entirely shut off from all supplies during the winter.  The 
United States' mail is carried twice a month from St. Joe to Salt Lake City, 
the abode of the Mormons, and on to Placerville, California.</p>
 <p>For mutual protection the <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> travel in 
trains across the plains, from sixteen to twenty-six making up a train.  
Each large <choice><reg>wagon</reg><orig>waggon</orig></choice> carries about 6000lb.: they are 
drawn by oxen or horses; they start early in the morning, and travel until 
midday; the cattle then graze on the plains in charge of a herdsman, while 
the voyageurs hunt and shoot, plenty of game being found on the prairies, 
as well as buffaloes, deer, elks, and antelopes.  At night the 
  <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice> are placed together so as to form a 
square or a triangle, the cattle being placed within the inclosure, the camp 
fires are lighted, and the men sleep on the ground wrapped in their blankets.
  Great caution is necessary when travelling on the plains, as tribes of wild
 Indians traverse them, who steal and kill when they dare; they are, however, 
afraid of white men and the terrible weapons they carry, and will only attack 
when immeasurably superior in numbers.  There are Comanchees, Pawnees, Crows, 
Blackfeet, Assinitoines, Sioux, and others; occasionally they fight great 
battles with each other.  At one place on the route of the trains is a spot 
called the Battle Ground: it consists of about six acres of land, filled with
 holes about 2ft. square and 4ft. deep.  In these holes a whole tribe of 
Indians hid themselves so that, when their opponents camped in the 
neighbourhood, they were unobserved, and, choosing a fitting time, they rushed
 down upon the unsuspecting enemy, and slaughtered and scalped the greater 
part of them.</p>

<p>At length the Southern States have sent us two gentlemen authorised to state
 to England the position and resolution of the Confederates.  The Hon. Messrs.
 Mann and Yancey were entertained by the Fishmongers on the night of the Lord 
Mayor's banquet, at which latter Mr. Adams, the American Minister, made a 
highly-complimentary speech, claiming for the North the same ancestry, 
traditions, and laws as those of England, but never alluding to the fact
 that ten millions of his countrymen were in arms against the North.  Mr. 
Adams was delivering himself thus at one end of a street at the other end
 of which Mr. Yancey was thanking us for having recognised the South as 
"belligerents," and was declaring that there could be no peace until they 
ceased to be treated as rebels.  He spoke out boldly, asserted the certainty 
of Southern independence, but added that there were few sacrifices it would
 not make consistently with the claims of liberty and honour.  Perhaps the 
impression is deepening that as soon as the North shall have gained some 
brilliant military or naval victory, and thus atoned for the long series of
 disasters which have marked its campaigns, both parties will not be 
disinclined to listen to the mediating voices of France and England.  If 
this should not be the case, and the ruin and wretchedness of millions in 
the Old World should appear the inevitable consequence of a continuance of 
the blockade, it is not impossible that the statesmen of both these countries
 may have to consider how far the rule <hi rend="italic">salus populi suprema 
lex</hi> can be harmonised with a too rigid interpretation of the law of 
nations.  But we trust they may be spared any such necessity.  We now await
 with interest the news from the great fleet which the North has sent forth.</p>

<p>The annual ceremony of the Lord Mayor's Day was attended on Saturday with
 all the paraphernalia that have come through time-hallowed customs to be 
associated with that event.  . . .</p>
<p>In the evening a more than usually influential company assembled to dine 
at the Guildhall.  Among the speakers after dinner were the Duke of Cambridge,
 Lord Palmerston, and Mr. Adams, the United States' Minister. . . . Lord 
Palmerston congratulated the country on the satisfactory state of the revenue, 
and spoke of the present dearth of cotton as a temporary evil which would, 
no doubt, be productive of  permanent good.  "We shall find," he said, "in
 various quarters of the globe a sure, a certain, and an ample supply, which
 will prevent us being dependent on one source of production." . . . His
 Lordship touched but slightly on the American war.  He "viewed the conflict
 with an affliction which no words could express; but it was not for us to 
pass judgment upon the dispute."  The Lord Mayor offered to Mr. Adams "the 
entire sympathy of the whole British people."  His Excellency, in returning 
thanks, said he was there to perpetuate the friendly relations between England
 and the United States.  He dwelt chiefly on the honour which is paid in 
America to those who have distinguished themselves in the mother country, 
and made the troubles which distract his country conspicuous by the absence
 of any reference thereto in his address. . . .</p>

<p>Whilst Mr. Adams was being fêted at the Mansion House, Mr. Dudley 
Mann and Mr. Yancey, the Plenipotentiaries of the Confederate States, were
 dining and making speeches at the hall of the Fishmongers' Company.  The Prime
 Warden expressed an earnest hope that the strife which is now raging in North 
America might speedily give way to peace.  Mr. Yancey echoed this sentiment, 
but said there was no prospect of such a result so long as the Federal 
Government treated the people of the South as rebels.  If the North would 
recognise them as belligerents, then the Confederate Government would be 
"inflexible on one point only—its honour and independence.  For the great 
interests of peace and humanity it would yield much that is merely material
 or of secondary importance.  The Southerners," he continued, "are fighting 
for the right to govern themselves, and for the purpose of resisting 
subjugation; and, though they are cut off from foreign trade, they are still
 in a position to equip and maintain in the field an army of 250,000 men.  
They have not sought, and they do not desire, foreign intervention; for they
 are united, and can fight their own battles.  They are anxious to be 
recognised by the various Powers, but they have no reason to complain, nor 
do they feel aggrieved, because these great Powers see fit for a season to 
defer their formal recognition and reception into the family of nations."  
The report states that Mr. Yancey resumed his seat amid loud and continued 
cheering.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brigham Young</hi>, the
 President and Chief Prophet of the Church of the Latter Day Saints, or 
Mormons, was born about the year 1800.  Very little is known of his early 
life.  It is generally supposed that he is a native of the State of Ohio;
 and it is said that he has brothers engaged in the ministry in the Methodist 
Church.  In connection with the Mormons he first appeared in a prominent 
position in August, 1844, soon after the murder of Joseph Smith, the founder
 of the sect.  Young was then President of the Twelve Apostles, and in that
 capacity signed a letter addressed "To the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter
 Day Saints in Nauvoo (Illinois) and all the World."  One of the principal
 men in the community, Sydney Rigdon, sought to succeed Smith; but charges 
of heresy and improper conduct were urged against him by Young and others; 
he was excommunicated, and Young was appointed the successor of Smith.  By 
his shrewdness and great natural ability he has shown the wisdom of the choice.
  Perceiving that the Illinoisians were hostile to his people, he planned and 
carried out an exodus unparalleled in history for the sufferings of the people
 who accomplished it.  They resolved to place the Rocky Mountains between 
them and persecuting Christendom.  Cold and hunger killed many on the road;
 but, after a year and a half of inconceivable hardships, the pioneers reached
 the Valley of the Great Salt Lake, in July, 1847, and founded a settlement.  
The mass of the people followed in the next year, and in the thirteen years 
which have succeeded, under the guidance and government of Brigham Young, they
 have converted a bare valley into a lovely region of cultivated fields, rich 
orchards, flower-filled gardens, and pleasant residences.  They have brought the
 water from the hills in sparkling rivulets through every street.  They have
 erected mills for grinding the grain of their own growth, and sawing the wood 
that their own sturdy arms have felled.  They manufacture their own paper, and 
spin and weave their own fabrics; and when articles are wanted from the outer 
world they are carried across the great desert in <choice><reg>wagons</reg><orig>waggons</orig></choice>, sometimes numbering over fifty in a single train.  In all these works 
"the President," as the people call him, or "Brother Brigham," as he styles
 himself, has been the directing and influencing power.  He has forbidden the
 establishment of beershops, and there is only one place in Salt Lake City 
where liquor in quantities can be obtained.  Soon after sunset the streets are
 as quiet as Goldsmith's Deserted Village, for the citizens remain in their
 homes, except when in the winter they attend the balls or theatrical
 entertainments, which are frequent, or exercise their voices in their musical 
parties.  A traveller ignorant of their practice of polygamy would say from the
 appearance of things that a more industrious and better-conducted community is 
not to be found.  They consider polygamy, to the extent of having five wives at 
least, an essential of respectability; but the practice is by no means
 universal.  Young is President by semi-annual election, or rather by a 
unanimous vivâ voce confirmation by the people assembled in the Bowery. 
 He rules, as head of the Church and <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> Governor
 of the territory of Utah, over a region containing more than 180,000 square
 miles prior to the formation by the last Congress of the new territories, 
which have slightly infringed upon his domain.  This is an extent of country
 exceeding the size of Great Britain and Ireland by over 70,000 square miles. 
 Young is a portly man of middle height, now in his sixty-second year, and 
apparently so healthy that he may live for some years yet to direct the 
destinies of the 70,000 who are said to reside in Utah.</p>

<p rend="center">BRIGHAM YOUNG'S RESIDENCE.</p>

<p>The residence of Brigham Young is on the northern side of Salt Lake City, 
on a declivity above which the foothills of the Wahsatch Mountains rise. In 
the View his house is nearly in the centre, and is surmounted by a small square
 tower with a golden beehive on the top, the emblem of the city.  In this
 building, which is of timber, his first wife and family reside.  The low 
building on the left contains the offices of the church.  Next on the left, 
the principal object in the picture, is the Zion House, where the remainder 
of his wives reside.  Some say there are twenty of these spiritual wives, 
others say sixty-one, one for each year of his life.  A smaller (round) tower 
to the left of the turret on the house surmounts the schoolhouse, a neat 
edifice, in which the children only of Brigham Young and Heber Kimball only 
are educated.  The white house on the right of Brigham's was the first 
erected for him in Salt Lake City, and is now the home of his eldest son 
and designated successor, Joseph Young.  The buildings on the extreme left 
in the View are garden houses, offices, and residences of some of the wives.
  A wall of earth and stones incloses a large piece of ground, and surrounds 
Young's and Kimball's premises and gardens.  In the lower corner of the
 Engraving, on the right, is a portion of the residence of Bishop Wells.</p>
<p>The View and the Portrait are from photographs taken recently by C. R. 
Savage, late of Southampton, and were brought from Salt Lake City by a
 gentleman who spent several days there early in September.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">BY</hi> the arrival of the Cunard steamer Africa we 
have news from New York to the 6th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The expeditionary fleet had weathered the fierce gale which beset it, only
 one tug-boat, one ferry-boat, one gun-boat, and a steam-transport laden with 
horses and stores, having put back disabled.  On Saturday night, the 2nd inst.,
 the fleet was seen, in fine order, within thirty miles of Bull's Bay, on the 
coast of South Carolina.  Bull's Bay is twenty-five miles north of Charleston.  
It is generally supposed that Captain Dupont will effect a landing at this spot.
  His instructions, it is said, are very general, and leave him at liberty to 
land at such and so many points of the Southern coast as he may see fit.</p>
<p>The blockading squadrons continue to report the capture of English vessels
 trying to run into the forbidden ports.</p>
<p>The Potomac is still commanded by Confederate batteries, and the "grand
 army" in the neighbourhood of Washington still maintains its inactive attitude.
</p>
<p>In Western Virginia General Floyd had attacked General Rosencranz (Federal)
 at Gauley Bridge without success.  Two brigades were sent to cut off the
 retreat of Floyd, whose forces numbered about 7000, and hopes were 
entertained at Washington that the movement would be successful.</p>
<p>In Kentucky a Federal General captured Prestonsburg, in the extreme
 western part of the State.  The Confederate General retreated six miles, 
where he was expected to make a stand.</p>
<p>In Missouri the Confederate Generals Price and M'Culloch had united their
 forces, numbering 30,000 men, at Neosho, in the south-western angle of the
 State.  General Fremont's head-quarters were at Springfield when the order 
arrived relieving him of his command.  The intelligence created great 
indignation through the camp; many officers signified their intention to resign,
 whole companies laid down their arms.  General Fremont expostulated with both 
officers and men, and besought them not to abandon their posts.  He issued a 
farewell address to the "Mississippi army," exhorting them to continue to his 
successor the same cordial and enthusiastic support which had been accorded to
 him, and expressing his deep regret that he should not have the honour to lead 
them to the victory they were just about to win.  The body guard and Staff and 
one Brigadier-General (Asboth) remain firm to their personal allegiance, and 
return with Fremont to St. Louis.  Fremont's successor is General Hunter, his
 former second in command—a name which was metamorphosed by the telegraph into
 "Hanks."</p>

<p rend="center">THE ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S REPORT.</p>

<p>In order to satisfy public opinion that the action of the Administration was
 justifiable in reference to Fremont, the Cabinet has given to the public the 
report of the Adjutant-General on which they acted.  It is a tissue of invective
 against the deposed General, in which General Hunter and the Quartermaster and
 Paymaster-General figure as prominent accusers.  The following sentence will
 give the reader a fair idea of the general tone and style of this remarkable
 document:—</p>

<p>The opinion entertained by gentlemen of position and intelligence who have
 approached and observed him (Fremont) is that he is more fond of the pomp than
 of the stern realities of war; that his mind is incapable of fixed attention 
or strong concentration; that by his mismanagement of affairs since his arrival
 in Missouri the State has almost been lost; and that if he is continued in 
command the worst results may be anticipated.</p>

<p rend="center">THE RETIREMENT OF GENERAL SCOTT.</p>

<p>On the 31st ult., General Winfield Scott withdrew from active service on 
the ground of his increasing physical infirmities.  "For more than three
 years," he says, "I have been unable to mount a horse or to walk more than a 
few paces at a time, and that with much pain.  Other and new infirmities—dropsy
 and vertigo—admonish me that repose of mind and body are necessary to add a 
little more to a life already protracted much beyond the usual span of man." 
 The resignation was regretfully accepted, but his full pay and allowances are
 continued; and a special visit of the Cabinet was made to General Scott's 
residence to bid him farewell.  An affecting scene took place, in which 
General Scott shed tears, made a speech, and shook hands with every member 
of the Cabinet in turn.  General Scott was born in Eastern Virginia on the 
13th of June, 1786, and is consequently now in his seventy-sixth year.  He 
entered the army in 1808.  He was taken prisoner by the British at the battle
 of Queenstown, and was severely wounded at Lundy's Lane.  His services in the
 Mexican War are better known.  In 1852 he was the Whig candidate for the 
Presidency, but was defeated by General Pierce, who was the standard-bearer 
of by far the stronger party.  Since the revolution commenced it is 
superfluous to say that he has repudiated all notion of allegiance to his native State,
 and devoted himself with all his energies to the cause of the Union.  
General Scott, accompanied by several members of his family, is now on his 
way to Europe.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NEW COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan received the post vacated by the veteran Scott.  He was
 born in the city of Philadelphia on the 26th of December, 1826, and is 
therefore not yet thirty-five years of age.  In the general order to the army
 announcing his promotion he says hesitation and self-distrust may well
 accompany the assumption of so vast a responsibility; but, confiding in 
the excellent qualities of his troops and the favour of Providence to the just
 cause, he cannot doubt of success.  The municipal authorities of his native
 city having presented him with a sword, he replied very modestly:—</p>

<p>Nothing that I have yet accomplished  would warrant this high compliment. 
 It is for the future to determine whether I shall realise the  expectations
 and hopes that have been centred in me.  I trust and feel that the day is not
 far distant when I shall return to the place dearest of all others to me, 
there to spend the balance of my life among the people from whom I have received
 this beautiful gift.  The war cannot be long.  It may be desperate.  I ask in
 the future forbearance, patience, and confidence.  With these we can
 recomplish all.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The Southern journals continue to urge on the planters the necessity of
 abandoning the cultivation of cotton and tobacco, and the dedication of the
 land to the production of cereals and meat.  The New Orleans 
<hi rend="italic">Delta</hi> remarks that prices of breadstuffs had advanced
 to most exorbitant prices.</p>

<p rend="center">JEWISH DISABILITIES.</p>

<p>A cavalry regiment having been raised in New York city, of which the
 majority were of the Jewish faith, a Rabbi had applied for the chaplaincy. 
 The Secretary for War replied that the Act of Congress only allowed the
 appointment of chaplains who belonged to "some Christian denomination."  The
 restriction is generally condemned, and public opinion demands that at the
 ensuing Session of Congress the Act be modified in a liberal sense.</p>
<pb n="513"/>
<p rend="center">PERSONAL.</p>

<p>General Wool, commanding at Fortress Monroe, has resigned.</p>
<p>General Havelock, of the British Army, and brother of the hero of Lucknow,
 had arrived in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwin James, late M.P. and Q.C., had declared his intention to become
 an American citizen, and applied for admission to the New York bar.</p>
<p>The many European friends of Mr. Paul Morphy (whose home is in New Orleans
) will be glad to learn that he had recently paid a visit to Richmond, and was 
then in perfect health.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Judge Grier, of Philadelphia, while presiding at the trial of a
 privateersman, said it was a farce to try this class of prisoners while the 
war endured. "The dictates of humanity would counsel the Government to treat
 captives on the sea the same as those taken on land, and he could not 
understand the policy of hanging the first and holding the latter as prisoners 
or releasing them. Let the rebellion be crushed and then men might be tried 
for treason or piracy, and he would assist." No sentence has yet been passed 
on the prisoners already brought in guilty of the crime of piracy.</p>
<p>The elections in the States of Massachusetts and New York had resulted in 
the defeat of the Democratic party and the over whelming triumph of the united
 Republican and Union party, pledged to support President Lincoln in his war 
policy.</p>
<p>The exodus of free coloured emigrants from Canada and the Northern States to
 Hayti, by way of Boston and New York, continues.</p>
<p>The ship Maritana, of Providence, bound from Liverpool to Boston, struck on
 Egg Rocks, near Boston Light, and went to pieces. The captain, mate, and
 twenty-five of the passengers were drowned.</p>

<p rend="center">COMMERCIAL.</p>

<p>The imports at the port of New York show a decrease of almost one half
 compared with those of 1859, while the exports of domestic produce and general
 merchandise are almost double the exports of the same period in 1859.</p>
<p>The annual yield of the newly-opened silver-mines of California is 
estimated at the value of £1,200,000.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Previous</hi> Numbers of this Journal have contained 
some particulars of the unsuccessful attempt of Stone's and Bank's columns to
 effect a landing on the 21st ult, on the Virginian Shore of the Upper Potomac,
 near Leesburg; and we now give two Illustrations, from Sketches by our Special
 Artist, in connection with this seemingly mad enterprise on the part of the 
Federal forces. The whole affair appears to have been ill-planned, and adds
 another to the grievous blunders committed by the Federal commanders. It is
 hardly credible that 1800 men should have been sent across a river in the 
face of an enemy most strongly posted, and left unsupported when 30,000 of the 
division to which they belonged were within sound of their rifles. The small
 body, however, fought gallantly throughout the day against three times their 
number. One incident of the fight—a desperate effort made by the 15th 
Massachusetts Regiment to clear the woods by a bayonet charge—is illustrated 
on our first page. This is believed to be the only instance in which a bayonet
 charge has been attempted by a regiment in the Federal army. The 15th 
Massachusetts fought most gallantly throughout the whole affair, although they
 knew the odds to be greatly against them; and the example set by their 
officers, mostly students from Harvard College, Cambridge, was most 
praiseworthy. Their efforts, however, were not crowned with success, as the 
deadly fire of the Mississippi riflemen drove them back each time; and, as 
evening drew on, seeing the utter uselessness of contending against their 
powerful enemy, the few surviving combatants slowly fell back to the river-side
 with but two line officers remaining. In the endeavour to recross to the 
island, midway between the Maryland and Virginian shores, from which they 
had started, the general organisation of the force was quite abandoned, each
 company acting separately. The officers and men who could swim started, half
 naked, over the river, and the boats were kept awhile for the wounded. This,
 however, lasted but a little time. All order was quickly lost. A large flat 
boat was sunk by overcrowding, and scores of men perished, some by drowning 
and some by the fire of the Confederates, who now crowded the high bank and 
poured an incessant fire upon the scattering fugitives. The river channel was 
thickly strewed with the dead and dying, but the bearing of the survivors is 
reported to have been strangely quiet—the immobility, perhaps of desperate 
hopelessness. Hundreds, probably, were here sacrificed. This much is certain, 
that out of the 1800 who landed scarcely 600 returned. The retreat of the 
Federalists forms the subject of the accompanying Engraving.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> fearful storms which have raged on the 
eastern coast of North America have acquired a strange and almost ghastly 
interest for the North and South. The magnificently-described Armada that 
had sailed to deal the accumulated vengeance of the Federalists upon the 
Confederates had, it was thought, steered into the very heart of the tempest.
 The most opposite passions were aroused, and while the Northerners were 
praying that the armament to which the honour of the Union had been so 
solemnly confided might escape the fury of the elements the fiercer prayers 
of the South went up for its destruction- a result which the terrible 
character of the storms made painfully probable. We are told that it is 
almost certain that the fleet has been preserved; and we may hear at once 
that it has not only been saved, but has delivered its blow at Charleston or
 elsewhere. Meantime affairs on land have assumed a perplexing, not to say 
menacing, character. It was finally decided to remove General Fremont from
 his command, and the order came suddenly down to his camp, together with 
the journals which made the fact public. A mutiny of the gravest kind instantly
 showed itself. We say of the gravest kind, because the principal actors were
 not from the rank and file, but were officers, whose first duty was 
subordination, and who set the fatal example of declaring that they would not
 serve except under the General whose somewhat melodramatic faults seem to have
 endeared him to the forces lately under his command. General Fremont himself
 had to appeal to their sense of duty to the Republic; and it would appear 
that a sullen acquiescence was obtained, and that they will condescend to fight
 under the new leader appointed by the authorities. This may all augur ill for 
operations in that quarter. An American writer who has been narrowly inspecting
 the army of the North draws so unfavourable a picture of its discipline, 
cleanliness, and soldierly bearing as makes the English reports appear almost 
complimentary. But, in the face of all, Secretary Cameron announces to the 
nation that the day of reverses is over, and that the Union is now about to
 proceed from triumph to triumph. More to the purpose, it is distinctly stated 
that not only is the abolition of Southern slavery entirety out of the plans 
of the North, but that slaves who may be used by the army of the Federalists 
shall, if they belong to loyal owners, be paid for just as if they had been 
mules or any other article required for the campaign. This may be regarded as
 a provisional olive-branch held out to smooth matters in the event of a 
Northern success making a compromise possible. The Abolition party are 
enraged beyond measure, and their demonstrations are formidable. Meantime the
 usual raving of the ribald press is launched against England; and we are 
told that ours is a "Puritan and blackleg Cabinet," that the 
<hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> is the accepted organ of the English Tories
 (which may be news to our contemporary), and that as soon as ever the war is
 over " such a train of disasters" shall be inflicted upon England as shall
 make her rue the day when she dared to say that ten millions of Americans
 were belligerents instead of rebels. It is impossible to believe that such
 rabid rant and utter nonsense can have weight with educated Americans; but
 why is it tolerated by authorities that have and use power to suppress a 
journal for only expressing a wish for peace?...</p>
<p>The Americans, who profess themselves so enchanted at the sympathies of
 the Czar, and who half menace us and France with a Russo-American crusade,
 will have some few sacrifices to make in the matter of civilisation when 
the proposed coalition takes place. They open private letters, imprison
 suspected persons, put down journals, and clamour for hanging spies, but 
they have not attained the point of tying up women and flogging them for 
Southern proclivities, though, if it be true, as stated, that "the ladies
 of the North are all for the Southrons," there is no saying what the New 
York press may not recommend as "vigour of action."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">New Adelphi</hi>.—The 
long-announced production or "The Octoroon," the new sensation drama by Mr. 
Boucicault, took place on Monday before a crowded audience which filled the 
house to the ceiling. The scene is in Louisiana, where the Octoroon, or "eighth
 blood," is not allowed by law to marry with a white person; and the interest
 of the plot is based on this circumstance. Zoe, the natural daughter of Judge
 Peyton, has been reared in luxury but not fully emancipated, and on the death
 of her father is exposed to the machinations of a rascally overseer, Jacob
 M'Closkey (Mr. Emery), who, having mismanaged the estate, has an interest in
 forcing on its sale, with the slaves belonging to it, that he may purchase 
Zoe, and subdue her to his unwelcome passion. George Peyton, the nephew of 
the Judge and heir to the property (Mr. Billington), seeks naturally to avoid 
the sale, and expects daily a remittance from Liverpool sufficient to satisfy
 all demands. M'Closkey takes measures to prevent the packet from reaching his
 hands in time, in consequence of which the slaves are sold. A slave auction 
accordingly forms the grand sensation scene of the drama, which is conducted
 with all the formalities accompanying such transactions in Southern America,
 and forms a most exciting tableau. M'Closkey outbids all intending purchasers
 for the fair Octoroon, and  becomes her possessor. But, in his attempt to
 retard the delivery of the letter to Peyton, he has incurred a guilt for which
 he is destined to punishment. He has murdered a negro lad who was in charge of
 the post-bag; and a picture of the act has been accidentally taken by a 
photographic machine which was being worked in the vicinity. He falls into 
the clutches of Lyncn law, and is confined on board a steamer pending his
 execution. To effect his escape he hurls a lantern among some tar-barrels, 
and thus causes an explosion. But an avenging Indian is on his track, and 
slays him on the grave of the poor negro whom he had murdered. And all might
 now be well, but that Zoe, ignorant of these facts, has taken poison in 
despair. The drama is placed on the stage with all the accessories that can 
conduce to a great and marked success, and is illustrated with local scenery 
of great beauty. The composition itself is distinguished by a lightness and
 elegance of touch which compensates for whatever is revolting in the action. 
The whole was capitally performed. Mr. Emery was remarkably impressive in 
M'Closkey, and Mr. Boucicault as tim Yankee overseer, who afterwards turns 
photographer, was characteristically made up, and sustained his part with great 
humour. Mrs. Boucicault, as the heroine, excited so much interest that the 
audience were scarcely reconciled to her failing a victim in order to point 
more effectually the moral of the drama. We certainly recognise no aesthetic 
necessity for such a dénouement, but rather the contrary, and think that 
the author would have found his account in a happier ending. Mr. Billington, 
as the hero, was pathetic and gentlemenly; and the other parts were well 
supported, particularly that of an old negro, by Mr. George Jamison, and that 
of the Indian, by Mr. Phillips. The female parts, also, were well filled by 
Mrs. Marston and Miss Latimer. Miss Clara Denvil, as the poor murdered 
negro-lad, acted with her usual grace and spirit The success of the piece was 
decided.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">An Infernal Machine</hi>, used by the Secessionists, was recently 
described at a meeting of the Franklin Institute of Pennsylvania, and 
photographs of it were exhibited. It consisted of an iron cylinder, about six 
feet long, and two feet in diameter, and perfectly watertight. This is filled 
with 300lb. of gunpowder. It is attached by ropes six feet long to an empty 
hogshead, which supports it in the water, the side of the hogshead being 
exposed. An elastic tube is fitted watertight, and connects the interiors of 
the magazine and barrel. Through this tube the fuse runs, which is lighted
 through an aperture in the exposed side of the hogshead, and which, burning
 down till it reaches the cylinder, explodes it. The fuse would burn two hours. 
After being lighted and set loose, it was intended to float with the tide till 
it reached a vessel, and there remain, finally exploding. It was a very
 uncertain arrangement. There were two of these machines fastened by a rope
 several hundred feet long but the other was lost. These photographs were
 taken by the photographer of the Ordnance Department at the Washington 
Navy-yard.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extraordinary Capture at Sea</hi>.—The following 
strange story was telegraphed from Southampton, through Mr. Reuter's office:— 
"Southampton,Thursday.—A large paddle-steamer, the Nashville, flying the 
Confederate flag, has just arrived in our river and landed the captain and 
crew of the American ship Harvey Birch. Captain Nelson, of the Harvey Birch, 
reports having left havre on Saturday last, the 17th inst., bound for New York,
 in ballast. On the 19th inst., when in lat. 42 deg. 6 min. N., long. 9 deg. 
52 min. W., she was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander
 Peagrim, late of the United States' navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately 
boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who at once ordered the 
captain and crew on board the steamer, allowing them to take a few of their 
effects and fresh provisions. Captain Peagrim then ordered the Harvey Birch 
to be fired, and laid alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge. 
Captain Nelson is just landed with his crew and officers, twenty-nine in all,
 and has immediattely placed himself in communication with Captain Britton, 
the United States' Consul at this port. The Nashville is still lying in the 
river, flying the Southern Confederate flag. Captain Nelson says that 
Commander Peagrim states he has no commission from the Southern Government 
as a war-steamer, and yet declares he is not a privateer. No Southern 
Commissioners have arrived by the Nashville. There are, however, on board a 
Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton appears to have some commission to 
execute, as he proceeds to London immediately. The Nashville has experienced 
very bad weather since running the blockade at Charleston. Her crew consists 
of English and Irish, who, after shipment, were compelled to sign other 
articles. The whole of the crew of the Harvey Birch, with the exception of 
Captain Nelson and his two officers, were placed in irons until arriving here. 
Captain Peagrim endeavoured to make Captain Nelson and his crew take an oath
 of allegiance to the Confederate Government. Captain Peagrim has communicated
 with Mr. Yancey."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has become a question whether there is any 
design in both or either of the contending parties in the States of America 
to obtain from Great Britain, in a certain sense involuntarily, that which 
would amount to a violation of neutrality. It is well known that there has 
been, and probably there still is, an irritability among the more sensitive
 spirits of the Federal States against England on account of the decided 
principles of non-intervention in this terrible quarrel which have been laid
 down by our statesmen and universally acquiesced in by our people. What was
 expected of this country in such a juncture of American affairs as now exists
 does not very clearly appear; but of the fact that dissatisfaction with the 
conduct of England prevails to a considerable extent in the Northern States 
there is no doubt. Of the feeling towards this country in the Southern States
 we have little or no knowledge; but there have been rumours, the effect of
 which is that the Confederates believe that, in our secret hearts, our leaning
 is to

their side, and that our sympathies are, so to speak, wrapped up in cotton. So 
much of our prosperity, and of the welfare of a large part of our population, 
is supposed, not without reason, to depend on our import of an article of which 
in our markets the South has hitherto enjoyed a practical monopoly, that it has
 been whispered that the Confederate leaders had determined not to allow the 
export of any cotton to this country under any circumstances, and even apart 
from the restriction of a blockade, in the hope that England would yield to a 
commercial pressure, which might easily be converted into a social disturbance,
 and take such steps as would in effect cause her to do something more than 
lean to the party of the Secessionists. It would scarcely be denied, even in 
America itself—certainly not in the Southern States—that even a show of 
partisanship on the part of England would throw a heavy weight into the scale
 against the party which she discountenanced; and, however any such idea may 
be disavowed, it is more than probable that either section would be glad to 
test the real feeling of this country and the absolute soundness of the 
neutrality which she professes. Circumstances have just occurred which, as we
 conceive, will tend to bring about a settlement of any doubts which may exist
 in regard to this question. Far be it from us to insinuate anything which can
 be construed into even a tendency to offence to either party in this unhappy 
contest, but we may be permitted to say that it has long been the boast of the
 Americans as a people that they are essentially what they call "smart;" and, 
among other additions to the language which is common to the Old and the New 
Country which they have succeeded in making is the word "dodge"—the significancy
 of which is admitted. Of course, the word could not exist unless that which it
 signifies also existed; and that its application should creep into the conduct
 of the public affairs of the States, Federal or Confederate, at a critical 
moment, and when a great object was at stake, would not be in the least 
surprising.</p>

<p>These remarks have been elicited by the fact that armed vessels, both of the 
Federal and Confederate States, have made their appearance at one of our
 principal ports, and have demanded that aid, in the shape of opportunities and 
facilities for refitting, which, by the permission of the Sovereign, any State 
is accustomed to afford to the war-vessels of all nations. In the case of the 
Federal vessel, whatever may have been her objects or her destination, she bore
 with her no distinctive marks of those qualities which would have brought her
 within the terms of the declaration of neutrality which has been solemnly 
enuticiated to the contending parties in America by the Government of this 
country. In that declaration it is laid down that her Majesty and all her
 subjects will "hold a strict and impartial neutrality between the Government
 of the United States of America and certain States styling themselves the 
Confederate States of America." The subjects of this realm are warned against 
adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel
 belonging to either of the contending parties; and an interdict has been laid 
on the armed ships, and also the privateers of both parties, from carrying 
prizes made by them into the ports of the United Kingdom or of any of her 
Majesty's possessions. Sinning overtly against none of these provisions, the 
James Adger—Federalist—got what she required at Southampton, and in due time
 departed from that port, whither and for what immediate purposes we were
 bound by the letter of international law not too curiously to inquire. Hardly 
had the Federal flag disappeared from our waters when the Confederate colours
 floated in the same harbour, also over an armed ship, coming, avowedly, for
 the purpose of refitting. But here the parallel ceases. Without any attempt
 at disguise, but, as far as we can judge, with ostentatious frankness, it is
 made known by the commander of the Nashville that almost, if not entirely, in
 British waters, he had captured and burnt a trading vessel belonging to 
adherents of the Federal party, made prisoners of the crew, and brought them 
to England in irons; this latter course having been taken because they declined to enter the Confederate service.</p>
<p>So much of the well-known facts connected with the Nashville it has been 
necessary to state in order to justify the supposition which we venture to 
lay down, that the whole proceeding, from first to last, was carried on with 
the design of bringing to the test the question of British neutrality. It would
 seem as if this merchantman in ballast was taken and destroyed by a 
Confederate ship of war with the object of exhibiting the character of the 
latter openly before the eyes of the English Government, and coming, as it 
were, red-handed, from the destruction of a Federal vessel, she enters an 
English port, and asks aid and assistance in rendering her complete and 
efficient, and enabled to proceed on a cruise in which, of course she expects
 to meet with other vessels belonging to her enemies and to deal with them in
 the same manner as she treated the Harvey Birch. It is true that she brought
 no prize into a British port; but she brought with her all the symbols and 
signs of a prize. Indeed, she retains property on board of her belonging to 
the captain and passengers of the captured, for the recovery of which these 
latter have endeavoured to invoke the help of English law. Can it be denied 
that, if permission were given to the Nashville to refit and repair, it would 
be a violation of the spirit, if not of the letter—and even this distinction 
is by no means clear—of that part of the Queen's declaration which forbids 
"the adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed 
vessel belonging to either of the contending parties?" No doubt the technical
 answer to this assertion is, that these words apply only to matters which are
 called contraband of war. But the real question is, how would such an act as
 the aiding and comforting—to use an old legal word— of this Confederate 
vessel, fresh from the capture of a Federal vessel, he construed by the 
authorities and the people of the North; and, if the truth were known, does 
not the Captain of the Nashville know that it would be construed in a hostile 
sense; and is not that the very reason why he has brought his ship, with the 
crew of her prize, into Southampton harbour?</p>

<p>Something might be said of the "prononcé" manner in which a 
Confederate agent who has come to England in the Nashville—of whom and of his 
mission we say nothing-has talked of the vast quantities of cotton which are
 lying ready for shipment in the Southern States, and which, of course, only 
await some contingency which would break up or render ineffective the Federal 
blockade. This matter, small in itself, is sufficiently suggestive, and is not without significance in arguing the view we have taken in reference to this
 transaction.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that we are discussing this question, not in
 any spirit of partisanship or with any tendency of feeling or opinion towards 
either party in the United States, but solely, as it stands, as a matter for 
the exercise of the discretion of the Government of this country in carrying 
out that principle of neutrality which has been laid down as our rule of action.
 In that sense, and considering the question only from that point of view in 
coming to a conclusion, it seems to us that the observance of pure and 
unadulterated neutrality demands that no assistance should be given to the 
Nashville. Admitting that all which we have suggested of a crafty device 
having been adopted in order to embroil this country with the Federal Government
 to be without foundation, and indeed we did not for a moment mean to 
insinuate that it should enter into the consideration of the Governvent[sic] in 
practically dealing with the matter, on the true construction of our 
declaration of rigid non-intervention, and, still more, on the principle of 
sound policy, the usual accommodation and appliances which are granted to 
ships of war in our ports ought to be withheld from this Confederate vessel
 of war presenting herself under her peculiar circumstances to the notice of
 the English authorities.</p>

<p>We have waited in vain up to the moment at which we are writing for the 
decision of her Majesty's Government on this subject. For all that has hitherto
 appeared the affair of the Nashville remains unsettled. It is certain that 
some definite and unmistakable rule which would include just such circumstances 
as those which surround the case of the Confederate ship ought to have been
 immediately promulgated by the Government, so that there might be no mistake 
as to the conditions on which armed vessels of either belligerent are henceforth
 to be allowed to enter British harbours, and as to the rights which they are 
to enjoy whilst they remain in harbour. It is true that a still more important
 event may bring the question of the relations which are to exist between this
 country and the Federals into a condition of exactitude; but it is just 
possible that the acts of the Commander of the San Jacinto to our mailsteamer
 Trent may not lead to hostilities between the two countries, and in that case 
the necessity for accurate and unmistakable rules of neutrality will be more 
than ever needed.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> greatest excitement prevailed at Southampton
 last Thursday week by the arrival in the waters there of a large paddle-sloop
 of war, with pennant, and flying the Confederate flag of America. She proved 
to be the Nashville, Captain Peagrim, which ran the blockade at Charleston on 
the 26th of October last; and on her coming to anchor there landed from her, 
with their personal effects, the crew (twenty-nine in number) of the late 
American slip Harvey Birch. This latter was a full-rigged vessel of 1500 tons 
burden, cost 150,000 dollars, and was bound from Havre to New York in ballast,
 but fallen in with by the Nashville on the morning of Tuesday, the 19th inst.,
 and by her captured and destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The following is the statement of her commander, Captain W. H. Nelson:—The
 American ship Harvey Birch, of New York, left Havre on Saturday, the 17th 
inst., bound to New York, in ballast; when in lat 49.6 N., long. 9.52 W., was 
brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagram[sic], late of the 
United States' Navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers
 and crew of the Nashville, who were at once ordered on board the Confederate
 steamer, allowing Captain Nelson and crew to take a few of their effects and
 some fresh provisions. The Harvey Birch was then ordered to to fired by
 Commander Peagrim, who remained alongside until she was burnt to the water's 
edge.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o'clock the Nashville arrived off the entrance of the 
docks, and at one p.m. was moored alongside the north jetty, which was 
literally besieged with spectators. She brought as passengers, under orders of 
the Hon. the Secretary of the Navy, Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton is
 on special duty for the State of North Carolina, and, notwithstanding the
 length of the voyage and the heavy weather experienced throughout her passage,
 which carried away portions of her paddle-boxes. &amp;c., they are in good health.
 He says that there are 750,000 bales of cotton of the old crop, and over
 4,000,000 bales of the new crop, and 50,000,000 dols.' worth of tobacco and
 naval stores ready for shipment.</p>

<p>Captain Peagrim is an old officer of the United States' Navy, and bore a
 conspicuous part in the Mexican War, in the Paraguay and Japan expeditions,
 and during the war waged by the English and French in China. For his 
distinguished services his native State of Virginia voted him, by the unanimous 
voice of the General Assembly of the Legislature, a splendid sword, and Sir 
John Stirling, in his despatches to the Admiralty, makes the following mention
 of him:—"It is impossible to speak too highly of the American co-operating 
party engaged. They were with the Rattler, emulating each other in the thickest 
of the attack. But my warmest thanks in particular are due to Lieutenant 
Peagrim, the American senior officer: his encouragement of the men, and 
coolness under a heavy fire, and determined bravery, when surrounded by a 
persevering and revengeful foe, was conspicuous to all." First Lieutenant 
Fauntleroy was Aide-de-Camp to General Johnson at the battle of Manassas.
 Second Lieutenant Bennett served there in the naval battery, while one 
youngster on board named Cary received his appointment as midshipman in 
the Confederate navy as a reward for distinguished gallantry in the same 
action. The remainder of her company, chiefly Scotch and Irish, consists of
 two mates, eight midshipmen, paymaster, surgeon, engineer, and staff; 
firemen, coal-trimmers, and crew, amounting in all to some sixty men.</p>

<p>The Nashville does not carry a very formidable armament, having only two
 English 12-pounder rifled guns, of Captain Blakeley's manufacture. She is 
of 1100 tons burden and 800-horse power, and was built for the passenger and
 coasting trade between New York and Charleston. Though by no means qualified

 to make a thoroughly efficient ship-of-war, she is superior to many that have
 been adopted into the service of the belligerents. Like most American 
passenger-steamers, she is fitted with a deckhouse and hurricane-deck, which
 would have to be removed before she could he made to answer even tolerably as
 a gun-boat. Her paddle-wheels are, of course, a great drawback to her utility
 for actual warfare, while her machinery, being scarcely below the level of the
 deck, would, in all probability, be disabled by the first shot. She is a good
 model, and, in smooth water and proper trim, her speed is over fifteen knots 
an hour. In spite of her top-hamper the officers speak of her qualities as a 
seaboat, and of her performance during a succession of heavy gales, in terms 
of the highest praise. She is sister ship to the James Adger, Federal
war-sloop, of eight guns.</p>

 Charleston and Savannah. The bombardment commenced on the 7th inst., and, after
 a fight of four hours, the Confederates abandoned the forts at the entrance to 
the inlet, and retreated precipitately. The Federals captured two forts, 
forty-three guns, military equipments, charts, and other valuable papers. The 
Confederates complain that their artillery was badly served, while that of their
 enemies was ably handled. The Federals in the attack lost only one gun-boat, 
whose hands were all saved. On the following day the Federal army, numbering 
15,000 men, landed and established themselves at Beaufort, the seaside resort 
of the platers. The settlement, together with the neighbouring plantations, had
 been totally destroyed by
 the Confederates. Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp. The loss
 of life seems to have been small. The Federals set down their loss at eight; 
that of the Confederates is loosely estimated at a hundred. The small fleet of 
the Confederates, commanded by Commodore Tatnall, took no part in the action. 
Many of them escaped up the inlet leading to the Savannah river, others were run
 ashore, and the remainder were intercepted by the Federal vessels. Of the nine 
Federal vessels which were disabled en route, seven returned to Fortress Monroe,
 and two were wrecked on the coast of North Carolina. One of these contained 
ordnance stores, the other, troops to the number of 75 (who were taken prisoner)
 and horses, of whom all were lost except 15.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND</p>

<p>In Western Virginia the town of Guyandotte, on the Ohio River, was attacked
 by 600 Confederates, and, out of 150 Union troops stationed there, 100 were
 either killed or taken prisoners. The Confederates then retreated, when a loyal
 regiment retook the town and set fire to it, reducing the greater part to
 ashes.</p>

<p>At Piketown, the capital of Pike county, Kentucky, the easternmost county in
 the State, General Nelson (Federal) defeated General Williams's forces and took
 their leaders prisoners. The Secessionists lost 400 killed and a large number
 of prisoners.</p>

<p>A battle took place in Missouri on the 7th, of which the accounts are very 
unsatisfactory. It appears that an expedition left the Federal camp at Cairo,
 Illinois, and landed at Belmont, in Missouri, nearly opposite Columbia. The 
expedition numbered about 3500 men, and made an attack on a Confederate camp,
 numbering, they say, 7000. The enuny were driven out of their entrenchments,
 and their camp destroyed. As the Federals were retiring, booty laden, they 
were taken in the rear by a body of Confederates and compelled to retreat to 
their boats, leaving their booty to the enemy. The Federals admit a  loss of 
from 300 to 500 in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>The army of the West has not advanced beyond Springfield. General Halleck, 
of California, hss been appointed to command it. He is one of the four Major-
Generals of the regular army of the United States. He entered the army in 1839,
 and is now about forty-two years of age. He has written two works on military
 matters, and till recently was practising law in San Francisco. General Fremont,
 on his return to St. Louis, received an ovation from the Germans of that city.
</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOUTHERN COAST.</p>

<p>The late gale, in which the North Briton was lost, raged with almost 
unexampled severity at Hatteras Inlet, and the high tide had overflowed the 
space outside the forts to such an extent that a new channel was being formed
 between them. It was apprehended that the forts might thus be rendered
 untenable. Some clothing and stores taken down from Fortress Monroe for the
 use of the Indiana regiment stationed there were washed away, after being
 landed, and lost. The camp of this regiment was submerged and everything it
 contained washed away. The regiment has since been brought back to Monroe. 
Much sickness prevails among the occupying force on Hatteras.</p>

<p>The Southern journals report the arrival of the Confederate steamer Theodora
 at Savannah with a valuable cargo of stores.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda escaped from Charleston with a cargo of rosin and
 turpentine and 2000 bales of cotton. She was permitted to take a cargo of
 cotton as a mark of gratitude for the valuable supply of arms and ammunition
 she had brought; but, as a general rule, ships running the blockade for Europe
 are not allowed by the people to take cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis and Vice-President Stephens have been re-elected to the
 positions they now severally occupy.</p>

<p>Judah P. Benjamin has been appointed Secretary for War.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEFENCE OF THE COASTS.</p>

<p>Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, has written a caustic reply to Mr.
 Seward's circular letter. He objects to corresponding by slips cut from 
newspapers; he is surprised that the late Congress was not solicited to pass 
appropriations for this purpose if things were more menacing then than now. He
 says that he does not feel himself justified in calling a special Session of 
the State Legislature, while Congress will reassemble a month before the regular
 Session of the fotmer body. The whole subject of coast defences could only be 
dealt with by the general Government. Even if the States were to undertake the 
job, the competition in the money markets for loans between the nation and the
 States would be very injurious to both. Pennsylvania had already advanced
 considerable sums for raising volunteers, and the Federal Government had thrown
 great difficulties in the way of repayment. On the whole, he suggests the 
abandonment of Mr. Seward's plan.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The captain of the slaver Erie had been convicted of the capital offence by 
a New York jury. This is remarkable as being the only conviction of the kind
 since 1820 when the traffic was declared piracy by Congress. Another trial for

 a similar crime is progressing in New Bedford.</p>
<p>In New Jersey the Democratic party had carried the State. In Maryland the 
Union ticket prevailed. To this result the surveillance exercised over the 
polls by General Dix's troops greatly contributed.</p>
<p>A memorial was in circulation in St. Louis, asking Congress to relieve 
Missouri from the national taxes, because her citizens have already suffered 
so seriously from the war.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuters's office yesterday 
(Friday):—</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the steamer City of New York, which arrived at Queenstown on Thursday, 
we have intelligence from New York to the 15th inst:—</p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence of the occupation of Beaufort by the
 Federals. The Charleston papers of the 12th inst. deny that the Federals have
 occupied the town, and state that reinforcements had been sent thither by the
 Confederates who were preparing to defend the town. The Federals, however, 
have occupied Hilton Island, the cotton crop on which was found to have been
 fired by the residents before leaving. The <hi rend="italic">Charleston 
Courier</hi> says there is little cotton stored at or near Beaufort. The New
 York journals state that the Federal Government has not determined whether
 Beaufort shall be made a port of entry. The Southern journals state that
 black flags have been hoisted at Charleston and Savannah as an indication that
 no quarter would be given and that none would be asked.</p>

<p>Eighteen Federal officers, prisoners of war at Richmond, have been selected
 to be hung, should the Federal Government hang the crew of the privateer 
Savannah.</p>

<p>Confirmatory accounts have been received of bridge-burning on a most
 extensive scale by the Union men of East Tennessee, Missouri.</p>

<p>The Federal army has evacuated Springfield, Missouri, returning to St.
 Louis.</p>

<p>It is reported that a United States' war-vessel has captured a large British
 steamer, supposed to be the Fingal, laden with arms, at Key West.</p>

<p>Colonel Cochrane, in addressing his regiment at Washington, urged the arming
 of the Southern slaves against their masters. The Secretary for War was present
 on the occasion, and is reported to have fully endorsed Colonel Cochrane's 
speech.</p>

<p>A despatch from Fortress Monroe reports the arrival of the United States' 
steam-sloop-of-war San Jacinto, with Messrs. Slidell and Mason on board.</p>

<p>The reported battle at Pikeville, Kentucky, was very much exaggerated. There
 were no killed, and the number of wounded and prisoners is reduced to 80 and
 50 respectively.</p>

<p>The report of the capture of the Sumter has not been confirmed.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Startling</hi> news has been brought by the West Indian 
mail steamer La Plata, which arrived at Southampton on Wednesday. On the 8th 
inst. Mr. Slidell, the accredited commissioner to France from the Confederate
 States, and Mr. Mason, engaged on a similar mission to France, with their 
respective secretaries, Messrs. Eustis and M'Farland—who had run the blockade 
at Charleston and arrived at Havannah on the 18th ult., were forcibly taken out
 of the British mail-steamer Trent by the commander of the American steam-frigate San Jacinto.</p>

<p>It appears that on the 7th inst. the Trent sailed in her regular course 
of service from Havnnah for St. Thomas. On the following day, while the Trent
 was approaching a narrow passage in the Bahama Channel, a large steam-ship 
of war, which showed no colours, was seen waiting ahead. The Trent hoisted the 
British ensign, but elicited no responsive display of colours until she had 
approached within about 200 yards of the strange ship, which then fired a shot 
across the Trent's bow, hoisted the United States' flag, and fired a shell to 
leeward of the Trent. Captain Moir, the commander of the Trent, hailed the 
United States' steamer's captain, who replied that he wished to send a boat on
 board. A boat, containing two officers and ten men, boarded the Trent; and 
the boat's commanding officer, Lieutenant Fairfax, demanded to inspect the 
passenger-list, but was refused permission. He then declared that his 
commander, Captain Wilks, of the United States' steam-ship San Jacinto, had 
received information that Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Eustace[sic], and M'Farland were 
among the passengers, and required that they should be given up to him. Captain
 Moir and Commander Williams, the naval officer in charge of the mails, refused
 to comply with the requisition; and the Confederate Commissioners, who were 
standing near, claimed the protection of the British flag under which they 
were sailing. Lieutenant Fairfax said he would take charge of the Trent, and 
made a signal to the San Jacinto, which immediately dispatched several armed 
boats, containing about 100 marines and seamen, who with drawn cutlasses 
boarded the Trent, arrested the Confederate Commissioners, and forced them 
into the boats. While this was doing, Commander Williams protested against the 
act in the following terms:—</p>

<q>In this ship I am the representative of her Majesty's 
Governmsnt, and I call upon the officers of the ship and passengers generally to
 mark my words when, in the name of the British Government, and in distinct 
language, I denounce this as an illegal act, an act in violation of 
international law—an act, indeed, of wanton piracy, which, had we the means 
of defence, you would not dare to attempt.</q>

<p>Mr. Slidell, as he was forced into the boat, requested the Trent's Captain 
to report exactly what had occurred, and declared that he looked to the British 
Government for redress for the outrage committed upon him while he was under 
the protection of the British flag. The American officers next complained that 
they were short of provisions, and asked for a supply for their prisoners, 
which was given by Captain Moir for the "exclusive use " of Messrs. Slidell, 
Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland. Lieutenant Fairfax said that he was ordered to 
take Captain Moir and his papers on board the San Jacinto; but Captain Moir 
refused to go unless he was forcibly removed from his quarterdeck. Lieutenant
 Fairfax thereupon told Captain Moir that he wanted nothing further, and 
ordered his men into the boats, which returned to the San Jacinto, leaving 
the Trent to prosecute her voyage.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has been for some time rumoured that a vessel 
of war bearing the flag of the Federal States of America was lying in the track
 of our West India mail-steamers with the intention of searching them for 
certain commissioners sent by the Confederate States to Europe. The statement 
was received with a good deal of incredulity, and the surprise and indignant 
feeling have been proportionably strong at the intelligence of the course 
pursued by the Commander of the San Jacinto towards the mail-packet Trent. 
Apart from the violation of right and the insult to the British flag which 
are necessarily involved in this transaction, there would appear to have been 
a savageness in the mode in which the proceedings were conducted, from which 
we are inclined to augur that the American officers were actuated by that 
feeling which generally induces persons who are doubtful whether they are in
 the right to overdo their parts. It is quite clear that it needed not the 
additional circumstances of ferocity implied in firing, first round shot and 
then shell, at an unarmed steamer, merely for the purpose of bringing her to;
 or the personal violence which is reported to have been used in the arrest of
 Mr. Slidell in particular, to elicit in a manner not to be mistaken the spirit
 of this country in regard to this proceeding. The most decided indications of
 public opinion have been afforded that England will not tamely submit to have
 her vessels boarded and passengers forcibly torn from beneath the protection
 of her flag. If, as has been asserted, it has been the object and design of 
the Federal Government to force Great Britain into an attitude of hostility, 
without question full reason and justification has been now afforded. Such an 
act, if done under the direct sanction and authority of the Executive at
 Washington, speaks for itself. Neither of the parties can desire a more 
complete "casus belli." It remains to be seen whether the proceedings of the 
commander of the San Jacinto will be adopted or disavowed by his Government. 
It is well known that American naval officers have been always somewhat hasty 
in asserting what they conceive to be the rights of their country; and in many
 cases it has been necessary on the part of those representatives of other 
countries with whom they have come into collision to exercise great forbearance.
 When the matter is looked at, considered with that coolness and calmness which
 its importance requires, it seems almost impossible to suppose that so 
flagrant a trespass on the rights which by international law are covered by a
 flag can have been deliberately planned by the American Government, or that 
when temperate but firm demands made for the disavowal of conduct on the face 
of it so unjustifiable on all grounds but one—that of seeking occasion for a 
quarrel—that disavowal will not be given. Notwithstanding the indignant feeling
 which has been evinced in this country on the receipt of this intelligence, 
there is no doubt that the gravity of the consequences which may ensue will be 
acknowledged by every Englishman. It is to be hoped that in the Northern States
 of America a corresponding feeling will prevail.</p>

<p>By the capture of Beaufort, the summer resort of Carolinian planters, the 
United States' Government have fully avenged the insult of Fort Sumter. In 
April the sole remaining star-spangled banner on South Carolinian Soil was 
ignominiously lowered. In November the United States' flag has again been 
hoisted there, while that of the Confederates trails in the dust. But the war,
 in its ever-expanding magnitude, has long since outgrown the puerile issue on
 which it was commenced. The passionate resolve to redress an outrage inflicted
 on the Federal flag has long since deepened into a purpose of conquest. It 
would be as chimerical to hope that this success would tend to placate the North 
as that the forcible opening of a Southern port will lead to a renewal of the 
Southern trade with Europe.</p>

<p>This time, at least, the blow has fallen in the right place. Hitherto the 
border States—Maryland, Virginia (East and West), Kentucky, and Missouri—have 
alone felt the ravages which attend the shock of invading armies. Yet all these 
regions, except Eastern Virginia, are still in the Union. It has been the fate
 of the border Slave States to act as a sort of breakwater to the fury of the
 Northern storm behind which the revolutionary Gulf States dwelt in safety and 
comparative repose. On the Northern frontier of Secessia was the "shell" with 
which the far South incased its softer and more vital parts. All attempts to
 break through that shell by a front attack have hitherto failed. But the fleet
 has accomplished what the unaided army could not. South Carolina is the very 
heart and focus of the revolution, and the Isle of Anglesea of old was not more 
given up to Druidical worship than are the sea islands, on one of which the
 Federals are encamped, consecrated to slave-grown products. Negroes, rice, 
and the finest sorts of cotton—these are the pride and glory of Beaufort county,
 situated midway between Charleston and Savannah, the two principal southern 
ports on the Atlantic coast. Full five-sixths of the population of Beaufort 
county are slaves.</p>

<p>The angry North has at last condescended to carry the war into "Africa." 
In the border Slave States, where slavery is not of vigorous growth, the 
Administration and every General, except the deposed Fremont, have been 
sedulous to deprive the war of an anti-slavery character. But in this thickly-settled region, where slavery flourishes rankly, the Northern army of 
occupation must, in the very nature of things, and in spite even of the 
ingrained prejudices of the men composing it, become an instrument of 
emancipation. Already the telegraph tells us " Large numbers of negroes came 
into the Federal camp." These late chattels will not be restored to their 
owners. The Federal Government, which, in the border States, restores fugitives
 to "loyal" owners, rightly conjectures there are  no loyal proprietors in 
South Carolina, and at length allows its camp to be a gladsome City of Refuge
 to all who may flock thither. The slaves of this region, removed by a whole
 heaven from Canada, had no hope of escape from thraldom but death. A host of 
men from the North, contending for empire and a flag, but stung by the repulses 
at Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, suddenly appear in the midst of the negroes, 
consent to abandon their practice of slave-catching, and fastidiously resign 
themselves to the inevitable consequence that a chance of freedom will thereby 
be opened to a more or less numerous band of a downtrodden race. Had the 
midsummer cry of "Forward to Richmond!" availed we should never have heard of 
this autumnal invasion of the South Carolina coast. Adversity has taught the 
North to conquer one poor iota of her prejudices. It is this aspect of the camp
 at Beaufort which will give it an interest in the eyes of the onlooking world 
superior to that attaching to to[sic] Fortress Monroe, Hatteras Inlet, and Fort 
Pickens.</p>

<p>The second success of the fleet will be highly welcome to the Administration
 and the Commander-in-Chief, for two reasons—one political and one military. 
The Northern people had again grown impatient at the inaction or disasters of 
the two armies on the Lower and Upper Potomac. They demanded a victory, and 
demanded it in vain. General M'Clellan obstinately inculcated "patience," that
 virtue so difficult for an excited Democracy to observe. The universal feeling
 was, "Something must be done; we want some equivalent for our money and other
 sacrifices." Popular enthusiasm threatened to flag, the subscriptions to the 
national loan fell off, and murmurs against the Administration began to make
 themselves heard. The achievements of the fleet will calm this dangerous mood 
of the public mind and give the Commander-in-Chief a few more weeks to mature
 his plans. In a military point of view, the 15,000 men at Beaufort will operate
 as an invaluable diversion of the enemy's forces. The invaders are within 
sixteen miles' distance of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, whose wooden
 bridges and trestle-work are easily destructible, and whose iron tires if once
 thrown into the river cannot now be replaced. The Confederates have to make 
head against a force of, say, 350,000 Federals pressing upon them on a line of
 1500 miles, stretching from the Atlantic to the Missouri. Up to the present 
time they have done so with a fair amount of success. But can the Confederate 
Generals create new armies to watch every body of men whom the Federal fleet 
may throw upon their almost undefended coast? Or can they detach a sufficient
 number of men from the frontier without leaving the road to Richmond, 
Nashville, and Memphis open to their foes? It is evident that General Scott, 
for one, does not so believe, for his last words to the New Yorkers were, 
that by April or May next the "rebellion" would be surely crushed.</p>

<p>If the South still preserves the advantage of greater earnestness and 
singleness of purpose, the superior financial strength of the North begins to 
tell. The appeal of the planters to the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury 
and the reply thereto are signs that the South is "shortwinded" in this respect.
 Doubtless this difficulty would vanish if the South could make sale of her 
cotton, rice, and tobacco; but here the Federal fleet sails in and pitilessly 
relegates the South to her native resources. The Federal Government is well 
supported by the banks of the three chief cities of the North, and the people 
relieve the banks of the seven-and-three-tenths per cent Treasury notes nearly,
 but not quite, so fast as they are issued. Northern patriotism, as expressed 
in <pb n="541"/>the readiness to take the Government loan, has by no means 
equalled the superabundant enthusiasm we are accustomed to witness in France 
on similar occasions, but seems to have exceeded the lagging offerings of the 
Italians for their late loan. American national sentiment, valued in dollars, 
stands midway between that of France and Italy. The immense quantities of grain
 and flour which the North has all this year been selling to British and French
 purchasers keep the exchange in favour of the Americans, and enable their
 banks, in spite of the stoppage of the usual export from the South, to retain 
the specie in their vaults. Thus confidence is maintained; the banks have not 
suspended specie payments; and, notwithstanding Mr. Seward's uncalled-for and 
reckless circulars, Government and railroad stocks of loyal States are higher
 now than they have been since the Presidential election.</p>

<p>In the mean time, among the mountains of Western Virginia a revolutionary 
movement has been progressing which is independent, to some extent, of both 
North and South. The people of thirty-nine contiguous counties of the trans-
Allegheny section of Virginia, occupying an area about twice the size of 
Wales, and numbering 282,000, of whom only 9000 are slaves, have declared their
 independence of the State of Virginia, and, organised themselves, with great 
unanimity, into a new state, called Kanawha, from the river of that name, which
 traverses it. Although the Kanawhans occupy a territory of great value to the 
United States, and although the region has been liberated from Confederate
 armies by M'Clellan and Rosencranz, yet this demonstration meets with no 
favour from the Federal Government, which cannot now afford to countenance 
the right of revolution, even when it is made in behalf of the Union and the 
old flag. Separated as these people are from Eastern Virginia by physical
 barriers similar to those which divide Savoy from Italy, and united to the 
adjacent free-labour States by similar pursuits and moral and political 
sympathies, it is very improbable, come what may, that the old territorial 
arrangements will ever be restored. But the incident furnishes another proof 
that the air of America was charged with revolution, and that the time was 
ripe for a recombination of the heterogeneous elements of which the United 
States for the last forty years have been composed.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Much</hi> interest is felt in the recent determination 
of the Federal Government to fortify its coast, lake, and frontier line, as 
conveyed in Mr. Seward's instructions of the 14th of October. The American 
Government, however, have for some time past been repairing and enlarging the 
system of fortifications on the Canadian frontier. One of the strongest of the 
enlarged works is Fort Montgomery, at Rowse's Point, at the head of Lake 
Champlain. This fort has been nicknamed Fort Blunder, because erected upon 
British soil, afterwards given up, under treaty, to the United States. The fort 
has been considerably enlarged, and is now nearly completed. It will mount
 sixty-five guns in position, and twenty-five en barbette. It is protected on 
the land side by a moat and rampart of earth; and, on the whole, it is a very 
formidable work. Rowse's Point is about thirty-eight miles from Montreal, and 
upon the main line of railway communication between Boston, New York, and 
Canada. Lake Champlain, which lies between the States of New York and Vermont, 
extending for four miles into Lower Canada, is 105 miles in length, north to 
south, its breadth varying from ten miles to half a mile. It contains numerous 
islands, receives several rivers, and discharges its superfluous waters by the 
Richelieu river into the St. Lawrence. This lake was the centre of  many 
important military operations during the revolutionary war, and now forms an 
important medium of commerce.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> British public has been agitated by intense 
excitement during the past week by the apparent imminence of a rupture of 
friendly relations between this country and America. To the facts which have 
occasioned this state of things, and to the light in which they may be viewed 
by the law of nations, we shall presently advert. Before doing so, however, we
 gladly recognise the possibility, and express the hope, faint though it be, 
that the matter in dispute may be satisfactorily settled, even before the 
publication of our present Number. Our remarks are intended to bear upon the 
facts as they stood at the moment of our going to press; and should any 
authentic information from the other side of the Atlantic reach our shores 
before these pages are in the hands of our readers which will render the 
following comments unnecessary, because untimely, none will rejoice more 
heartily than ourselves at being "a day after the fair."</p>

<p>The fact of the case lie in a very narrow compass; the statement of them, 
although hitherto <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi> only, rests upon the 
concurrent testimony of several witnesses, and may fairly be assumed as 
trustworthy. They are so well known that it will not be necessary for us to 
give more than the barest outline of them. Messrs. Slidell and Mason, 
Commissioners of the Confederate States of America to France and England, 
together with their Secretaries, having succeeded in evading the blockade,
 and in reaching the neutral port of Havannah, engaged berths on board the
 mail-steamer Trent, with a view to proceed to Europe by the ocean
 mail-steamer La Plata from St. Thomas. Being on neutral territory,
 and cotemplating a voyage in neutral ships, they made no
 secret of their intentions, nor of the official capacity in which they were
 acting. While these gentlemen were waiting at Havannah for the sailing of the 
Trent, the San Jacinto, an armed sloop in the service of the Federal Government
 at Washington, called at the port, having just left her station on the coast
 of Africa. Captain Wilks, the commander of the San Jacinto, under general 
instructions, it is presumed, from his own Government, for the time was too 
short to admit of special insructions, determined upon intercepting the 
Commissioners on their way to St. Thomas, and for this purpose started from 
Havannah to the Bahama Channel, a narrow roadstead through which the Trent 
would have to pass. As soon as the British mail-steamer hove in sight the San
 Jacinto made all ready to stop, search, and, if resisted, to sink her. The 
first step taken by the Captain of the American cruiser was to fire a shot 
across the bows of the Trent, and to show her colours; but, as the British 
steamer did not heed the summons, his next proceeding was to fire a shell, 
which exploded within a hundred yards of her. The Trent, being unarmed, 
immediately brought to, and Lieutenant Fairfax was sent on board to demand 
a list of the passengers. This having been refused, the Lieutenant said he 
had good reason to know that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, and their secretaries, 
were among the passengers, and he required that they should be given up to him.
 On the refusal of Captain Moir to comply with this requisition three boats' 
crews were dispatched from the Federal sloop, and boarded the Trent, cutlass 
in hand. Further resistance on the part of Captain Moir was of course out of 
the question; and, under formal protest, the four gentlemen were seized and 
carried off as prisoners to the San Jacinto, and the Trent allowed to proceed 
on her voyage.</p>
 
<p>These facts have been laid before the law officers of the Crown, who have 
decided that the Captain of the San Jacinto has committed a breach of 
international law, and a dispatch from the British Government is already on 
its way to Lord Lyons, instructing him, it has been said, to demand the 
restoration of the captured gentlemen to the protection from which they have 
been illegally taken, and a disavowal and apology on the part of the Federal
 Government for the act of their own officer. If this demand be not complied 
with, it is rumoured that our Minister at Washington will forthwith return 
home;<pb n="568"/> Mr. Adams, the American Minister at London, will be furnished
 with his passports; and diplomatic relations between the two countries will be
 broken off, in anticipation of war.</p>

<p>The ground upon which the law officers of the Crown rest their decision 
appears to be the only ground which could have been safely taken. The right 
of the San Jacinto to stop and search the Trent for contraband of war is not 
disputed. It is a right which Great Britain, as a foremost maritime power, 
has done her utmost to establish. The inclusion of persons as well as things 
within the category of contraband is also undoubted, although it remains a moot
 point (which, however, we shall not discuss) whether the diplomatic agents of
 one belligerent can be lawfully seized by another while proceeding in a 
neutral vessel between two neutral ports. It is a nice legal question, 
requiring for its decision the deliberate and solemn adjudication of a prize 
court. That which seems to be clear is that commanders of ships are not 
authorised by the law of nations, and cannot safely be permitted, to act on
 board neutral vessels on their own private views of law. The Captain of the 
San Jacinto, even on the hypothesis that Messrs. Slidell and Mason came within
 the description of contraband, was bound to carry the Trent into the nearest
 port, there to await the decision of a regularly constituted prize court. Had 
such decision been in his favour, we should have had no illegality of which to
 complain; had it been against him he would have been responsible for whatever 
damage he had inflicted upon the proprietors or the passengers of the Trent, in
 consequence of her interruption and detention. It may he quite true that by 
pursuing a legal course, instead of the high-handed one upon which he acted, he 
would have subjected the owners, crew, and passengers of the Trent to much more
 serious annoyance than they have now to complain of. But it is also true that 
by allowing the precedent we should open a wide door for every variety of 
insult to our mercantile marine from the ignorance, caprice, or passion of
 American commanding officers. Neutral vessels are not to be adjudged guilty 
of violating the laws of neutrality by every petty officer who has the 
authority and the power to arrest them. It might be very convenient, no doubt, 
in certain imaginable instances, for a police-constable to seize goods 
suspected to be stolen and simply to hand them over to the reputed owner. 
It would save an immensity of annoyance in some cases; but it is judged to be 
safer, on the whole, to refer the decision to a court of law, where evidence 
can be given on both sides and impartially sifted, and where verdict and 
sentence have a chance of being delivered with due and dispassionate 
deliberation. Now, international law is founded mainly upon the same 
principles of justice as those which are embodied in municipal law; and the 
very existence of prize courts rests upon the implication that between 
belligerents and neutrals all questions that arise shall be decided, not by an 
individual and private but by a public interpretation of the rights
 respectively of both parties.</p>

<p> But, believing, as we do, that a gross and, if sanctioned by submission, 
a dangerous infraction of international law and the rights of neutrals has 
been committed by the commander of the San Jacinto, we see many incidents 
connected with the case that should induce Great Britain to present her claim
 to reparation with as much calmness, considerateness, and forbearance as a 
due regard for the honour of her flag and the safety of her commercial marine 
will admit of, one or two of the most important of which we proceed, in the 
interest of peace, to submit to the judgment of our readers.</p>

<p>In the first place, then, it deserves to be borne in mind that we are as 
yet without any trustworthy evidence that the act of Captain Wilks was done in 
obedience to instructions received from the Federal Government at Washington. 
The probabilities all lie the other way. The San Jacinto had but just left the 
coast of Africa, and had put into Havannah before it was possible for her to 
have had recent communications from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet. It was there and 
then only that he could have ascertained the intention of Messrs. Slidell and 
Mason to go out by the Trent, and no sufficient interval was left him to submit
 his project to the judgment of the Cabinet. Mr. Adams, the American Minister 
in London, volunteered, immediately on the arrival of the news by the La Plata,
 a statement of his conviction that the Federal Government knew nothing whatever
 of the transaction until after it was consummated. The rumours which have 
reached us from America since the arrival of the prisoners at Fort Monroe 
lend additional probability to this opinion. Captain Wilks was stated to have
 hinted in the course of a conversation with General Wool at the possible 
alternative of being cashiered for his act—a proof, if true, that he had acted 
without authority. Lord Lyons, our Minister at Washington, is reported to have 
expressed his opinion that Messrs. Sidell and Mason would be given up to 
England. The next arrival may bring us an assurance that the Federal Government
 have honourably declined to take advantage of the wrong committed by their own
 officer, and the amicable relations of the two Governments may be 
re-established upon a sounder basis than before.</p>

<p>In the next place, it behoves us to remember that the rights of belligerents,
 as against neutrals, a strained and unofficial interpretation of which has led
 to the present disagreeable dilemma, are mainly, if not solely, rights which 
England herself has persisted in establishing, not merely in the face of many 
protests, but even to the extremity of war. We are not, therefore, in a 
position to fire up in anger, or to proceed in haste or in harshness to the 
last fearful arbitrement in vindication of the wrong we believe ourselves to 
have received. And, in the last place, we may well make some allowance for the 
difficulties which surround the Lincoln Administration, and, if we cannot 
safely pass by such an offence as that perpetrated by Captain Wilks, we might, 
at any rate, act as courteously and considerately as possible in the 
prosecution of our demands. In this spirit and with these views we hope her 
Majesty's Government are dealing, and will deal, with the matter. Hitherto the
 great majority of the people of England have kept their natural excitement 
under creditable restraint, and we firmly believe will be prepared to make any 
sacrifice of feeling, not inconsistent with national honour, in order to avert 
a war with their American kin. We earnestly trust that their forbearance will 
meet with its due reward, and that by disavowing the act of Captain Wilks, and 
surrendering the Southern Commissioners to the hands from which they were 
summarily and rudely taken, the Federal Government will save themselves, the 
world, and us from hostilities which, while they would disgrace humanity, would
 bring nothing but evil to either party.</p>

<p rend="center">OPINIONS OF THE FRENCH PRESS ON THE SEIZURE OF<lb/> 
MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>

<p>The whole of the Paris press, and more especia1ly the semi-official journals,
 warmly espouse the side of England in her quarrel with the American Federal 
Government.</p>

<p>An article in the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>, written in a semi-official 
style, after pointing out how deeply France is interested in the American 
question, proposes that, in case of a rapture between England and America, 
France should coincide with England in any recognition of the Southern 
Confederacy, and, in order to render any resistance on the part of the Northern 
States out of the question, unite her naval forces with those of England. 
"At this moment (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>) the fate of two peoples
 and perhaps the repose of the world, is in the hands of the Cabinet of 
Washington. Its resolutions may lead to events of incalculable importance; but 
in any case we cannot but admit that England is right to act as she is doing. 
We will go further—she is merely accomplishing a rigorous duty, commanded by 
the circumstances, and all Europe will approve her conduct." In another article
 headed "How is France to act?" the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> expresses 
more decided views:—"In our opinion (says the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi>) 
it is difficult for her to remain indifferent in presence of a violation of 
international law which concerns all maritime nations. We believe that very 
likely the Northern States will refuse to accede to the demands made by England;
 in that case we may presume that war will be immediately declared, and the 
first act of hostility will be the recognition of the Southern
States. ... We are convinced that the war between the two countries will be an interminable one, but, on the other hand, we cannot remain idle spectators of a struggle 
between North America and England. It is quite clear that it is not our duty to
 avenge the wrongs of England, but the recognition of the South by that Power, 
which would imply a final separation from the United States, could not be 
regarded as an isolated act, and would impose upon France the necessity of 
assuming a decisive attitude in this question. The result would be that two 
great maritime Powers of Europe might be drawn into a common action with the 
same identical political object; and, that being the case, as we have observed 
before, President Lincoln, by provoking an act of brutality, may perhaps have
 acted with foresight by preparing a separation which he can neither propose 
nor accept." In another article the <hi rend="italic">Patrie</hi> seems to 
foreshadow a disposition on the part of the French Government to recognise the 
Southern Confederacy if England should set the example of recognition.</p>

<p>With regard to the affair of the Trent the <hi rend="italic">Pays</hi> 
says:—"The irritation excited in England, and the opinion of the law officers
 of the Crown, will perhaps make the Washington Cabinet reflect seriously, and
 induce it to offer the fullest reparation to the British Government. If Mr.
 Lincoln refuses reparation for the insult to the Trent, the entire 
responsibility of the consequences will rest with him."</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel</hi> says:—"In fact, it is impossible 
that the Americans should not understand how irregular is the arrest of MM. 
Slidell and Mason on board the Trent; how contrary it is to the law of nations; 
and how prejudicial the consequences of this act would be to themselves. It 
would be the consecration of the 'right of search,' against which they have 
always protested, and which was one of the chief causes of the war they 
themselves waged with England in 1812-a right of search exercised not only on 
commercial vessels but on ships of war, for the mail-steamers are Royal 
vessels, having on board a Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, and their officers 
wear the uniform of the British Navy. By declaring contraband of war simple 
passengers with or without a diplomatic mission the Americans strike a mortal
 blow against the privileges of neutral States, which it is to their interest
 more than to any one else to see respected."</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Débats</hi> thinks that the neglect of Captain
 Wilks to seize the despatches on board the Trent was a fatal oversight.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Temps</hi> thinks that the Emperor Napoleon has
 tendered, or will tender, his good offices or mediation for the settlement
 of the dispute.</p>

<p rend="center">GENERAL SCOTT ON THE AFFAIR OF THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The United States' Consul has communicated to the French papers a letter of 
General Scott (who is now in Paris), in which he declares there is no truth in 
the report that the Cabinet of Washington had ordered the seizure of the 
Southern Commissioners, even if under the protection of a neutral flag. He is 
quite ignorant of the decision of his Government, but he says it is necessary 
to preserve good relations between America and England. "I hope," continues 
General Scott, "that Earl Russell and Mr. Seward will agree on a solution of 
the question whether the persons who were arrested on board the Trent were 
contraband of war or not. If they were agents of the rebels it will be difficult
 to convince even impartial minds that they were less contraband of war than 
rebel soldiers or cannons." In conclusion, General Scott expresses a conviction 
that a war between America and England cannot take place without more serious 
provocations than those at present given.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The Toronto <hi rend="italic">Lender</hi>, the most influential organ of the 
Canadian Ministry, characterises the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell as 
"the most offensive outrage which Brother Jonathan has ever dared to perpetrate
 on the British flag. It strikes at the root of British authority, and affirms 
a right on the part of the Northern States to which the meanest nation in 
Christendom could not honourably submit. We assume that Lord Lyons will at 
once demand from the Washington Government a disavowal of the act of their 
Commodore and the release of Messr. Mason and Slidell. Not to assume this, 
would be to suppose that Britain is indifferent to the rights and honour of 
her flag."</p>

<p>Some months ago the Perthshire, a large colonial vessel of 840 tons, the 
property of Mr. William Gray, of Hartlepool, was boarded without legal warrant 
by the United States' steamer Massachusetts, off the American coast, on the 
alleged ground that the Perthshire had violated the blockade of the Southern 
ports. The case was represented by the British Minister to the Government at 
Washington, and Earl Russell has informed the owner that the President will

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The United States' Navy</hi>—The statistics of
 the United States' Navy show ten ships of the line, the youngest of which was 
built in 1840. Four were still on the stocks, four were at Norfolk when that 
port was abandoned. There are ten sailing-frigates of 50 guns: two were built
 in 1797; not one is of 1500 British tons burden; the youngest were built in
 1855. There are twenty sloops of from 24 to 16 guns: the youngest was built in
 1854. They are too small for their armament. The steam navy is the kernel of 
the naval force of the Federal Government. It consists of five screw-frigates 
built, and one building. These are of the Niagara and Minnesota school. There 
are six first-class steam-sloops. Of these the crack ship is the Brooklyn, 25
 guns, and to this class belongs the San Jacinto, 13 guns. There are three
 paddle-steamers—the Powhattan represents the class; and eight-second class
 screw steam-sloops and one paddle-wheel—all except the last, built since 
1855; they carry from 6 to 3 guns. The third-class screw-sloops, four in number, carry more guns—one 8, the others 5. There are four paddle-steamers, two of 3 
guns and two of 1. Three steam-tenders make up the Navy, consisting,
<hi rend="italic">on paper</hi>, of a total of 10 line-of-battle ships, 10 
frigates, 20 sloops, 3 brigs, and 3 troop-ships—all these are sailers; of 
6 screw-frigates, of 18 screw and 8 paddle-wheel sloops, and of 3 steam-tenders.
 The Federal Government has increased the list by 100—merchant ships fitted out
 to maintain the blockade.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the Cunard steamer Persia we have received New
 York journals of the 20th ult.</p>

<p>The principal subject of interest is the reception of the news of the capture
 of Messrs. Mason and Slidell on board the British steamer Trent. The American 
account of the affair agrees with that of Captain Moir, except in that it is 
represented that all the documents of Messrs. Mason and Shidell were seized. 
It is also admitted that Captain Wilks, of the San Jacinto, acted without 
orders from Washington, that ship having only just returned to the West Indies 
from Africa. The news of the capture was received with great joy by the people
 of the large cities, although the means by which it was made caused a fall of
 stocks in Wall-street. The captives were transferred from New York to Fort 
Warren, near Boston. Commodore Wilks is the same officer who commanded the
 United States' exploring expedition in 1838-42, the account of which was given
 to the world in five large volumes.</p>

<p rend="center">WHAT THE NORTHERN JOURNALS SAY CONCERNING THE SEIZURE OF<lb/>
 MESSRS. SLIDELL AND MASON.</p>
<p>The journals are full of quotations from Vattel, Wheaton, Phillimore, and 
Kent, and of decisions of Lord Stowell, to prove that the dipatches, and the 
Commissioners who carried them, were "contraband of war," subjecting the vessel
 to the penalty of capture and condemnation in a Prize Court. The practice of 
taking British seamen out of American merchant ships at the commencement of 
this century is cited as estopping Great Britain from any right to object. The
 cutting out of the Caroline from New York waters, by Sir Allan McNab in 1837, 
is brought forward, the circumstances that preceded and justified that act being
 omitted by the journal that cites it. Mr. George Sumner, of Boston, mentions 
the capture of Mr. Laurens, the American Ambassador, in 1780, as having been
 made from a Dutch vessel, which, however, is erroneous, the vessel being an 
American one. The journals do not seem generally to anticipate that the 
irregularity of allowing the Trent to proceed on her way would give cause of 
offence to the British Government and nation. They regard it as an act of
 kindness on the part of Commodore Wilks. Of the New York journals, only the
 <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi> doubted whether the Commissioners
 were contraband, and called them "political prisoners under the protection of
 a neutral flag," whose seizure was unjustifiable, and ought to be repudiated 
by the United States' Government. The two organs of the French population in
 New York regarded the seizure as a breach of international law. The 
<hi rend="italic">Boston Advertiser</hi> preserves its usual moderation and 
judgment, and "inclines to the belief" that the despatches and Ambassadors 
were contraband of war. The rest of the journals of the three principal cities,
 which are written in the English language, treat the matter as one too plain 
for doubt. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> is as brutal in its utterances as 
usual; the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> 
the <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Commerce</hi>,
 and the <hi rend="italic">Evening Post</hi> simply reflect the feeling of the 
people, and affect to believe that England, far from remonstrating, will
 "applaud the gallant act of Lieutenant Wilks, so full of spirit and good sense,
 and such an exact imitation of the policy she has always stoutly defended and 
invariably pursued."</p>

<p rend="center">A VIOLATION OF NEW GRANADIAN NATIONAL RIGHTS.</p>
<p>General Sumner, in command of a regiment of the regular army of the United
 States, seized three returning Californians on board the Panama steamer on a
 charge of "Southern proclivities." On their arrival at the Isthmus the Governor
 protested against the passage of these political prisoners across the soil of 
New Granada. General Sumner, backed by the force of his regiment, refused to 
forego his design, and the Governor contented himself with a protest.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERANT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>
<p>The reports of Captain Dupont and Brigadier-General Sherman have appeared. 
The capture of the forts was made with the loss of fifteen killed and wounded
 on the Federal side. The loss of the means of debarkation forced the
 Commanders to abandon their projected attack by land. The negroes had sacked 
Beaufort and were very favourably disposed towards "the Yankees." Many of the
 negroes who would not flee with their masters to the woods were shot by their
 owners, and this cruel proceeding had greatly exasperated the survivors.</p>
<p>Another naval expedition, under General Butler, was in an active state of 

preparation at Boston.</p>
<p>General Dix has landed 4000 troops on the eastern shore of Virginia, and has
 issued a proclamation guaranteeing constitutional rights to loyal inhabitants. 
It is reported that the Federals were well received by the people of Accomac and
 Northampton counties.</p>
<p>The Federals have now 480,000 men in arms, lacking only 20,000 of the numter
 authorised by Congress.</p>


<p rend="center">THE ARMING OF THE SLAVES.</p>
<p>Colonel Cochrane, a lifelong pro-slavery Democrat, in an address to his 
regiment, proclaimed "the military necessity of the emancipation of the slaves."
 The Secretary of War (Mr. Cameron), who was present, followed with a short but 
significant speech to this effect:—</p>
<p>Soldiers!—It is too late for me to make you it speech to-night, but I will
 say that I heartily approve every sentiment uttered by your noble commander. 
The doctrines which he has laid down I approve as if they were my own words. 
They are my sentiments—sentiments which will not only lead you to victory, but 
which will in the end reconstruct this our glorious Federal Constitution. It is
 idle to talk about treating with these rebels upon their own terms. We must 
meet them as our enemies, treat them as enemies, and punish them as enemies, 
until they shall learn to behave themselves. Every means which God has placed 
in our hands it is our duty to use for the purpose of protecting ourselves. I 
am glad of the opportunity to say here, what I have already said elsewhere, in
 these few words, that I approve the doctrines this evening enunciated by 
Colonel Cochrane.</p>
<p>General Burnside, of Rhode Island, and Senator Wilson, of Massachusetts, 
the colleague of Charles Sumner, have made declarations of similar import. The 
latter said:—</p>
<p>It was poor policy to manage the war otherwise. It was useless to send our 
men from their firesides, their workshops, and their farms to die upon the 
Southern soil if the cause of the war were not removed, and the power that 
brought on the conflict without a cause, and aimed at the destruction of the
 Republic, remained untouched in the chief source of its strength.</p>
<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>Five bridges on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad have been burned by the
 Unionists of East Tennessee. This line is the most important line of
 communication between Virginia and the South-Western States.</p>
<p>Colonel Corcoran, of the 69th (Irish) Regiment, has bean thrown into gaol as 
a hostage for the privateersman condemned in New York, and twelve other officers
 are designated as hostages for the safety of the rest of the privateer's crew.
</p>
<p>The Georgia planters have held a convention in which it was resolved that if 
the present cotton crop remain unsold they will not plant any cotton next year.
</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>The New York banks have asked for and obtained a postponement of the time 
when they will be called upon to take the third 50,000,000 dollars of the 
national loan until the 1st of January next.</p>
<p>Another condemnation of a culprit for engaging in the slave trade has taken
 place. The trial was held in New Bedford.</p>
<p>Edwin James has been engaged by the New York <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi>,
 a weekly newspaper of no high standing, to write autobiographical experiences.
 The editor offers him 2000 dollars for a series of articles of this kind.</p>

<p>A numerously-attended meeting of American residents in Paris assembled a few 
days ago, at the Hotel Westminster, to present their respects to General Scott, 
on the occasion of his arrival in that city. His Excellency Mr. Dayton, the 
United States' Minister, in addressing the General on behalf of his countrymen 
in Paris, assured him of their respect for himself personally, and their high
 appreciation of the value of his long services to his country, referring 
particularly to the activity and energy displayed in his recent loyal defence
 of the capital when threatened by the Confederates of the South, and
 declaring that his countrymen would ever cherish in their hearts a grateful
 recollection of his name. He expressed their regret at the feeble state of 
his health, and their wishes for his speedy restoration; and trusted
that, on his return home, he would find his country once more happy
and united, and more prosperous than ever. General Scott, who seemed much affected at the
 compliment paid him, replied in suitable terms.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist in the Federal Camp on the 
Potomac continues to forward to us Illustrations of noteworthy incidents in
 connection with the civil war raging in that part of the States. Four of these,
 respecting which he writes as follows, are given on the accompanying pages:—Fifty miles below Washington the Confederates have constructed some formidable
 batteries on the Virginia shore of the Potomac, opposite to a place known as 
Budd's Ferry. Among the series of sketches forwarded you will find one showing
 Budd's house, and a small earthwork mounting two 10-pound Parrott guns, which 
the Federalists have there in position. Preparations are being made at the same 
point for attack on the Confederate batteries over the river, three exceedingly
 heavy ones having been unmasked. During my visit a dozen or so of small 
schooners of light draught successfully <pb n="571"/>

ran the blockade by hugging the Maryland shore closely, where the water shoals
 considerably. Heavy vessels dare not risk it, as the deep channel lies right 
under the batteries, and the consequence is the blockade of the Potomac may be
 looked upon as effective. We on our side watched the little ships anxiously as
 they came within range of the enemy's guns, which they no sooner did than a 
terrible fire of shot and shell opened upon them, not one, however being 
struck seriously, and all enabled to keep their course down river. We, the 
spectators, ran probably more risk than the vesse1s, for many of the shells came
 over to our neighbourhood, bursting in close proximity to where we stood. Our
 turn then came, and we gave them a few rounds from the tiny Parrotts, pitching
 the 10-pound shells right into their works, and peppering a steamer, one of 
the Confederate navy, until they were glad to haul her into Quantico Creek. The
 river at this point is a mile and three quarters in breadth. My "Reconnaissance
 with General Sickles in the Bed of the Potomac" was a most remarkable ride, for
 nearly the whole time we had to wade to our horses' girths in the river itself,
 sometimes even swimming, the banks being impracticable in places. The neighbour
 hood is Indian Head, close by the batteries.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> one topic of the day is the great question 
whether American democracy will permit American statesmanship to do right. No 
other subject has any claim to present discussion; for it is impossible to talk 
of social reforms, or other of the ordinary themes of the journalist, when 
England, making a stand for her honour, but in nowise irritated or unreasonable,
 awaits the tidings whether the New Year is to be inaugurated by the signal for 
war. At another time it might be interesting to hear that the Mexicans have 
resolved not to risk a struggle with the great Powers that have united to put 
down piracy and ruffianism in Mexico, and to assert the rights of civilisation. 
We might be glad to know that there was a probability of these objects being 
effected without bloodshed, and we might urge upon the Governments to be in no 
hurry to believe in the value of promises extorted by fear, and which must be 
rendered valuable by material guarantees, and by the condign punishment of those
 who have been indulging for years in tyranny and robbery. But an expedition 
which excited some interest a month ago may now sail almost unmarked, except 
that England casts a not unsatisfied glance at her own share in the ships, and 
is glad that they are sailing westward. The Indian news is far from 
uninteresting, but, except that we shall be glad to hear that the Indian cotton
 crop is likely to be quadrupled, we have not
 much attention for the Oriental Empire. On Christmas Day many of the gathered 
households of the country may be graver than is their wont at that season.</p>
<p rend="center">The mother looks on her son to-day<lb/> 
With a troubled heart and eye, <lb/>
And the maiden's brow hath a shade of care<lb/>
'Mid the gleam of her golden hair;</p>
<p>for news, like that of the German legend, that "the Wild Huntsman hath gone 
by," and that war is coming, may sadden the homes of England. Yet throughout 
the length and breadth of the land there is but one cry—We must uphold the old 
flag.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Number last week contained an account of the
 forcible seizure of Messrs. Slidell and Mason, Confederate Commissioners to 
France and England, on board the Trent, by bodies of armed men from the United
 States' war-ship San Jacinto; and we now give, on the preceding page, an 
Engraving representing this violation of international law—which will be 
attended, it is to be feared, with the very gravest consequences. The purser
 of the mail-steamer Trent supplies the following narrative of the circumstances
 attending the boarding of that vessel by the Lieutenant and men of the American
 sloop-of-war San Jacinto and the seizure of the Confederate Commissioners:—</p>
<p>I hasten to forward some particulars of the grievous outrage committed today 
(Nov. 8) against the English flag by the United States' steam-sloop San Jacinto,
 Captain Wilks. You have probably heard how, some three weeks ago, the little 
steamer Theodora, having on board the commissioners sent by the Confederate 
States of America to London and Paris, ran the blockade at Charlston, arriving 
safely in Havannah. Once arrived there, they, of course, imagined that on neutral
 territory they were perfectly free and safe from all molestation, and therefore
 made no attempt to conceal their names, position, and intended movements. Mr. 
Slidell, the commissioner for Paris, was accompanied by his wife, son, and three
 daughters, and also by his secretary, Mr. G. Eustis, with his wife, Mr. Mason,
 the commissioner for England, being accompanied by his secretary, Mr. 
M'Farland. It was well known in Havannah that berths were booked for the whole
 party to proceed by this steamer to St. Thomas, there to join the homeward West
 India mail steam-ship for Southampton. They accordingly embarked yesterday 
morning, trusting to receive the same protection under the English flag which
 they had already received from that of Spain.</p>
<p>We left Havannah yesterday morning at eight. This morning, about half-past 
eleven, we observed a large steam-ship ahead, and on a nearer approach found
 she was hove to, evidently awaiting us. We were then in the narrowest part of
 the Bahama Channel, abreast of Paredon Grande Lighthouse. As soon as we were 
well within range we had the first intimation of her nationality and intentions
 by a round-shot being fired across our bows, and at the same moment by her 
showing American colours. We were now sufficiently near to observe that all her 
ports were open, guns run out, and crew at their stations. On a still nearer 
approach she fired a shell from a swivel-gun of large calibre on her forecastle,
 which passed within a few yards of the ship, bursting about a hundred yards to
 leeward. We were not within hail, when Captain Moir, commanding this ship, 
asked the American what he meant by stopping his ship, and why he did so by
 firing shotted guns, contrary to usual custom. The reply was that he wished 
to send a boat on board of us. This was immediately followed by a boat pushing 
off from the side of the San Jacinto, containing between twenty and thirty men,
 heavily armed, under the command of the First Lieutenant, who came up on the 
quarter-deck, and, after asking for Captain Moir, demanded a list of passengers.
 As his "right of search" was denied, the information required was, of course, 
peremptorily refused. He then stated that he had information that Messrs.
Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland were on board, and demanded that they 
should be given up. This also being indignantly refused, Mr. Slidell himself 
came forward and said that the four gentlemen named were then before him, but
 he appealed to the British flag, under which they were sailing, for protection.
 The Lieutenant said that his orders were to take them on board the San Jacinto
 by force if they would not surrender. He then walked to the side of the ship 
waved his hand: immediately three more heavily-armed boats pushed off and 
surrounded the ship, and the party of marines who come in first boat came up 
and took possession of the quarter-deck; these, however, he ordered down on 
the main-deck, to take charge of the gangway ports. Captain Williams, R.N., 
the naval agent in charge of the mails, who was of course present during this 
interview, then, in the name of her Majesty, he being the only person on board
 directly representing her, made a vehement protestation against this piratical
 act.</p>
<p>During the whole of this time the San Jacinto was about 200 yards distant 
from us on the port beam, her broadside guns, which were all manned, directly 
bearing upon us. Any open resistence to such a force was of course hopeless, 
although, from the loud and repeated plaudits which followed Captain Williams's
 protestations, and which were joined in by every one, without exception, of the
 passengers congregated on the quarter-deck, men of all nations, and from the 
manifested desire of some to resist to the last, I have no doubt but that every
 person would have joined heart and soul in the struggle had our commander but 
given the order. Such an order he could not, under such adverse circumstances, 
conscientiously give, and it was therefore considered sufficient that a party of
 marines, with bayonets fixed, should forcibly lay hands on the gentlemen named.
 This was done, and the gentlemen retired to their cabins to arrange some few 
changes of clothing. A most heartrending scene now took place between Mr. 
Slidell, his eldest daughter—a noble girl devoted to her father—and the
 Lieutenant. It would require a far more able pen than mine to describe how, 
with flashing eyes and quivering lips, she threw her[sic] herself in the doorway of 
the cabin where her father was, resolved to defend him with her life, till, on
 the order being given to the marines to advance, which they did, with bayonets
 pointed at this poor defenceless girl, her father ended the painful scene by 
escaping from the cabin by a window, when he was immediately seized by the 
marines and hurried into the boat, calling out to Captian Moir as he he left 
that he held him and his Government responsible for this outrage.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> attitude and bearing of the people of England 
under the circumstances which have arisen in connection with the seizure of the
 Confederate Commissioners on board the Trent have been in all respects worthy 
of the occasion. This is not the verdict of mere self-complacency, but ample 
testimony has been borne by the press of France to the mingled dignity, 
moderation, and firmness of purpose which have been displayed by the whole 
country, and without exception of class. The bitterest satirists on England 
and the English have failed to find anything in our conduct on which to base 
even a sneer; while for an accusation no shadow of a foundation has been 
discovered. If it were necessary we might quote some of the language of writers
 in Continental journals in which our national spirit, our unanimity of feeling,
 and our consciousness of being in the right are held up to admiration in no 
measured terms; but we only refer to these eulogies for the purpose of 
illustration, and with no desire to make more of a highly creditable state of 
things than it deserves. It would certainly have been a melancholy thing if a 
country like this should on the occurrence of an act of aggression have set 
about to scold and vapour with all the sound and fury of those, whether persons
 or nations, who are assured neither of their position nor the rights of the 
matter in dispute; and therefore, while admitting simply and unostentatiously
 the justice of any commendation which we have received for our conduct in this 
juncture of our national affairs, we can afford to be almost surprised that any 
one should have conceived it could have been other than it has been. It is to be
 observed that, as the time since the intelligence of the Jacinto affair was

received has run on, the public mind has taken a calmer view of the situation;
 but, nevertheless, there has not appeared any abatement of the resolute 
determination to hold to the honour of England at all hazards which was the 
first sensation that pervaded the land. If there be any change in the view of 
this question—and we think there is—it is a growing incredulity with regard to 
the necessity for a resort to the bloody arbitrement of the sword. Reflection, 
consideration, examination of the subject in all its bearings, seem to lead to
 something like a conviction that, if a similar process be applied to the 
question on the other side of the water, it must result in a peaceable issue. 
The most recent accounts show that some change has come over the spirit in
 which most of the Federal so-called organs of public opinions deal with this
 subject. The tone adopted by these journals is much more serious and practical
 than that which characterised the delivery of opinions on the first blush of 
the matter; and something has been done to familiarise the popular mind in 
America with the surrender of the Confederate Commissioners as a contingency by
 no means remote. Some of them go so far as to say that the recent event 
cannot—we suppose because it ought not—be a cause of war; and others have 
allowed that, if the act of the officers of the Federal navy is not justifiable
 by the law of nations, it cannot inflict any wound on the national honour to 
make a suitable apology. The signs of the existence of such a feeling, however
 feeble they may be, are not without significance, and from them may be  drawn
 auguries of things to come which, we believe, the most sensitive Englishmen 
would be willing enough to witness. It must be remembered that these indications
 of a tendency to
  <figure><graphic url="v39p591b.jpg" width="845px" height="554px" ana="#pic"/>

concession in America have taken place before there has been any knowledge of 
the manner in which the affair of the Trent has been received in England. Surely
 the august spectacle of a nation unanimous for the vindication of its honour, 
and consentaneous in its conviction that that honour has been wounded, cannot be
 without its effect even on a nation so impulsive as the Americans. It is with a
 full consciousness of all the disadvantages, present and prospective, to both 
countries which must follow a war such as that which we are obliged to 
contemplate, but ready at all points for even such a contingency, that England 
awaits the result of the intercommunication between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In the mean time, in a spirit of perfect candour, and divesting ourselves of
 any mere partisanship, it may be worth while to consider some of the 
disadvantages which this untoward act—for untoward it is from any point of 
view—is calculated to bring upon the cause for which the Northern States are 
contending. It is useless to blink the fact that the civil war has assumed a 
magnitude which probably we in Europe did not contemplate, and which has called
 forth at the very earliest period all the resources of the North. The visions 
of a rapid subjugation of the South in one triumphant campaign have faded before
 the stern reality of the situation; and, while it is broadly stated on all
 hands on this side of the water that a restoration of the old Union is assuming
 the aspect of an impossibility, it has been whispered that such an opinion has
 secretly taken root in the minds of the Cabinet at Washington, and that a 
contest with England is adopted as a policy out of which may spring a pretext 
for the ultimate acknowledgment of the independence of the South. If this is 
really the case, why, all ground for argument is cutaway, and it must be 
readily admitted that no course more calculated to attain that end could have
 been selected than that of bringing on a quarrel with this country.</p>
<p>But disregarding the insinuation that a policy so tortuous underlies the 
conduct of the advisers of Mr. Lincoln, and assuming that the object of the 
Federal Government is the rehabilitation of the Union, it is impossible not to 
see the instantaneous damage that would be done to that object if war with 
England comes to pass. Already we see in the message of Mr. Jefferson Davis 
indications of the effect which such a dispute would have on the fortunes of 
the party of which he is the head. His bold assertion of a violation of 
international law in the case of the Trent is pregnant with suggestion, and its 
interpretation is that he sees in that act a near prospect of the recognition of
 the Southern States as an independent Republic by one of the first Powers of 
Europe. Of the moral force of such a declaration on the cause of which he is the
 apostle there can be little doubt; but if the matter should come to positive 
hostilities a glance will suffice to show, in the first place, the whole 
Southern seaboard practically set free from blockade, the cotton trade in 
full operation, under the practical convoy of the fleets of England, with a 
corresponding financial effect on the resources of that part of the American 
continent; while, on the other hand, the ports of the North will be fast closed,
 and an equivalent check placed on the commerce and sources of strength and 
action of the Federal power. This is no idle boast or senseless assertion, for 
we have the ships, the guns, and, above all, at this juncture of our naval 
history, we are strong just where we have hitherto been weak; we have the men,
 the sailors, without whom all the, vessels of war in the world would be inert
 masses. Already there comes from the great emporiums of trade and commerce, 
from New York notably, the rumour of mercantile stagnation, and, worse still, 
the cry of popular distress. Civil war alone has sown the seeds of paralysis 
in that national prosperity of which Americans were so justly proud, and in the
 most fortunate future looms a large national debt and years of financial 
struggle. What may not be predicated as the result of a war with a powerful 
kingdom like England, added to the internecine strife which is now going on in
 the States? In the interests of humanity and of civilisation and progress one
 shrinks from the contemplation of the rebound of a quarter of a century of a 
nation which, always a world's wonder, possessed within it so many of the 
elements of advancement to greatness.</p>
<p>Nor, in considering the consequences of an unfriendly termination of the
 differences between England and the Federal States, can the probable conduct
 of other nations in Europe be placed out of sight. In the very first rank, of 
course, must be placed France; and, if the opinions of the Imperial Government 
be at all truly indicated, there is little doubt of the line which will be taken
 by that country. If the arguments of the French journals—even those which, as 
the phrase goes, are "inspired" from the highest quarters—mean anything, they 
mean that this question is not to be looked at from a merely English point of 
view at all. It is stated that it is only an accident that the Confederate 
Commissioners were seized under the British flag; for, supposing they had found 
it convenient to take passage in a French vessel, the officers of the San 
Jacinto would have felt themselves equally bound to have captured them under
 the tricolor. In fact, it is urged that the question is a purely international
 one, and one on which it is impossible but that the opinion of all the nations
 of Europe must be consentaneous. The <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> and 
its immediate vindication rest on England, but the moral force of international
 opinion will also be brought to bear on the quarrel, and that in direct 
opposition to the American side of the question. These considerations take the
 matter wholly out of the comparatively narrow bounds of a captious dispute
 between England and the Federal States. The question becomes cosmopolitan, and
 its bearings and its consequences assume adequate proportions.</p>
<p>If something of all this, which we have, owing to an earnest desire to enter 
on the discussion with the utmost moderation, perhaps too faintly indicated, 
could present itself to the American as it most surely does to the English mind,
 we might yet see a satifactory, because a peaceful, solution of this vexed
 question. England, resolute and prepared for any eventuality, but more in
 sorrow than in anger, demands reparation for an international as well as a 
national wrong. If she had any choice she would have preferred that any other
 State of Europe should have undertaken the vindication of a principle which 
she holds only in common with other nations. There are special reasons too 
obvious and too often dwelt upon which make a quarrel of this kind in the 
abstract distasteful to her. She does not forget "that blood is thicker than
 water," but she also remembers that the time has been when in a contest for 
high principles and rights she could bear to see conflict even between brother
 and brother on her own soil, and, grievous as was the sacrifice, it was a 
lustration from which she did not shrink. She wishes to shed no kinsman's blood
 now: let us hope that that feeling will prove to be reciprocal.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS, OF THE SAN JACINTO.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Captain Charles Wilks</hi>, the hero of the hour in the United States, 
was born in the State of New York in 1805, and entered the United States' Navy
 in 1818. In 1838 he was commissioned by the Federal Government, with the grade
 of Captain, to take command of a naval expedition to explore the countries 
bordering on the Pacific and Southern Oceans. Starting from New York, he 
doubled Cape Horn, visited the Sandwich, Feejee, and other Polynesian groups,
 and the coast of Oregon; crossed over to Australia and Tasmania, decending as
 low as the 61st degree of south latitude. He visited Singapore and Borneo, 
and returned to New York in 1842, by way of the Cape of Good Hope. Several 
courts-martial were held upon him, from which, however, he issued without loss
 of rank. The results of his expedition were recounted in a voluminous 
illustrated work entitled "A Narrative of the United States' Exploring 
Expedition." In 1848 the Geographical Society of London presented him with a 
gold medal as a token of their appreciation of his services to science. He has 
since published a work entitled "Western America," which contains statistical 
and geographical facts and maps relating to the States of the Pacific Coast. He
 was returning from the coast of Africa, in command of the San Jacinto, when, 
hearing at Havannah that the Confederate Coinmissioners intended to take passage
 in the steamer Trent, he determined to seize them and any despatches they might
 have with them. In acting as he did he states that he was guided only by his 
own notions of his duty to his country, and that he had no instructions from 
his superiors at Washington.</p>
 
<p rend="center">THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE CONFEDERATE<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps"> STATES.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">IN</hi> our Issue of this week we give Portraits of Mr.
 Mason and Mr. Slidell, the Commissioners of the Southern States of America, who 
were arrested by the officers of the San Jacinto on board the British mail-
steamer Trent.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. MASON.</p>
<p>This gentleman, the Commissioner to England, is a native of the State of 
Virginia, and is of direct English descent, this fact of lineage having been 
always held traditionally in his family. He is the grandson of George Mason, 
one of the most celebrated of the worthies of Virginia, who was the framer and 
chief supporter of the first Constitution of that State. The subject of our 
present memoir was born in the latter part of the last century, and made his 
first appearance in public life in 1823, as a member of a Convention of the 
Southern States which was assembled for the purpose of carrying our a favourite
 plan of Washington for opening up the resources of Virginia by means of a canal
 between the Ohio and the Chesapeake Rivers. In 1827 he was a member of a 
Convention under whose auspices the old Constitution of the State of Virginia
 was altered. In 1846 he was elected to the Senate of the United States, and 
was afterwards rechosen at every election almost without opposition. 
Immediately on his becoming a Senator he was appointed a member of that 
important section of the Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee, which 
position he held without interruption until his retirement from that body, 
and he was for more than ten years the chairman of that Committee. In 1850 
he took part in the discussion which ended in California being declared a Free 
State, and was one of the seven or eight members who, in conjunction with Mr. 
Jefferson Davis, was in favour of terminating the Convention of the Southern 
States with the Federal system by their withdrawal from the Union. In politics
 Mr. Mason has always been a consistent Democrat. He married the daughter of 
Mr. Benjamin Chew, a member of a family of some consideration in the State of 
Pennsylvania. Although not endowed with any remarkable energy or brilliancy, 
Mr. Mason has always shown capacity for affairs; while on his personal character
 as a gentleman of high honour and elevated sentiments no slur has ever been 
attempted to be cast.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SLIDELL.</p>
<p>Mr. Slidell, the Commissioner to France, was born in the city of New York, 
and the date of his birth also belongs to the last century. At a comparatively 
late period of life he commenced the study of the law, and, having formally 
embraced the legal profession, he removed to New Orleans, where he practised 
with great success and accumulated a large fortune by the exercise of  his 
ability and industry, which, combined with great energy of character, have 
always caused him to hold a prominent position in public life. He married the 
accomplished daughter of a gentleman of Louisiana, the lady who accompanied him
 in his voyage towards Europe was present at his capture on board the Trent, 
and is now residing in this country. Under the presidency of General Jackson he
 was appointed District Attorney for the State of Louisiana. He was subsequently
 elected to Congress for two terms, and served the first, but before the second
 had expired he was selected as the head of the mission to Mexico, and continued
 Minister for the United States in that country until war was declared. In 1853
 he was elected a member of the Senate of the United States, and occupied that
 position until the secession of the Southern States. It should be mentioned 
that when Mr. Buchanan became President he was desirous of obtaining the 
services of Mr. Slidell in his Cabinet, and placed any office which might suit 
his views at his disposal, but that offer was not accepted. Afterwards the 
acceptance of more than one foreign mission was pressed on Mr. Slidell, and 
especially the post of United States' Minister to France, but these distinctions
 he also declined.</p>

<p>The Europa, which took out the instructions to Lord Lyons on the subject of
 the Trent steamer, left Queenstown on the 1st inst. for Halifax; and the 
Federal Government most probably knew the nature of those instructions on 
Wednesday or Thursday. The following are the steamers which will bring 
important news from America subsequently to the receipt of the instructions 
in Washington, viz.—The Canada will leave Boston on the 11th, will call off Cape 
Race for news on the 13th, and reach Queenstown on the 22nd. The North American 
will leave Portland on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 15th, and reach 
Londonderry on the 23rd. The City of Baltimore will leave New York on the 14th, 
call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach Queenstown on the 24th. The Bavaria 
will leave New York on the 14th, call off Cape Race on the 16th, and reach 
Cowes on the 26th. The Africa will leave New York on the 18th, call off Cape 
Race on the 20th, and reach Queenstown on the 30th.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the screw-steamer Etna we have received New York journals 
of the 30th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OUTRAGE ON THE TRENT.</p>

<p>The journals of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, as a general rule, speak 
much more hesitatingly of the legality of Captain Wilks's act than they did a
 week previously. They condescend to contemplate the possibility of reclamations
 on the part of Great Britain, and of yielding thereto. The <hi rend="italic">
Tribune</hi> says:—"If the British Government can be induced for the sake of 
reclaiming them" (Messrs. Mason and Slidell) "to take the highest American 
ground in favour of neutral maritime rights, we shall have sold them for a 
great deal more than they are worth." The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> 
acknowledges that the Northerners have hitherto been unjust to the British
 Government in complaining that it recognised the South as a belligerent Power. 
The President must soon take the same position.</p>

<p>It has transpired that no dispatches have been found in the trunks of the 
Ambassadors. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> remarks upon this 
unwelcome discovery :—"In that case the <hi rend="italic">letter</hi> of much 
of the reasoning employed in justification of the act of Captain Wilks may 
become nugatory."</p>

<p>The lawyers have begun to suspect that the Laurens and other cases have been
 misrepresented by Messrs. George Sumner and Everett, while the moneyed men 
still refuse to accept the assurances of the journals that it was "all right." 
It was feared, however, that the news of the burning of the Harvey Birch by the

 Nashville would again inflame the minds of the people against England.</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILKS' RECEPTION IN BOSTON.</p>
<p>The Bostonians, usually so much more friendly than the New Yorkers, have on 
this occasion not acted in a manner worthy of their well-earned reputation. A 
public banquet at the Revere House was got up for the hero of the hour, and 
nothing could exceed the bad taste of the Massachusetts speakers (among whom 
were Judges Bigelow and Russell, Governor Andrew, and Mayor Rice), whether 
their insolent bombast was levelled at their two unfortunate captives or at 
the Government and people of a friendly nation.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>The Federals had taken possession of the island of Tybee, at the mouth of 
the Savannah River. The people of that city were flying panicstruck into the 
interior. The Confederates had blocked up the inlet leading to Savannah.</p>

<p>The Federals at Hilton Island found the place vary unhealthy, and were 
suffering much from fever and ague and congestive fever. All the teamsters and 
camp-followers were leaving for the North. The Federals have also occupied a 
post on St. Helena Sound, fifteen miles north of Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 19th ult. Colonel Brown opened fire from Fort Pickens on Pensacola, 
Florida. On the 24th the fight was still going on, we know not certainly with 
what result. The Southerners admit that the Navy-yard was destroyed, with all 
its stores; that Pensacola had been evacuated; and that General Bragg had 
called for reinforcements. On the other hand, they claim to have driven off
 five vessels of war, to have riddled the Niagara with balls, and thoroughly
 disabled the Colorado. This is the Southern account; it will probably be 
another week before the Northern report reaches us.</p>

<p>The armies of the Potomac and the Upper Potomac were engaged in hutting 
themselves. It is still, however, strenuously denied that they are going into 
winter quarters.</p>

<p>The largest body of men ever reviewed on the American continent was passed 
in review by General M'Clellan, at Washington, on the 20th of November. The 
troops consisted of seventy-six regiments of infantry, seven of cavalry, and 
seventeen batteries, in all about 70,000 men.</p>

<p>Commerce in Missouri below St. Louis will be conducted by the Federal 
Government only.</p>

<p>The Fingal had run into Charleston with her valuable and timely cargo. On 
the other hand, the Federal ships have captured several vessels laden with 
contraband of war.</p>

<p rend="center">THE POLICY OF EMANCIPATION.</p>

<p>On this question Secretary Smith, a member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has 
expressed himself to the effect that the views of Mr. Cameron were not those of 
the Administration.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Congress had passed a resolution for removing the seat of Government from 
Richmond to Nashville, Tennessee. Perhaps one reason for this step is the 
destruction of the costly bridges on the Virginia and Tenneessee Railroad, which
 imperils the connection between Richmond and the South-western States.</p>

<p>The Union men of North Carolina formally established a provisional State 
Government at Hatteras inlet on the 18th ult.</p>

<p>A portion of the people of Kentucky and Missouri have passed Secessionn 
ordinances.</p>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT DAVIS'S MESSAGE.</p>

<p>President Davis congratulates Congress on the progress of domestic 
manufactures among them. He speaks moderately of the great deeds of the 
Confederate army and of the high spirit of patriotism with which they are 
animated. He says:—</p>
<q>A succession of glorious victories at Bethel, Bull Run, Manassas, 
Springfield Lexington, Leesburg, and Belmont, has checked the wicked invasion 
which greed of gain and the unhallowed lust of power brought upon our soil, and
 has proved that numbers cease to avail when directed against a people fighting
 for the sacred right of self-government and the privileges of freemen. After 
seven months of war the enemy have not only failed to extend their occupancy of
 our soil, but new States and territories have been added to our confederacy; 
while, instead of their threatened march of unchecked conquest, they have been
 driven at more than one point to assume the defensive, and, upon a fair 
comparison between the two belligerents as to men, military means, and fiancial
 condition the Confederate States are relatively much stronger now than when 
the struggle commenced.</q>

<p>After referring to the occurrences in Kentucky and Missouri, and, 
acknowleging that the postal service was entirely disarranged, he puts as good
 a face as possible on the condition of the Confederate treasury, which, 
however, is evidently driven to the extremity of issuing baseless promises to
 pay. By constructing forty miles of railroad between Danville in Virginia, and
 Queensborough, in North Carolina, a third through line of communication could 
be opened from North to South. He urgently advises Congress to give aid to the 
company organised for its construction and administration. He scoffs at the very
 idea of reconstructing the Union. "Our people now look with contemptuous 
astonishment on those with whom they have been so recently associated. They 
shrink with aversion from the bare idea of renewing such a connection:"—</p>
<q>When they see a President making war without the assent
 of Congress—when they behold Judges threatened because they maintain the writ 
of habeas corpus, so sacred to freemen—when they see justice and law trampled 
under the armed heel of military authority, and upright men insist and innocent
 women dragged to distant dungeons-when they find all this tolerated and
 applauded by a people who have been in the full enjoyment of freedom but a few 
mouths ago, they believe that there must be some radical incompatibility 
between such a people and themselves. With such a people we may be content to 
live at peace, but the separation is final, and for the independence we have 
asserted we will accept no alternative.</q>

<p>After denouncing the barbarous manner in which the United States have 
conducted the war, he accuses them of desiring to excite a servile war by the 
invasion of South Carolina, and warns them that in such a war they would forfeit
 all claims to be considered as prisoners of war. Of the seizure of Messrs. 
Mason and Slidell he says.—</p>

<q><p>The United States have thus claimed a general jurisdiction over the high 
seas, and, entering a British ship, sailing under its country's flag, violated 
the rights of embassy, for the most part held sacred, even among 
barbarians, by seizing our Ministers whilst under the protection and within the

 dominions of a neutral nation.</p>
<p>These gentlemen were as much under the jurisdiction of the British 
Government upon that ship and beneath that flag as if they had been on its 
soil, and a claim  on the part of the United States to seize them in the streets
 of London would have been as well founded as that to apprehend them where they
 were taken. Had they been malefactors, and citizens even of the United States,
 they could not have been arrested on a British ship or on British soil unless 
under the express provisions of a treaty and according to the forms therein 
provided for the extradition of criminals. But rights the most sacred seem to 
have lost all respect in their eyes.</p></q>

<p>The close of Mr. Davis's Message is evidently levelled rather at Great 
Britain and France than at the body he professes to be addressing. On the 
subjects of the blockade and the growth of cotton he says:—</p>

<q><p>Perhaps we had the right, if see had chosen to 
exercise it, to ask to know whether the principle, that blockades to be binding
 must be effectual, solemnly announced by the great Powers of Europe at Paris, 
is to be generally enforced or applied only to particular cases.</p>

<p>When the Confederate States, at your last session, became a party to the 
declaration reaffirming this principle of international law, which has been
 recognised so long by publicists and Governments, we certainly supposed it was 
to be universally enforced. The customary law of nations is made up of their 
practice rather than their declarations, and if such declarations are only to
 be enforced in particular instances at the pleasure of those who make them, 
then the commerce of this world, so far from being placed under a general law,
 will become subject to the caprise of those who execute it or suspend it at 
will. If such is to be the course of nations in regard to this law, it is plain
 that it will thus become a rule for the weak and not for the strong.</p>

<p>Feeling that such views must be taken by the neutral nations of the earth, I 
have caused the evidence to be collected which proves completely the utter 
inefficiency of the proclaimed blockade of our coast, and shall direct it to be 
laid before such Governments as shall afford us the means of being heard.</p>

<p>But, although we should be benefitted by the enforcement of this law, so 
solemnly declared by the great Powers of Europe, we are not dependent on that 
enforcement for the successful prosecution of the war. As long as hostilities 
continue the Confederate States will exhibit a steadily increasing capacity to 
furnish their troops with food, clothing, and arms. If they should be forced to 
forego many of the luxuries and some of the comforts of life, they will at 
least have the consolation of knowing that they are thus daily becoming more 
and more independent of the rest of the world. If, in this process, labour in 
the Confederate States should be gradually diverted from those great Southern 
staples which have given life to so much of the commerce of mankind into other 
channels, so as to make them rival producers instead of profitable customers, 
they will not be the only or even the chief losers by this change in the
 direction of their industry.</p>

<p>Although it is true that the cotton supply from the Southern states could 
only be totally cut off by the subversion of our social system, yet it is plain 
that a long continuance of this blockade might, by a diversion of labour and 
investment of capital in other employments, so diminish the supply as to bring
 ruin upon all those interests of foreign countries which are dependent on that staple.</p>

<p>For every labourer who is diverted from the culture of cotton in the South,
 perhaps four times the number elsewhere, who found subsistence in the
 various employments growing out of its use, will be forced also to change
 their occupations.</p>

<p>While the war which is waged to take from us the right of self-government 
can never attain that end, it remains to be seen how far it may work a 
revolution in the industrial system of the world, which may carry suffering to
 other lands as well as to our own.</p></q>

<p>Since the Canadian line of European Steamers have begun to start from the 
United States' port of Portland the passport system, inaugurated by Mr. Seward,
 is very troublesome to Canadian travellers. As no one but the Secretary of 
State is authorised to issue passports, much delay ensues, and many travellers
 have been forced to remain over for a week with or without their baggage. This 
conduct on the part of Mr. Seward causes much heartburning among the people who 
dwell on the north bank of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Lord Monck was sworn in as Governor-General of Canada on the 28th ult.</p>

<p>The war in America has hitherto brought many advantages to the industrial
 interests of Canada. For the first time in history the St. Lawrence route has
 enjoyed a considerable share of the export trade of the Western States. As a
 consequence, Montreal has risen to be the second American seaport in the grain
 and provision business. The canal-boats, warehouses, and elevators on the St. 
Lawrence line are unable to transact the business which has so suddenly poured 
in upon them. Canadian imports from Europe have increased, while those of the 
United States have fallen off more than fifty per cent. The number of immigrants from Europe have increased from 9654 last year to 19,461 this year. The 
increase of immigrants from both Northern and Sontherns States is in still 
larger proportion. These American immigrants have established in Canada many 
small manufactories. Probably, at least 50,000 souls have been added to the
 population of the province by immigration in 1861.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> latest intelligence from the United States, 
although not quite so unsatisfactory as that previously received, still leaves 
strong grounds for apprehension. There is no disguising the fact that most of 
the leading journals, and public opinion in that country generally, are against
 yielding to any demands that may be made by her Majesty's Government to restore
 the citizens of the Confederate States recently taken by force from the deck of
 a West India mail-packet carrying the English flag. Looking, at the same time,
 to the opinion and temper of the English people upon this subject, we see such
 sufficient cause for alarm that our attention is immediately drawn towards the
 position of the British colonies in North America, and particularly to the 
boundary line tha[t] separates them from the United States.</p>

<p>It would be useless now to discuss the question as to how the frontier line
 of Canada and New Brunswick has become what it is, or whether it might not 
have been, by more judicious management, better than we now find it; but it is 
certain that the boundary line of the States of Maine and New York does so cut 
into the British territory that United States' armies may encamp within 
exceedingly short distance of our principal cities and yet be on their own soil.
</p>

<p>Newfoundland being an island, and Nova Scotia nearly one, we may safely 
calculate on our naval supremacy ensuring them protection from molestation; but
 with the important province of New Brunswick, the Canadas, and the British 
North-west Territory, our position is by no means so satisfactory, as in many
 instances in these latter provinces there is no physical boundary whatever, 
the British possessions and those of the United States being separated by little
 more than an imaginary line. The trees have been cut down where it passes 
through the wilderness, and a few stones have been set up at long distances
 apart, and that is the only division that marks the territories of two peoples
 who, though coming of a common stock, speaking the same language, and 
worshipping God in the same manner, yet are intent only on doing each other the 
largest possible amount of mischief. There is yet hope that it may not be so, 
but the threatening aspect of affairs compels us to look narrowly at our 
position on the frontier.</p>

<p>The city of Quebec, our great stronghold in North America, is only sixty
 miles from the United States' territory; and River de Loup, the eastern 
terminus of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, and of the Canadian sytem of 
railways generally, although 120 miles lower down the St. Lawrence, is within 
thirty miles of the international boundary line.</p>

<p>Montreal, the capital of the Canadas, is only forty-four miles by railway 
from Rouse's Point at the head of Lake Champlain—a point where the States of New
 York and Vermont meet. Several of the United States' railways focus to this
 place, and it will become an important position should war break out: it was so
 in 1814, a great battle being fought in this neighbourhood, the victory being 
claimed by the Americans.</p>

<p>From Rouse's Point for neary 300 miles eastward are what are called the 
eastern townships of Canada—districts containing many important towns and much 
cleared and cultivated land; these abut upon the States of Vermont, New 
Hampshire, and Maine, without any marked physical boundary, the St. Lawrence 
lying on their northern or western edge. West of Montreal, nearly opposite the 
Canadian town of Cornwall, the boundary line of the United States hits the St. 
Lawrence, and the river 
then separates them from Canada until it receives its waters at the outlet from
 Lake Ontario, many good towns lying on each side of it. On the Canadian banks 
the principal are Cornwall, Morrisburg, Prescott, and Kingston; on the United 
States' side the principle town is Ogdenburg, exactly opposite Prescott.  These
 latter are large and important places, situated pretty much as Gravesend and 
Tilbury Fort are; both are important railway termini. Prescott is the point of
 junction of the Grand Trunk Railway with the line to Ottawa, the intended seat
 of the Government of Canada; while Ogdensburg is connected by railway with
 Rouse's Point to the eastward and with the New York Central Railway to the
 southward and westward. Kingston, in Canada, is situated at the point where
 Lake Ontario pours its waters into the St. Lawrence through a thousand 
channels formed by a number of beautiful islands. Kingston is a fortified 
place, and adjoins Fort Henry, a military position second only in importance 
to Quebec. Fort Henry is built on the site of the old French Fort Frontenac. 
In a war with the United States this place would become most important as a 
dápôt for troops, as well as a naval station, where craft would be
 built to act upon Lake Ontario and the upper waters of the St. Lawrence. On the
 north shore of Lake Ontario is situated the large, rich, and flourishing city 
of Toronto, the capital of Western Canada. It is built close upon the waters 
edge, is utterly unprotected by art, but nature his done much for it. It is a 
peculiar characteristic of Lake Ontario to have formed in particular situations
 long banks of sand and shingle, locally called beaches. At a considerable 
distance from the shore, in front of the city, is a long narrow bank of this 
description, upon which batteries could be formed with rapidity, that would 
effectually protect this important city from all attacks on the lake side, while
 direct railway communication with Fort Henry would secure it landwards. Toronto
, therefore, though apparently so exposed, may be safely expected to take care 
of itself when the time arrives for its doing so. At the western end of Lake 
Ontario is situated another large and important city, Hamilton, and protected 
from all attacks from the lake by a beach similar to that which lies in front 
of Toronto. A single vessel sunk in the canal which connects the waters of 
Burlington Bay (on the south shore of which Hamilton is situated) with those of 
Lake Ontario renders it impossible for any vessel to approach within three or
 four miles of Hamilton. Its dangers, therefore, must be sought for in the 
oppsitosite direction.</p>

<p>On the south shore of Lake Ontario there are situated several important 
United States' towns; and between the mouth of the Niagara River and the point
 where the lake becomes the River St. Lawrence are no lees than six railway 
termini to lines which are connected with the New York central line. In the 
Genesee, at Oswego, and Sackett's harbour, in the event of hostilities, 
armaments would be fitted out to operate upon the opposite shore, in which case
 Lake Ontario would again become the scene of remarkable naval exploits. Across
 the lake, nearly opposite to Toronto, and within sight of it on a fine day,
 upon a high hill, stands the monument recently erected to General Brock, who
 fell there, after having gained a victory over the American troops.</p>

<p>The international boundary line, having passed up the centre of Lake Ontario
 to opposite this point, turns suddenly inwards and then follows, the centre of 
the deep river which enters the lake here, pouring out in one unbroken mass the
 accumulated surplus waters of the great Lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and 
Superior, white and foamy after the great leap they have made at Niagara, only
 a few miles higher up the stream. The Niagara River is a secure barrier for
 either nation. It may be crossed at its mouth, it is true, but not with 
impunity if an enemy occupied the precipitous hills on either side. At the foot 
of the Great Falls it may also be crossed, but a thousand men having done so
 could not land if fifty occupying the heights chose to prevent them. A
 magnificent bridge spans the terrible rush of waters down the gorge of the 
Niagara—a triumph of engineering skill which the arts of peace have produced,
 and which, doubtless, the art of war will destroy.</p>

<p>Above the Falls of Niagara the boundary line keeps the centre of the stream 
until it enters Lake Erie. The north shore of this lake is British, and contains
 some of the best districts of Western Canada. On the American side is the large
 city of Buffalo; also, Dunkirk, Erie, Cleveland, and Sandusky, the whole of 
which are railway termini.</p>

<p>The international boundary line is up the centre of Lake Erie and through 
the River St. Clair and Lake St. Clair into Lake Huron. Between Lakes Huron and
 Erie the United States and British territory is divided only by a fine 
navigable river, much like the Thames at Erith; the large American city of 
Detroit is situated on its west bank and the Canadian town of Windsor opposite 
to it. The latter is the western terminus of the Great Western Railway of
 Canada; the former the focus of a system of railways. From the upper end of
 the River St. Clair, the boundary line divides equally the waters of Lake 
Huron, and enters Lake Superior through the St. Marie. The larger portion of 
this lake belongs to the Americans. From its northern shore the line follows 
the direction of the water communications until it reaches the parallel of 
49° north latitude, along which it is continued across the Rocky Mountains 
until it reaches the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>On the north side of the forty-ninth parallel of latitude, adjoining the 
State of Minnesota, there exists a very valuable country known as the North-west
 Territory. Although in the occupation of the Hudson Bay Company, it is a tract 
of exceedingly fine land, and contains some settlements known as the Red River 
or Selkirk settlements. This is a far-off, outlying property of the British 
Crown, exceedingly valuable to us, and much coveted by the United States, it 
has been sadly neglected by its owners, and we may soon find it the most 
difficult to protect.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Although</hi> a certain and computed time must elapse
 before the answer from America shall determine whether bells or cannon will be
 the fittest ushers to announce the New Year, it is impossible to obtain much 
serious attention for any other subject. The candidate addressing the crowd, 
the senator giving in his accounts to his constituents, even the ex-Minister 
casually complimenting volunteers, at once fix on the American difficulty and 
submit their hopes or their solutions. Meantime journalists can but speculate 
and express the united feeling of the nation that we must uphold the honour of 
the English flag, but that we trust the good sense of the respectable classes 
in America will dominate over the passionate mob and spare us the terrible 
necessity of striking a blow. From the French papers we cull little save the 
expression of French opinion upon the outrage for which we have demanded redress,
 and it is satisfactory to see that the logical minds of the Parisian 
journalists, when permitted fair play, at once lead them to the conclusion that
 England had but one course open to her. Deeply interesting as would be at any
 other time the debates in the Italian Parliament and the situation of Baron 
Ricasoli and his Ministry, the fiery elegance or languid pedantry of the 
speakers is little heeded, nor can much indignation be spared for the atrocious
 cruelties which, if accounts be true, are being perpetrated upon the 
unfortunate Poles, in punishment for their recent demonstrations of love of
 country. All this negligence of all but one subject should be noted across the
 Atlantic, for it is a grim proof how thoroughly England—once aroused—shows 
herself in earnest.</p>

<p rend="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>In consequence of the possibility of a rupture between this country and the
 Federal States of North America the war authorities have exerted themselves 
with extraordinary vigour to send reinforcements promptly to Canada. The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> tells us that by to-day (Saturday) 2200 additional 
troops will be on their way to Canada. This will bring up the strength of the 
regular forces in the colony to between 7000 and 8000, and we have at home a 
reserve which, if the necessity should be forced upon us, would enable up[sic] to 
bring 30,000 highly disciplined men at once into the field. At all the dockyards
 the greatest activity prevails in getting ships of war ready for sea—the number
 destined for service on the West India and North American station being roughly
 estimated at about sixty.</p>

<p>Yesterday week the officers, non-commissioned officers, gunners, and drivers,
 comprising Captain Vesey's E battery of the 4th brigade Royal Field Artillery, 
assembled on parade at Woolwich, and after inspection proceeded in marching
 order from the garrison to the Royal Arsenal, for embarkation on board the 
screw steam-vessel Melbourne, for Canada. The streets in the line of march were 
crowded with spectators, and the force, which was preceded by the full band of 
the regiment and numerous field officers, was repeatedly cheered by the public, 
and especially on entering the main gate of the Royal Arsenal, where a multitude
 had assembled. The force immediately embarked from the Royal Arsenal jetty on 
board the Melbourne, which has shipped during the week the following amount of 
war stores—viz., two complete batteries of Armstrong guns, several howitzers, 
30,000 stand of arms and accoutrements, 2,500,000 rounds of Minié rifle
 balls and smallarms ammunition, 1500 rounds of Armstrong-gun ammunition,
 cartridges, &amp;c. She also takes out military clothing and a quantity of stores 
peculiarly adapted for Canada, including a number of snow-sleighs, which the 
wheelers and carpenters of the Royal carriage department were working day and
 night to manufacture during the week. The Melbourne was under orders to sail 
in the evening, but an order was received to increase by a large number the 
supply of sleighs for the transport of guns, &amp;c., and an additional number of 
workmen were consequently employed during the night. The embarkation scene is 
depicted on p 607.... The Melbourne sailed on Saturday at half-past two 
p.m. The long and spacious platform of the Royal Arsenal Pier was thronged 
during the process of getting under way by officers of the garrison and their 
families. As soon as the ship had veered round from her moorings and was fairly 
on her course the spectators gave a hearty "God speed!" which was immediately 
followed by the waving of caps and handkerchiefs and shouts of applause. The 
shouts then commenced on board, and were repeatedly heard when the Melbourne 
was far down the Thames, testifying in a perfectly unmistakable manner to the 
feelings of the troops. Besides the ordinary warm clothing which was sent out 
in the Melbourne, each man will be provided with the following articles:—A fur 
(sealskin) cap, two flannel waistcoats, a pair of fur gloves, six pair of Canada
 boots, two pair of woollen stockings, a comforter, and a chamois leather 
jacket. Some 3000 moccasins and snowshoes will also be sent as soon as they
 can be procured. The 30,000 Enfield rifles conveyed by the Melbourne are 
intended for the Canadian militia. This excellent force, numbering now some 
30,000, and capable of being increased to 200,000, was organised during the 
Crimean War. The volunteer movement has also taken deep root in Canada, and, as
 almost every village contains an old military officer, their drilling and 
organisation have been well looked after.</p>

<p>Other ships will speedily follow the Melbourne with similar freights. In 
addition to the Persia and Australasian, each of which will take out about 
1200 men, the Government have decided upon chartering six large steamers for 
the purpose of carrying troops and stores to Jamaica, Bermuda, and Halifax. The
 Persia and Australasian are being rapidly fitted for the conveyance of troops,
 stores, and ammunition, and it is expected they will be ready to sail about the
 14th or 15th inst. Each of them is to carry out a complement of 1100 soldiers, 
5000 stand of arms, and 300 tons of stores. Besides these each is to take out a
 field battery and a large quantity of ammunition.</p>

<p>It has been determined to send out a considerable number of non-commissioned
 officers to assist in the organisation of the Canadian militia—each regiment at
 Aldershott having been called to furnish three volunteers for this duty. It is 
stated that in some regiments as many as thirty sergeants have volunteered.</p>

<p>Colonel Napier, Deputy Quartermaster-General in Canada, is placed on the 
Staff in that colony, with the rank of Major-General. He is succeeded as 
Deputy Quartermaster-Genera1 by Colonel Mackenzie, C.B., who was on the China 
Staff. Colonel Lysons will be the Adjutant-General of Militia for the colony.</p>

<p>On Sunday week a large number of mechanics and labourers were employed at 
the Tower of London in packing firearms and every kind of article which is 
required for active service. Another order was received on Saturday last to 
prepare 25,000 more rifles, which were duly packed and conveyed in barges to 
the Government dépôt at Woolwich, where they were placed on board 
the several vessels which are about to depart for Canada. The large gunmakers 
at the east end of London are working night and day to execute large numbers 
of rifles, and each contractor has to supply a certain number daily, which are 
tested at the proofhouse and then sent to the Tower for exportation.</p>

<p>On Monday the first battalion of the Grenadier Guards were inspected at the 
Tower previous to their embarkation for Canada. The whole of the men have 
undergone medical examination, and those found unfit for active service have 
been rejected.</p>

<p>By order of the Lords of the Admiralty, Commodore Nicolson, of H.M.S.
 Fisgard, the guardship for the port of London, has issued notice that all 
members of the Royal Navy temporarily borne on the books of the Fisgard from 
ships that have been paid off, and who have been granted one month's leave of 
absence, are to rejoin immediately. Similar orders have been sent to all the 
outports, and all leave of absence is for the present suspended in the Royal 
Navy. The entry of able and ordinary seamen for her Majesty's service is being 
vigorously prosecuted, and the Royal Naval Rendezvous, Towerhill, which has 
been closed for some months, is to be reopened to receive men desirous of 
joining the service. From the returns recently made by Captain Brown, principal 
registrar of the Reserve of Naval Volunteers, it appears that the total 
strength of the corps is 7646 men. 180 of the number holding certificates of
 competency as masters and mates, and 1050 being competent to act as petty 
officers—all of whom are ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The total number of men available in our naval reserve is estimated by the 
<hi rend="italic">United Service Gazette</hi> at 21,231. The following is a 
detail of the several reserves on the lst instant:—Coastguard on ships' books 
for shore duty, 232 officers, 3386 men—3618. Ships' crews, 227 officers, 1763
 men, and 719 boys—2709. Tenders' crews, 107 officers, 574 men, and 166 boys—
847; marines, 510. Total, 7174. Old reserve force: 26 officers, 1108 men. 
Naval coast volunteers, 7768. Naval reserve force, 7440.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at various military stations in Ireland for 
completing the strength of sixty-nine regiments of the Line. Recruiting for 
that purpose will commence immediately.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> says that we could 
quadruple the force now and about to be under Admiral Milne, on the North 
American station, without any apparent effort. We could, besides heavy line-of-
battle ships, frigates, corvettes, sloops, and gun-vessels, spread over the 
seaboard of the Northern States no less than fifty screw gun-boats, each armed 
with heavy Armstrongs (they are all ready), to be followed by another hatch of 
fifty, if the first required support. The total force which we could place under
 Sir Alexander's orders wherewith he could open the ball would be, supposing the
 Mediterranean fleet furnished its quota, eleven line-of-battle ships, mounting 
975 guns, manned by 9580 men; ten frigates, mounting 447 guns, manned by 5150 
men; five heavy corvettes, mounting 105 guns, manned by 1360 men; and seventeen 
sloops and smaller vessels, mounting together 93 guns, manned by 1493 men; 
making a grand total of 1527 guns, and 12,436 men. In addition to the men now 
mentioned, the Donegal, Conqueror, and Sanspareil have on board a battalion of
 marines in the highest state of discipline.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Globe</hi> of Wednesday has a brief leader to the 
following effect:—Various statements, all more or 1ess inaccurate, having been 
made respecting the reinforcements for the protection of our interests in North
 America, it may be well to mention the steps actually taken for that purpose. 
The following troops have been ordered to Canada in the Persia, the Australasian,
 and the Melbourne, of which the Melbourne has sailed:—Two battalions of 
infantry of the Line, two batteries of Field Artillery, one company of Royal 
Engineers. And we understand that arrangements are being made for forwarding to 
British North America at once two battalions of Guards, four battalions of 
infantry of the Line, three batteries of Field Artillery, five batteries of 
Garrison Artillery, two battalions of Military Train, and two companies of 
Royal Engineers. The two battalions of the Guards under orders are the first 
battalion of the Grenadier Guards, now at the Tower, and the second battalion
 Scots Fusilier Guards, at Wellington Barracks. The Rifle Brigade and first 
battalion of the l6th are in course of embarkation, and the following battalions
 are held in readiness—viz., the first of the 15th, 96th, and second of the 
16th Regiments.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> page 611 we give an Illustration of a torchlight
 procession at Washington by Blenker's Brigade to celebrate M'Clellan's 
promotion to the command of the Federal Army. The central figure on horseback 
is General Blenker. The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> gives the 
following account of the Blenker procession:—"Three thousand Germans of General
 Blenker's division constituted a torchlight procession on Monday evening, 
November 11, and, with regimental bands and fireworks and coloured lights, 
marched to General M'Clellan's house to celebrate his promotion. Transparencies
 and pyrotechnic pieces of the most beautiful designs were added to the 
attraction. All Washington was out to see. The crowds soon demanded the 
American stimulus of a speech, and the calls for Secretaries Cameron and Seward 
brought them to the balcony. They briefly addressed the crowd. Calls were then 
made for General Blenker, who said :—'Citizens and Sojers,—I will say a few 
words, and it shall be few. If ever I find the enemy I will fight tousands, and 
tousands of us will fight better as I speak this noble English' (Immense 
cheering). Cries were made continually for General M'Clellan, but he merely 
appeared at different times upon the balcony, and bowed to the crowd of soldiers
 and civilians that filled the street from one side to the other. Within his 
house the General extemporised a generous collation, and gave a warm welcome to 
the officers who swarmed in to take him by the hand. The whole testimonial was 
a splendid success, and is due entirely to the spirit and liberality of General
 Blenker and his staff."</p>

<p>The special correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> at Washington
 writes as follows respecting this demonstration:—"The prettiest sight I have 
seen since I crossed the Atlantic was the torchlight procession got up by 
General Blenker and his Germans in honour of Major-General M'Clellan on his 
promotion to the command of the Army. It was something like a Burschen 
procession, but it exceeded very much any displays of the kind in the number of 
torchbearers and the variety of colour and effect. The camp of the Blenker 
men—famous for lager beer and quaint pipes, also for perverted notions respecting
 the <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> of Unionists and the <hi rend="italic">tuum</hi>
 of Secessionists—lies some miles across the Potomac, in the valleys and dells of
 the 'old dominion,' which is nearly as old as Canada,and is meeting with very 
rude treatment in its primitive antiquity. From it they came in a grand 
procession, with bands playing and rough chorus-singing, and filed over the 
Long-bridge in a dancing stream of fire—blue, green, red, yellow, orange, and 
dazzling white. The air was still, the night fine, and nothing could have been 
more successful than the fireworks in their way, or the impression produced by 
the stream crested with fire, which first glowed like a torrent of lava, then 
gradually broke its particles into a broad ribbon of nebulous flames, which, 
coming nearer, was resolved into balls of diverse-coloured light, and, thus 
winding on, thinned away into a narrow stripe of orange-like molten iron 
running through the black courses of the mould. The 'Dutchmen' pursued 
their career by Pennsylvania-avenue, past the State Department, and, turning 
in at the gates of the White House, treated the President to a sight of the 
demonstration intended for his benefit."</p>

<p>The Episcopal Church at Fairfax Court house, in Virginia, has been detroyed 
by the Confederate and Federal troops. The church was one of the oldest in the 
United States. It was built by Lord Fairfax, and the pulpit and altar were 
constructed in England. It was in this church and at this altar that George 
Washington was married.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> the retirement of General Scott, on the 31st of
 last October, General M'Clellan was formally declared Commander-in-Chief of the
 Federal forces, of which he had been for some time the actual head. George 
M'Clellan was born at Philadelphia in December, 1826, and destined for the 
military service. In his sixteenth year he was sent to West Point, and left it
 in 1846, as Second Lieutenant in the Engineers, to take part in the Mexican
 War. His bravery in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco gained him 
promotion, and at the storming of the forts of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec 
his conduct was so brilliant that it gained him his captaincy. After the peace
 he was appointed a teacher at West Point, where he wrote a manual of the art 
of war, which is highly esteemed by American soldiers. After this he built Fort 
Delaware, and then was ordered to Texas and New Mexico to make a topographic 
survey of the district through which the Pacific Railway was to run. This 
difficult task was interrupted by a summons to Washington, where the military 
department had selected him, in conjunction with Major Mordecai and Captain
 Delafield, to go and witness the operations in the Crimea, which excited as 
great interest in America as they did in Europe. As there was no prospect of 
active service on his return home, M'Clellan determined to leave the army, 
and accepted the post of technical director to the Illinois Central Railway, 
which he held for several years with credit. In this position the outbreak of 
the civil war surprised him, and, as he was universally respected and known in 
the West, he was at once called to a high post. The Governor of Ohio appointed 
him Major-General and chief of the militia of that State ; but by the 
recommendation of General Scott he was made Major-General of the regular Army, 
and intrusted with a most important command in Western Virginia. After the 
defeat of the Federal army at Bull Run, M'Clellan was summoned to Washington to 
take supreme command. A Washington letter describes the enthusiasm felt by his 
men for General M'Clellan:—"General M'Clellan (it states) is one of the least 
pretentious of men; he generally wears the simple blouse of the rifleman, with
 not even the starred shoulder-straps to denote his rank; a man who never wastes
 time—who is indefatigable in his pursuit and attack of the enemy, and equally 
untiring in his efforts to secure the utmost comfort of his men compatible with 
the circumstances of a soldier's life. When his line is on the march he is ever 
among the men, with a kind and cheering word for every company—a pleasant look, 
or kind salute, or hearty grasp of the hand for every officer or private with 
whom he is brought on speaking terms by business; and in a fight he is always at
 the front of the column, in the thickest of the danger, encouraging his soldiers
 by cheering word and fearless deed. He takes soldier's fare with the rest, 
asking no better food, and no more luxurious bed than the newest-recruited 
private under his command. If he sees a man without proper shoes or clothing he 
has that man with his Captain sent to his own quarters, where the man is served 
with the garments he needs and the Captain receives a reprimand that leads him 
to look more closely after the comfort of his men in future."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the arrival of the Bohemian, from Portland, we 
have New York telegrams to the 7th inst. Congress assembled on the 2nd, and 
immediately passed resolutions thanking Captain Wilks for his arrest of the 
"traitors" Slidell and Mason. Resolutions were also voted which requested the 
President to confine these two gentlemen in the cells of convicted felons until
 Colonels Corcoran and Wood should be treated as prisoners of war. Mr. Eliot, 
of Massachusetts, offered a series of resolutions declaring that the war is 
waged simply for the re-establishment of the Union, but insisting upon the 
right of the President to emancipate all persons held as slaves in any militay 
district in a state of insurrection, and advising such a course. The House
 refused to veto the resolution—by seventy against fifty-six—but its 
consideration was postponed for a week. In the Senate Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois,
 gave notice of a bill to confiscate the property of rebels and to give freedom 
to persons in the Slave States. On the second day the President's Message was 
received and read, and the reports of the several Departments of State were 
handed in to the Senate and House of Representatives, except that of the 
Secretary of the Treasury, which would not be ready for a few days. 
Subsequently, Messrs. Breckinridge and Burnett, of Kentucky, were expelled from 
Congress; and a committee had been appointed by the House to inquire into the 
expediency of abolishing slavery in the district of Columbia.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.</p>

<p>After congratulating the country on its abundant harvests, the President 
refers to the foreign relations of the Republic in these terms:-</p>
<q><p>You will not be surprised to learn that, in the 
peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been
 attended with profound solicitude, chiefy turning upon our own domestic
 affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole 
year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation 
which endures factions domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and
 one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign 
intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist
 the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures
 adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to 
those adopting them.</p>

<p>The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our 
country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have 
received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it 
were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign
 nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, said treaty obligations, 
would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, 
including especially the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not 
to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the 
destruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to 
believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I 
am quite sure a second argument could be made to show them that they can reach 
their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by 
giving encouragement to it.</p>

<p>The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations 
to hostility against us, as already intimated, to the embarrassment of commerce.
 Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union
 which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely have
 failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing 
difficulty, and that one strong nation produces more durable peace, and a more 
extensive, valuable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into 
hostile fragments.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign States, because, 
whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our country and
 the stability of our Government mainly depends, not upon them, but on the 
loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The 
correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted. I 
venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality 
towards foreign Powers, averting causes of irritation, and, with firmness, 
maintaining our own rights and honour. Since, however, it is apparent that here,
 as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic 
difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for 
maintaining the public defences on every side, while, under this general 
recommendation, provision for defending our coast line readily occurs to the 
mind. I also, in the same connection, ask the attention of Congress to our 
great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortications and 
dé;pôts of arms and munitions, with harbour and navigation 

improvements at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance 
to the national defence and preservation.</p></q>

<p>The President preserves a judicious silence on the affair of the Trent and 
San Jacinto.</p>

<p>On the vital subject of emancipation by the right of war, he uses the 
following guarded yet significant language:—</p>

<q>In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing
 the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict 
for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless 
revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it proper to 
keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest 
on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to
 the more deliberate action of the Legislature. In the exercise of my best
 discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, 
instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the
 last Session for closing those ports. So, also, obeying the dictates of 
prudence as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending I have 
adhered to the Act of Congress to confiscate property, and for insurrectionary 
purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed its propriety 
will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable
 means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and
 extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are 
indispensable.</q>

<p>The appropriations for the service of the next fiscal year are computed for a
 force of 500,000 men. He says he has a surplus of cavalry, and will reduce that
 expensive arm of the service. Although Congress only authorised a levy of
 500,000, the Secretary could have raised 1,000,000 of men as easily as not. 
The rapidity with which the Army, which in April amounted to 16,000 regulars, 
developed into a force of 640,000 surpasses anything of the sort exhibited by 
France when her destinies were in the hands of Napoleon. He has no doubt that, 
in case of emergency, the United States could send into the field a force of
 3,000,000 of armed men. "The effort to restore the Union" is termed "the most 
gigantic endeavour in the history of civil war." The check of Bull Run gave no 
discouragement, and merely postponed the campaign for a few months. The
 possession of Western Virginia, and the occupation of Hatteras and Beaufort 
have, moreover, already redeemed "our transient reverses." Mr. Cameron alludes 
to the urgent need which the army had of a supply of improved firearms. The 
resources of the United States' armoury at Springfield being quite inadequate 
to the occasion, contracts were made with private establishments, and a special
 agent was sent to Europe to purchase 2,000,000 dols. worth. The Government 
ought to have in store never less than a million of muskets, and a corresponding
 proportion of arms and equipments for cavalry and artillery. On the subject of 
the coast defences he says:—</p>

<p>It is of great importance that immediate attention should be given to the 
condition of our fortifications upon the seaboard and the lakes, and upon our 
exposed frontiers. They should at once be placed in perfect condition for 
successful defence. Aggressions are seldom made upon a nation ever ready to 
defend its honour and to repel insults; and we should show to the world that, 
while engaged in quelling disturbances at home, we are able to protect ourselves
 againat attacks from abroad.</p>

<p>He recommends that the accommodations at the celebrated Military Academy at 
West Point, which now contains only 192 cadets, be enlarged so as to allow of 
the education of 500 trained officers. He suggests that the distinction between 
regulars and volunteers should be abolished. He admits that recruiting for the 
regular army has been a failure. He demands that another line of railroad be 
constructed from Baltimore to Washington, as absolutely necessary for the supply
 of the troops in the event of the Potomac being closed by ice or a blockade. 
The paragraphs favourable to the arming of the slaves are printed in some of 
the New York journals, although they were stricken out by Mr. Lincoln himself, 
after Mr. Cameron had refused to expunge them with his own hand.</p>

<p rend="center">REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.</p>

<p>Secretary Welles reports that the navy was called upon to blockade a coast 
line of nearly 3000 miles to keep the navigation of the Potomac open, to 
organise combined military and naval expeditions against points of the Southern
 coast, and to pursue the privateers. When the vessels now building and 
purchased of every class are armed, equipped, and ready for service the 
condition of the navy will be as follows:—</p>

number of seamen in the service on the 4th of March last was 7600. The number 
is now not less than 22,000.</p>

<p>Since the institution of the blockade 153 vessels, sailing under various

<p>The naval estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1862, would amount

<p rend="center">THE POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S REPORT.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair announces that he has accepted the offer made in 1857 by Great 
Britain for a reduction of the international rate between the two countries on 
letters from 1s. to 6d., which, however, has not yet gone into operation, as it
 awaits the response of the British office. The excess of expenditure over 
receipts in 1861 was 5,391,000 dols.; the estimated deficiency in 1862 is 
3,145,000 dols.</p>

<p>The Postmaster-General defends his conduct in excluding "peace-party" journals
 from the mails. He finds his views supported by the authority of the late Chief
 Justice Story, whose opinion he quotes.</p>

<p>Mr. Thurlow Weed, who is at present in this country, contradicts the 
statement that General Scott has returned to America in obedience to an urgent 
request from his Government. Mr. Weed states that the veteran General has gone
 back to Washington solely from a desire to be "at his post" at a time of 
"threatened danger."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Last</hi> week it seemed difficult to obtain attention 
for any subject save that of the American crisis. "Who can tell what a day may 
bring forth?" To-day, in the presence of the heavy affliction with which it has 
pleased the Almighty and Inscrutable to visit our beloved Sovereign and the 
nation, even the solemn situation in which we have been placed by the piratical 
act of the Americans is momentarily disregarded while we seek to realise the 
sudden sorrow. But the record of the week must be duly completed.</p>

<p>President Lincoln's Message, as a composition, is conceived in the same low 
moral tone and executed with the same maladroitness which have characterised 
the preceding State Papers of his Government. But such considerations are of 
small importance compared with the indications of policy afforded by the 
document. There is no mention of the Trent outrage. From this circumstance, and
 from a meaningless declaration that the President does not desire hostilities 
with England, some sanguine writers have hastened to assume that the act of 
Captain Wilks will be disavowed, and the Southern Commissioners handed over to 
us. It is urged that Mr. Lincoln did not deem the act of the American Captain 
as worthy of notice in the Message, or that it is one upon which England has but
 to express her feeling to obtain immediate atonement. And this view is 
supported by reference to the fact that an actual wrong to British subjects is
 mentioned, and Congress is recommended to make compensation. We should be too 
happy to believe that so wise a course was that designed for adoption by the 
American Government, but we are afraid to resign ourselves to so agreeable a 
hope. It contradicts the general expression of that part of the American public
 which makes itself heard, and which exercises a fatal control over the so-called
 government of the American press (with one or two honourable exceptions), and 
of the American Secretary of State. The House of Representatives has 
deliberately offered a vote of thanks to the pirate Wilks; and though it is
 technically true that this is not precisely the same thing as a vote of our
 House of Commons, it is equally true, and more to the purpose, that the House
 of Representatives expresses the sentiments of those who, to the disgrace of 
the higher classes in the States, are permitted to engross political power. In 
the face of all these demonstrations, to say nothing of an official utterance 
by the head of the Federal Navy, we dare scarcely believe that the despatch of 
Earl Russell will receive the only answer which we can accept. Still we have 
only to wait and hear. Our next Impression will, in all probability, contain 
the expected intelligence. The news regarding the struggle between the North 
and South merely states that General M'Clellan has not moved, "nor will he move
 until he is certain to win "—a somewhat indefinite date. We learn with 
something akin to disgust that the barbarous reprisal system is likely to come 
into effect, that prisoners are being cruelly treated, and may be actually 
executed in cold blood—facts which reduce a war to an abominable brigandage. 
The North, in its excess of zeal for civilisation, is also elaborately 
destroying harbours in the South, thus by savage acts giving the lie to the 
profession of belief that the territory to which the harbours belong will ever 
again be a portion of the Federal dominions.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi> Malta correspondent, writing on the 10th 
of December says:— "Orders have been received to dispatch, as speedily as
 possible, all the disposable ships of war to Gibraltar, for the purpose, it is 
rumoured, of having the ready, in case of war with the North American States, to 
send off into American waters. Two line-of-battle ships, the Algiers, 89, and 
the Queen, 80, and a gun-boat, the Alacrity, 4, have already left; and two other
 liners, the Agamemnon, 91, and the James Watt, 91, and another gun-boat, the 
Foxhound, 4, will leave for the same destination as soon as they are ready for 
sea, probably about Saturday next. The sloop Firebrand, 6, which arrived here 
on the 8th from Gibraltar, was ordered back again immediately, and left on the 
9th. Two frigates, the Amphion, 36, from Messina, and the Liffey, 51, from Corfu,
 have been likewise ordered off by telegraph for the Straits. It is reported that
 the naval force now assembling there in such haste will be still further 
augmented by some of the ships from the coast of Syria.</p>

tween detached bodies were continually occurring. The accompanying Illustration,
 from a Sketch by our Special Artist in the Federal camp, shows a skirmish which
 took place a short time ago near Fall's Church, Virginia, between a body of the
 14th New York (Brooklyn) Regiment and a troop of Confederate cavalry. The 14th
 were surprised while out foraging, and, after a smart skirmish, both parties 
separated, the Confederates, who lost three men, carrying off with them 
thirty-six prisoners and six waggons. The remainder of the 14th fell back on 
their supports with their wounded, leaving some dead on the ground.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Illustration represents a portion of the 
boundary line where it crosses the Grand Trunk Railway or rather that branch of
 it which connects the Atlantic port of Portland, in the State of Maine, with 
the line between Montreal and Quebec. The boundary line is straight at this 
point, but afterwards becomes exceeding crooked, following the courses of 
streamlets and a portion of the River St. John. Where the line passes through 
the wildernesses the trees have been cut down so as to leave an open 
avenue—stone posts being set up at intervals. A short distance north, on the 
Canadian side of this line, are situated good towns and villages, being the
 eastern townships of Canada. Between them and the United States there exists
 no physical barrier: we may, therefore, assume that in the event of war it is 
upon this portion of the
colony that the first blow will fall.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the arrival of the City of Baltimore we have 
telegrams from New York to the evening of the 13th inst. Congress has not done 
anything of importance except to pass a resolution in favour of the adoption of 
measures for an exchange of prisoners. The President has refused for the present
 to furnish that body with the correspondence between the Federal Government and
 foreign Powers relative to the European intervention in Mexico.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S DIPLOMACY.</p>

<p>A mass of correspondence between Mr. Seward and the American Ministers in 
Europe has been presented to Congress. The matters treated of relate to the 
concession of belligerent rights to the Confederate States, at which Mr. Seward 
is highly offended, and to the adhesion of the United States to the Declaration 
of the Congress of Paris relative to maritime rights, an adhesion which Great 
Britain and France would only receive without prejudice to the rights of the 
seceded States, and which was therefore withdrawn by the United States. The 
dispatch of reinforcements to Canada was also complained of, but justified on
 the ground of the distrust of the United States' Government entertained by 
that of Great Britain and of the vague menaces uttered by Mr. Seward.</p>

<p rend="center">THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 0F THE TREASURY.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase in July estimated the expenditure of the current fiscal year 
(July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1862) at 318,520,000 dollars; but, in consequence of
 the increased number of men levied for the army, his amended estimate is raised
 to 532,520,000 dollars. Of this aggregate he has already raised by loans the 
sum of 197,243,000 dollars. The revenue, which he had estimated would produce 
80,000,000 dollars, had, partly owing to Congress refusing to pass measures he
 had recommended, and partly owing to the depression of trade, so fallen off 
that he only expected to receive 54,500,000 dollars from it. For the purpose of
 filling up the deficit, the Secretary recommends the confiscation of the 
property of rebels, whether found in the loyal or disloyal States, but his main
 reliance is on loans and taxation. He recommends that the duty on brown sugar
 should be increased to 2½  cents per pound, on clayed sugar 3 cents, 
on green tea to 20 cents, and on coffee to 5 cents. He further recommends that 
the direct tax be increased, so as to produce 20,000,000 dollars from the loyal
 States alone, and not only their proportion of the same, on the fiction that 
all the States were loyal. He has a plan of excise and stamp taxes. He proposes
 duties on stills and distilled liquors, on tobacco, bank-notes, on carriages, 
legacies, evidences of debt, and instruments for the conveyance of property and
 other like subjects, such as will produce 20,000,000 dols. more. From the 3 per
 cent income tax he hopes to procure ten millions more. The whole direct and
 indirect taxes will thus produce 90,000,000 dols. This sum is small compared
 with the aggregate property and annual earnings of the people.</p>

<p>The Secretary's great resource lies in supplanting the banks. Their 
circulation in the loyal States and Western Virginia amounts to about 
150,000,000 dols. He argues that this currency is a loan from the people to the
 banks, costing the latter nothing but the expense of issue and redemption and
 the interest on the specie kept in hand. These advantages ought to be 
transferred from the stockholders of the banks to the national Government. He 
claims to find authority in the United States' Constitution for this measure, 
under the powers to regulate commerce and the value of coin. His method of issue
 is to hand this national currency to the banks, who shall secure their 
redemption by pledge of United States' stocks and an adequate provision of 
specie. The people will thus have a uniform currency and the Government enjoy 
the advantages of a loan without interest. The competition of local bank-notes 
is to be annihilated by a special tax. He estimates the specie now in the
 United States at 275,000,000 dols. Existing Acts of Congress enable the 
Secretary to raise 75,000,000 dols. more than he has yet raised on bonds and 
Treasury notes payable on demand, and 50,000,000 dols. more must be raised by 
another loan.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year 1863 no reliable estimates can be made. The Secretary 
hopes that the present war will be over before midsummer; but in order to be 
prepared for all eventualities he submits estimates based on the hypothesis 
that the war will continue. These estimates (including 43,000,000 dols. as 
interest on debt) amount to 475,331,000 dols., of which 95,800,000 may be 
raised by revenue, leaving a balance to be provided for of 379,531,000 dols.
 On July 1, 1862, the Public Debt will be 517,373,000 dols., and on the above 
hypothesis 897,373,000 dols, on July 1, l863. He thinks the loyal States alone 
could pay off this latter sum in thirty years. Of the 72,000,000 dols. worth of
 bullion deposited in the United States' Mint in 1861, 37,000,000 dollars came 
from Europe. The Secretary closes his report by recommending the adoption of an
 international decimal system of weights, measures, and coins.</p>

<p>The bankers and financiers do not relish the propositions of Mr. Chase, so 
far as they relate to the suppression of the bank currency.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federals were about to occupy Tybee Island, at the entrance to the 
Savannah River.</p>

<p>Federal accounts state that the late artillery duel at Fort Pickens resulted
 in no harm to the fort, but that Warrington and part of the Pensacola Navy-yard
 were burnt.</p>

<p>A Government agent had been appointed to superintend the packing of cotton by
 the aid of the negroes in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> attention of the Canadian people at the 
present juncture (says the <hi rend="italic">Halifax Reporter</hi>) is wisely
 directed to the all-important question of "national defences." There appears
 to be a prevalent impression, which is rapidly gaining ground among all classes
 of people, that they must take immediate measures to provide for the security
 of the province in case of a sudden invasion from across the borders. The 
unsatisfactory state of relations between England and the United States brings 
home forcibly to every intelligent man the necessity of preparing for any 
emergency. According to late Canadian papers, the military authorities are
 making their preparations slowly and surely; but still it is obvious that, 
unless the people themselves afford united assistance, Canada, the upper 
province especially, would in case of war be in a most perilous position. In 
Quebec, and other parts of Lower Canada, there are fortifications of an 
impregnable character; but in Western Canada, with the exception of Kingston, 
we believe there are none of any importance or strength. The cities of Toronto,
 Hamilton, London, and the towns of Niagara, Windsor (opposite Detroit), and a
 hundred other places, would be in most imminent danger if a war were to break
 out suddenly—during the winter or spring, for instance. All the fighting, in
 fact, in Upper Canada would have to be done in the open field or behind 
hastily-constructed batteries and earthworks. The importance, then, of forming
 a volunteer organisation all through the country is becoming a matter which 
cannot be disputed by any man of foresight who values the safety of the 
province. Already there is a general movement made to establish volunteer 
companies and we are told that "there is every reason to believe that much will
 be done to place the militia forces of the country on a better footing than 
they are at present, and thus to make this arm of the service perfectly reliable
 in case of emergency." The militia, we may mention, in Canada, as well as in 
all the provinces, is almost a nonentity—little else than an undisciplined mob;
 and, unless steps are taken to drill and discipline it, it would be useless in
 the field. This fact is being generally recognised on all sides, and the 
prospect is that there will soon be a change some way for the better. In 
Montreal a general calling out of the provincial militia for drill during the 
winter is spoken of. In Toronto the <hi rend="italic">Leader</hi> is urging
 upon the officers of the sedentary militia the propriety of resigning their 
commissions or else taking immediate steps to become acquainted with their 
drill, and in many places all over the province it is said there is a desire
 among the sedentary officers to join with the active volunteers in order to
 learn their drill. Still, the impression amongst men of good judgment and 
discernment is that there is little reliance to be pleased on the militia, and
 that the best and surest mode of providing for the defence of the province is
 to form a volunteer regiment in every locality.</p>

<p>In Halifax (says the <hi rend="italic">Reporter</hi>) the old militia law
 has entirely gone out of practice and given place to the volunteer system. 
Nowhere in the British provinces, indeed, have the young men responded more 
heartily to the call to form themselves into corps for defence than in Nova 
Scotia; and few, if any, of the colonies can present an equal number of 
well-drilled and organised companies. Still, however, gratifying as has been 
the success that has attended the laudable efforts of the promoters of the 
volunteer movement, a great deal more might be done in the way of increasing 
the number of the forces all over the country. Both the Lieutenant-Governor 
and General Doyle, on the occasion of the recent volunteer inspection, very 
properly made some observations on the importance of obtaining additional 
strength to the volunteer ranks; and it is to be hoped that their advice will
 have some effect with the large numbers of young men who have as yet, all over
 the province, kept aloof from the movement. Very lately, in Bridgetown and 
Picton, an effort has been made, and successfully too, to form a volunteer 
company in each of these places; and it would be satisfactory and encouraging
 to see a similar spirit evinced in every town and village throughout this 
province. Let this be done, and we would soon, like the mother country, be in
 a position to present a body of "living walls" that could successfully repel
 any force that might invade our shores.</p>

<p>At the present moment perhaps no subject is of so much interest and 
importance as the facilities for the transport of troops over from Halifax to 
Quebec. The following statement, derived from a gentleman who has recently 
travelled through New Brunswick, from Quebec to Halifax, will be found 
interesting:—" On disembarking at Halifax the troops can be conveyed by rail 
to Windsor, Nova Scotia, about sixty miles, from which point they can take 
steamers across the Bay of Fundy (which, contrary to popular ideas, is never 
frozen over) to St. Stephen's, a distance of about 170 miles. From St. 
Stephen's, a small town of about 4000 inhabitants, there is a railway open to 
Canterbury, twelve miles from Woodstock, one of the largest towns in New 
Brunswick. From Canterbury to Woodstock the distance can either be marched over
 a good snow road or performed in sleighs. From Woodstock a day's journey will
 convey the troops to Great Falls, a distance of 72 miles, over excellent roads.
 From Great Falls the next stage is to Lake Port, a small place on the 
Temiscouta, and thence by sleigh over a very good new military road (which is
 kept open by the mail track three times a week, and by the operations of the 
lumberers), they will arrive at the Riviére du Loup. Forty-two miles of
 this latter portion of the journey, and during which the only practical
 inconvenience that will be experienced is through a forest district called the
 Portage, involving an ascent of upwards of 1000 feet. At all the points named 
the troops could be supplied with refreshments and lodgings in the houses, 
barns, and outbuildings. The only scarcity with regard to provisions is in the 
article or flour, as very little grain is grown in the district over which this
 route passes. There is, however, abundance of beef and other provisions. From 
the Riviére du Loup the troops will be conveyed by railway, a distance 
of 115 miles, to Quebec."</p>

<p>Accounts from Kingston, Canada, of the 6th inst., denote much activity in 
military and warlike preparations. General Sir Fenwick Willliams, accompanied 
by Lieutenant-Colonel Robertson, Royal Engineers, and the members of the Staff,
 had made a thorough inspection of the facilities for fortifying Toronto. Guns 
of heavy calibre were to be placed along the margin of the bay in the vicinity 
of the Nadaud Old Forts. Workmen were immediately to commence repairing the 
blockhouses. The men of the 30th Regiment were busily employed in the use of 
heavy guns. A party of Engineers, Sappers and Miners, had gone to Quebec, and 
a number of them would immediately be dispatched westward. Mr. S. Cunard had 
gone to Quebec at the request of the Canadian Government. The 62nd and another 
regiment were to be sent to this province; and it was thought some arrangement 
was likely to be effected with the Cunard Company to bring up these troops at 
least as far as Riviére du Loup before the close of the navigation.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> a few days from the time of our publication 
England will, in all probability, be made aware of the intentions of the American
 Government. If Mr. Lincoln has the courage to act up to his own convictions, 
and to defy the menaces of an infuriated mob, Messrs. Mason and Slidell are by
 this time on their way to our shores. But we have no great hope that such will
 be the freight of the vessel now hastening to Liverpool. It is true that 
ultimately the Government that shall provoke a contest with England will go down
 in disgrace when the ignorant and angry myriads who now denounce us are 
excited to frenzy by the chastisement which, in the event of war, England will 
inflict. It is true that, in the presence of disasters, no American Government,
 save that of military despotism, will be able to endure; and therefore that it
 is a choice of evils which the Lincoln Cabinet has before it. But with a 
certain class of minds the immediate danger is always more terrible than the 
remote one, and these are the chances for Messrs. Lincoln and Seward to reckon
 upon—the possible capital to be made out of a great success by General 
M'Clellan, and the possible interposition of European Powers between England and
 the Northern States. Of two evils choose the most distant, is a favourite
 variation upon a well-known rule; and we are disposed to believe that Mr.
 Lincoln will prefer to hear the distant cannon of Britain rather than the yell
 of a mob under the windows of the White House. Therefore we do not look for a
 message of peace, though we hope for it, so far as hope is consistent with a
 calm examination of the case.</p>

<p>At the same time we are glad to believe that the French notification will
 have its weight with the American Government. Nothing can be more distinct 
than this document, and it points out so lucidly to Mr. Lincoln that Captain
 Wilks has committed an outrage, that the reasoning must be convincing, whatever the resolutions of the President may be. There can be no doubt of the valuable
 character of this State paper, inasmuch as it testifies to the European world 
that the first of the Continental Powers takes the side of England. It may also
 have the advantage of inducing Mr. Lincoln to reconsider his position and to 
devise some means of extricating himself from it without the fatal appeal. We 
speak, of course, of the document, not as if it had been composed at the period
 at which it was issued, but as the embodiment of a decision which was doubtless
 perfectly well known to our Foreign Minister when he sent the despatch to 
America. We cannot suppose that diplomatists acting in concert, as those of 
France and England are understood to do tarried for the issue of a formal 
despatch. They must have been in perfect accord at the time the demand of 
England left these shores; and the President was at once made aware that, though
 England desires no physical aid in any contest into which she may be called to
 enter, she has, and is glad to have, the moral support of the Imperial 
Government. We can only say again that we wish to believe Mr. Lincoln strong 
enough to listen to reason and justice.</p>

<p rend="center">REINFORCEMENTS FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The Tower has lately been the scene of great bustle, owing to the 
preparations for sending military stores to Canada. Night and day, on Sundays as
 well as other days, men have been engaged packing arms, clothing, and other 
necessaries to a great amount, which are placed on sailing-barges moored 
alongside the quays; the stores are taken thence down the river, and shipped on
 board the transports now off Deptford and Woolwich.</p>

<p>On the morning of Thursday week a great number of persons assembled at an 
early hour at the Wellington Barracks, St. James's Park, on the occasion of the
 departure of the 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards and of the 2nd battalion
 of the Fusilier Guards for Canada. The 1st battalion of the Grenadier Guards, 
800 strong, under the command of Colonel the Hon. Hugh Manvers Percy, C.B. 
(Victoria Cross), assembled, shortly after six o'clock, on the parade at the 
Wellington Barracks, preparatory to their departure for Southampton. After a 
due inspection, and after partaking of breakfast, at half-past seven o'clock 
the battalion left for the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. Owing 
to the death of the Prince Consort the regimental baud did not accompany the
 battalion to the station. On their arrival at the terminus the men were told 
off in fours, and with the greatest facility—the system having been initiated 
by the late General Torrens—the train started at eight o'clock with its gallant
 burden; so that the entire battalion, each man carrying his rifle and a cooked 
ration, left quarters and started by railway to their destination within half 
an hour. The men were loudly cheered as they proceeded to the railway. The 2nd 
battalion of the Scots Fusiliers, of the same strength, commanded by Colonel 
William John Ridley, left the Wellington Barracks at eight o'clock, and pursued
 the same route—along Birdcage-walk, Great George-street, and across Westminster-bridge. The same excellent arrangements were observed, and without 
slightest confusion or delay the battalion departed at half-past eight o'clock 
for its destination. As the detatchments reached the docks on arriving at 
Southampton, they were received by the Southampton Volunteer Rifle Corps, and 
escorted to their respective ships by the band. The troops were cheered as they 
left the docks an by immense crowd of persons.</p>

<p>The steamer Adriatic, with the Grenadier Guards, and the Parana, with the 
Scots Fusilier Guards and the eighteenth company of the Royal Engineers, left 
the docks about two o'clock in the afternoon and anchored in the river. Both 
vessels sailed for their destination early on the following morning. The Parana 
had a berth in the docks close to the Nashville, the Confederate man-of-war. As
 she was leaving her berth, with the Guards on board, the band struck up the 
tune, "I'm off to Charleston so early in the morning," The officers of the 
Nashville were watching the departure of the Parana with apparently considerable
 interest.</p>

<p>Each soldier destined for Canada, on stepping on board of his transport, 
finds ready for him two pairs of woollen drawers, one jersey, two
merino under-vests, two pair of worsted stockings, one comforter, one chamois leather 
waistcoat, one sealskin cap with ear-mufflers, one pair of sealskin mits, one 
pair of Canadian boots, and one sheepskin coat.</p>

<p>The Royal Mail Company's steamer Magdalena, Captain Woolward, with the 16th 
Foot (about 1000 strong) on board, took her departure from Southampton last 
Saturday afternoon. She is under orders to sail for Halifax direct.</p>

<p>The Cunard Company's Royal Mail steam-ship Asia, which sailed from Liverpool
 on Saturday for Halifax, carrying the mails for Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick, Canada, and other portions of North America, also took out about 470 
military passengers, and nearly 200 tons of warm clothing, camp equipage,
 &amp;c. The military arrived at Liverpool early on Saturday morning by special 
trains from Woolwich and Aldershott, and they were promptly conveyed in steam 
tenders to the Asia, lying at anchor in the Sloyne. The Asia sailed about 11:30
 a.m., with an easterly wind, and every prospect of making a rapid passage to 
Queenstown. Amongst the military passengers there were the staff for the army 
in Canada.</p>

<p>The Flying Fish sailed yesterday week for Lisbon, with sealed orders and 
despatches.</p>

<p>Orders have been received at the camp at Colchester for volunteering for the 
15th, 17th, 36th, 47th, 62nd, 63rd, and 96th Regiments, which are destined for
 Canadian service, and which are short of their full complement of men.</p>

<p>The Government having decided on forming a reserve of troops at Bermuda, for 
operations in North America, orders were on Sunday received at Chatham for the 
fifth company of Royal Engineers to hold itself in immediate readiness to embark
 for Bermuda at an hour's notice.</p>

<p>Admirality instructions were received on Saturday directing the whole of the 
screw gun-boats attached to the first division of the steam reserve at Chatham 
to be removed from the several ports on the Medway for immediate service.</p>

<p>The following further arrangements for the embarkation of troops for Canada 
have been completed:—the Hibernian will sail from Liverpool for New Brunswick,
 taking the fourth company of the Royal Engineers—5 officers and 120 men; the G
 (Captian Hoste's) battery of the fourth brigade Royal Artillery, from 
Aldershott—7 officers and 255 men; the sixth battery of the tenth brigade Royal 
Artillery (Captain Robinson's), from Woolwich—6 officers and 117 men; a 
detachment of the  first battalion 15th Foot—4 officers and 147 men. The 
Canadian mail-steamer will take from Liverpool the seventh battery of the 
tenth brigade Royal Artillery (Captain Child's), from Woolwich—6 officers and 
117 men; and the eighth battery of the same brigade (Captain M'Rea's)—6 officers
 and 117 men; the seventh battery for Halifax, the eighth for Newfoundland, the 
fifth company of the Royal Engineers for Bermuda—4 officers and 100 men; and 6 
men of the Army Hospital Corps for New Brunswick. The detachment of Royal 
Engineers under orders to embark in the Victoria will sail in the Calcutta.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">M. Hautefeuille On The Trent Case</hi>—Under the title "Questions of Maritime 
International Law," one of the first French authorities on that branch of 
jurisprudence, M. Hautefeuille, the learned author of "The History of Maritime 
International Law," and of "The Treatise on the Rights and Duties of Neutral 
Nations during Naval Warfare," has just given to the world a careful examination
 of the various questions involved in the Trent and Nashville cases. M. 
Hautefeulle divides the subject under three heads: admitting the right of search,
 he declares that the Captain of the American frigate "violated all the rules 
relating to the right of search." He asserts, "The reply to the question put is,
 therefore—First, that in no case can there exist contraband of war on a 
neutral vessel sailing between two neutral ports. Second, that even if there
 were contraband of war, the sole right of the cruiser would be to seize the 
vessel and to carry it into one of the ports of his own country to have it 
legally sentenced. Third, that persons cannot in any case be considered as 
contraband of war. Fourth, that Messrs. Slidell and Mason, not being in the 
military service of the Southern Confederation at the moment of their arrest, 
could not be carried off from the neutral vessel in which they were sailing. 
From these answers it evidently results that Captain Wilks has committed a 
violation of all the principles regulating international relations." He also 
decides that President Lincoln has not the right to seize and make prisoners 
the inhabitants and officials of the Southern Confederation wherever he can 
find them, although he has the right to regard them as rebels.</p>

<p>M. Thouvenel, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, has addressed the 
following highly important despatch to the representative of France at 
Washington:—</p>

<p rend="center">THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO THE FRENCH MINISTER AT 
WASHINGTON.</p>

<p rend="right">Paris, Dec. 3, 1861.</p>

<p>Monsieur,—The arrest of MM. Mason and Slidell on board the English packet 
Trent by an American cruiser has produced in France, if not the same emotion in
 England, at least great astonishment and an extreme sensation.</p>

<p>Public opinion at once inquired, with anxiety for the consequences, whether 
such an act could possibly be legitimate, and there cannot be the slightest doubt
 of the general impression. The act seems to the public so entirely at variance
 with the ordinary rules of international law that it throws the responsibility
 exclusively upon the commander of the San Jacinto.</p>

<p>We cannot know yet whether this supposition is well founded, and the 
Emperor's Government has therefore felt called upon to consider the question 
raised by the capture of the two passengers on board the Trent. The desire to
 contribute to prevent a conflict, which is perhaps imminent, between two Powers
 towards whom it is animated by equally friendly sentiments, and the duty of 
maintaining—with a view to put the rights of its own flag beyond the danger of 
attack—certain principles essential to the security of neutrals, have, after 
mature reflection, convinced the French Government that it cannot remain 
completely silent under existing circumstances.</p>

<p>If, to our great regret, the Washington Cabinet should be disposed to approve
 the conduct of the commander of the San Jacinto, they must consider MM. Slidell
 and Mason either as enemies or as rebels. In either case there would be an 
extremely regretable forgetfulness of principle, on which we have always found 
the United States agreed with us.</p>

<p>On what ground, in the first supposed case, can the American cruiser have 
arrested MM. Mason and Slidell? The United States have admitted, with us, in 
treaties concluded between the two countries, that the freedom of the flag 
extends to persons found on board, even though they be enemies, except in the 
case of military men actually in the service of the enemy. MM. Mason and Slidell
 were, therefore, by virtue of this principle, which we have never found any 
difficulty in getting inserted in our treaties of friendship and commerce, 
perfectly free under the neutral flag of England.</p>

<p>It will not, doubtless, be presented that they could be considered as 
contraband of war. What constitutes contraband of war is not, it is true, 
precisely settled; the limits are not absolutely the same for all Powers; but,
 as far as regards persons, the stipulations found in treaties relative to 
military persons clearly define the character of the individuals who alone are 
liable to be captured by belligerents.</p>

<p>Now, it cannot be necessary to demonstrate that MM. Mason and Slidell can in
 no way be assimilated to persons in this category. There would, therefore, 
remain no ground to explain their capture but the pretext that they were bearers
 of official despatches from the enemy. But this is the place to call to mind 
a circumstance which overrides the whole case, and shows the conduct of the 
American cruiser to have been unjustifiable.</p>

<p>The Trent was not bound to a point belonging to either of the belligerents.
 It was carrying its cargo and passengers to a neutral country; and, moreover, 
it was at a neutral port that it had taken them up. If it were admissible that, 
under such circumstances, the neutral flag did not completely cover the persons
 and goods transported under it, the immunity of that flag would be a vain word;
 the commerce and navigation of third Powers would be liable to suffer at any 
moment for their innocent, or even indirect, relations with either of the 
belligerents. The latter would not only have a right to require from the neutral
 the most complete impartiality, and to interdict him from being mixed up in 
any way with acts of hostility, but they would inflict restrictions upon the 
liberty of commerce and navigation which modern international law refuses to 
acknowledge as legitimate. There would be a return, in a word, to those 
vexatious practices against which, in former times, no Power protested more 
energetically than the United States.</p>

<p>If the Washington Cabinet should regard the two persons arrested as rebels, 
whom it has always a right to seize, the question, though shifting its ground, 
could not be more resolved in a sense favourable to the commander of the San 
Jacinto. In such a case there would be a contempt of the principle in virtue
 of which a ship is held to be a portion of the territory whose flag it bears,
 and there would be a violation of the immunity which forbids a foreign 
Sovereign to exercise jurisdiction on that territory. It cannot doubtless be 
necessary to call to mind the energy with which the United States has, on 
every occasion, defended this immunity and the right of asylum which is a
 consequence of it.</p>

<p>Without wishing to enter upon a more thorough discussion of the question 
raised by the capture of MM. Mason and Slidell, I have said enough, I think, 
to show that the Cabinet of Washington cannot, without infringing those 
principles which all neutral Powers are alike interested in maintaining, nor 
without putting itself in contradiction with its own conduct up to the present 
time, give its approbation of the conduct of the San Jacinto. In this state of 
things the Cabinet of Washington cannot, in our opinion, hesitate as to the 
course to be taken.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons is already charged to present the demand for satisfaction which 
the English Cabinet is under the necessity of making, and which consists in the
 immediate release of the persons taken from the Trent, and explanations which 
shall relieve the act of the Captain of the San Jacinto of its offensive
 character to the British flag. The Federal Government would be inspired by a 
just and elevated sentiment in yielding to these demands. It is impossible to 
conceive any object or any interest that it could have to run the risk of
 provoking a rupture with Great Britain by assuming a different attitude.</p>

<p>For ourselves, who would see in such a rupture a complication in every way 
deplorable of the difficulties with which the Cabinet of Washington has already
 to struggle, and a proceeding calculated to occasion serious uneasiness to all
 the Powers not parties to the present conflict, we think we are giving a
 testimony of loyal friendship to the Cabinet of Washington in not concealing 
from it our opinion.</p>

<p>I request you. Sir, to take the first opportunity of speaking frankly with 
Mr. Seward, and, if he should desire it, to leave him a copy of this despatch.—
 Receive, &amp;c.,</p>
