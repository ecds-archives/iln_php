THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS.

LO!1L¡Olf SATURDAY, P2'E,WIJJiIO 12, 1882.

llvv for General Pope's aoertion that ho has gained a eiclccry we should be inclined to believe that the engagement b2tweou the Fcderiols end Confederates on Aug. fit had rosily been a Union success, it would seem that after a stubborn contest on the field of Bull Run the armies had separated, both having sustained heavy loss, but the Federals remaining in possession 1 of the ground. But the gallant Pope has rcndcred it a matter of duty with readers of his despatches to be cautions, and to await confirmation of lois statements whuu they notify, as they usually do, seam brilliant feat of arms on his part, We cannot forget that immense class of prisoners whom he took one hoc morning, soul wham ho must have immediately annihilated, as none of them wore ever seen in the flesh by mortal man save himself. He reports that the Confederates were "badly used" in this last engagement, and that he was about to proceed to. use theist still worse. The Now York people do not appeal, it their money market he an hidox to their leelings, to have been greatly reassured by this piece of in formation, which the C overunsent, after a long suppression of all news, perneitt'ut to be issued for the consolation of the North, We shall shortly have means of testing the veracity of General Pope. The levy was going on, according to the Northern prints, very satisfactorily, and it is reasocablu to suppose that the enormous bribe offered on enlistment must have produced it affect. Meantime, the President's candid declaration to Mr.

Oreelcy tied ibis is not an anti-slavery war, but that, on the

contrary. Mr. Lincoln is ready and anxious to place the slave system on the basis most acceptable to the South, if only the Union can be preserved, has drawn, angry comment from his friends in America and in England, and not unnaturally, for he has cost away the only ground upon which Englishmen could be asked to take an interest in the success of the North. His manifesto is certainly calculated to give a lively colour to his intimation to the blacks that they would do well to take them. solves out of the Union, ice which they are not, he tells them, fvouritos, and towards whose white constituents they have no particular reason to feel, kindly. Many of them are, it is said,
accepting this half-friendly notice to quit. As much as possible ia being made of the lush element, and it is evident that the Union relics in no small degree upon the swords of iTibernta, mercenaries. It will be a novelty in history should a State be found to have gained permanent strength by the aid of such auxiliaries
THE SITUATION IN AMERICA.

ASSUMING that the intelligence received at the beginning of this week bears with it that partial correctness which has characterised all accounts of late from the American con tinent7 no one in the civilised world out of Washington, and, we should imagine, scarcely any 0$ within that capital, will deny that the crisis of the internecine contest is at hand. The forote of the contending parties stand in such a position that all literally may depend upon one battle. A brief review of the events which have recently occurred is necessary to the elucidation and verification of such an assertion.

It maybe remembered that the accounts which preceded those which were received on Monday last, and which brought intelligence down to the 5th instant, extended to the 29th of last month, on which day, according to a despatch written on the following morning by General Pope, a fierce

battle had been fought between his corps -

and a Confederate force on the identical field of Bull Run which has become so famous in the history of the civil war. It

¥ may be said in passing that, like many other of General Pupa's statements in the despatch in question, this assertion is inexact, as the battle was actually fought

i at six miles distance from Bull Run. This -

battle the Federal General claimed as a -

victory, and concluded his despatch by

elating that the Confederates were retiring. / They did nothing of the kind, but on the / - -

morning of the 80th attacked General Pope's I -

corps with what is designated 11 fury, and ',

the Federals fell bad in disorder, the Con. federates rapidly pouringehut and shell into

the retreating msee. The Confederates -

broke the Federal contra and turned the Federal left, and, although the latter \- ufought with great bravery, and Pope made \ zqj,aaiu great efforts to retrieve the day, at five ' o'clock in the evening the left wing of \' his army gave- way, and retreated in \ BUR Run; while along tberoad oCentotvffleinfantry, cavalry, and waggons were mingled together in the inextricable confusion of a complete root. It is stated that the remainder of the force retreated in tollscable order to Contreville, where, on the following day, Pope was joined by two divisions \ of the army of the Potomac. On the lot of September General Banks, who was said to have been out off, also reached Centrevile with the force under his command, Hero it might have been supposed. that another stand would have been mailo; but so imminent was the danger. to Washington from a movement of the Confederates by way of Lecsburg, a few hales further to the north-west, that Ceatreville

 was abandoned on Tuesday, the 2nd inst., THE LATE DL 3 and the combined armies of Virginia and -

the Potomac were massed behind the intrenohincnts and fortifications which have been constructed for the defence of Washington, and, in fact, exactly in the position they occupied when they marched out for the invasion of the territory coon; pied by the Confederates. The latter are nearer Washington than they have yet been, and in a position more favourable for attack; for, instead of being massed around Ill anassae, they are in full force at a place called Vienna, on the Upper Potomac, only twelve miles distant from the Federal capital, and at a point where the river is fordable at the present season of the year. In short, the situation is completely changed; the

t'edernla stand at bay around their -chief city and seat of government ; and the Confederates, who have hitherto had to defend Richmond against the invading movements of the Northern forces, have it now in their power to become the aggressors in their turn, end it probably depends on the strength of the defences of Washington, and the chances of success by an investment of and ultimate assault on that city, whether they do not actually become the invaders this time.

While these disasters and reverses have been accumulating On the Federal forces in Virginia, the accounts from the west and other quarters are not more favourable to their cause. The troupe 4 the i'orth bad- been defeated, with loss of their artillery, in Kentucky, and had been forced to retreat to Lexington, which place, however, the had speedily to abandon. The FederalW were preparing to, evacuate Cyothiaoa, while from 20,000 to 80,000 Confederates occupied Lexington. Frankfort had also been abandoned by the Federala, while Louisville was threatened. In Tennessee there has been continued fighting; in Louisiana the recapture of B$ton Rouge had encouraged
the Confederates to attempt; the recovery of New Orleans, which city was menaced by Generals Breckenridge and Van Born, with a force variously stated at 20,000 and 30,000 men. Thus it appears that while the Northern party actually holds the coast line, it is but nominally master of the Mississippi; and everywhere beyond the reach of their naval armaments the fortune of war is adverse to the Federals. Six months of land warfare has brought their armies back to the point from which they started for that which was boasted to be a triumphant raid through the enemy's country; and they have to defend Washington with tens of thousands fewer disciplined troops than they possessed in the spring, to conduct the defence with maimed instruments, in the shape of beaten troops aided by new recruits, and this against an enemy gathered at an advantageous point, of great numerical strength, and naturally and justly flushed with success and elated by achievements from the merit of which their worst wishers cannot detract.

This statement of facts-and it is just

\ possible that they are not all the facts-we \ think, justify the proposition with which

\ we set out in the consideration of the \ momentous question involved-namely,

that the crisis in the civil wax in America has arrived. Of the issue of the next encounter between desperate men defending their last stroughold and foes with all the prestige of victory warming and urging them to still greater deeds, it is not easy to

-- utter predictions. We confess, however,

that the fact of the appointment of General M'Clellan to the chief command, in Washington seems to be an ill-omen for the Federal cause. This commander has / eminently illustrated the familiar saying which speaks of a person "going up '-ZS J lilac a rocket and coming down like its stick." It may be that he is really / the military prodigy that his friends J proclaimed him to be, and that he has been the victim of circumstances over which he had no control; but the fact is J/ patent that "viotery does not sit upon his J6JJI///j1iIllft 1]!/ helm ;" end he carries with him to his new 3uI/!/ffiI/i!/ / and most important command the disadvantages of failure, and is the very last General calculated to restore confidence to / troops who must be in the frame of mind of all soldiers driven to intrenchments and (77 fortifications within which they are bee / leaguered. We will not more than allude >1' to the rumours which have been prevalent that M'Clellan is at heart a Southerner, and by consequence a gigantic traitor, hut it is enough for our argument to say that be is not the man who can infuse into the army he commands the spirit which is essential to success.

SMaRT, PAGE s, On the other hand, the Confederate Generals have shown themselves eminently

vigilant and energetic, prompt to take advantage of every weaknoss or oversight or mistake of the enemy to which they have been opposed; they have co-operated with each other with almost mechanical exactness; and they have evidently been pursuing a plan of operations which was probably devised by some master-mind; they have mingled boldness with prudence, rapidity of movement with breadth of design; and it is no secret that recent success has tended to render it possible, and even likely, that the whole male population of the South capable of bearing arms will he at the disposal of the Confederate military chiefs; while it is equally well
bean that rerunning in the North is in anything but jemishing condition.

Lu this state of things the natural inquiry is, has not blood enough been shed? Are those hundreds of thousands of mined

en who stand opposite to each other to mix in mortal-nay, in extreme-combat which, if not decisive, must load to further draughts on both populations, to the manifest disadvantage of the North'? For, in order to supply new armies to protract a 'warfare already sufficiently exhaustive, the North must suspend its whole mdortrial and coiwnercial existence, and draw out its whole ionic population-youthful and middle-aged-to be literally expended like some consumable article of common use, while those who survive only become partners in defeat, and the broke]) instruments of military incompetency; and this while the agricultural South is being tilled and cultivated by the caine labourers who have always hitherto been attached to the soil in that character, and who are neither needed as, nor would they be permitted to be, combalants-namely, the negro population.

It is at this moment that one can most folly recognise the wisdom of that policy of nonintervention in the contest in America whith England has not only strictly observed herself hot has prevailed on France also to preserve. We stow see that it was possible for the parties to this quarrel to work it out for themselves, and by their own action to decide the fate of the Union. If it be the destiny of the South to become a self-constituted and self-existent Republic, such a result will have been brought about by her own means and her own operations alone; and, if the vexed question between the two races who have hitbcito formed together the United States is to be settled by the catablisliment of two States, it will be settled at once and for ever; but if the South had been bolstered sap into success by foreign nwrel inlers-rotlea, far less by active and material aid from any European Power, her title to a separate existence as a Power would not have been duly and truly established; and the time would have come when the North, with some show of reason on her side. might have demanded that the issue involved between the two parties should be submitted to the process of a near trial. This, at least, cannot be gainsaid-that theSautli has vindicated her right to be considered a State; and, looiieg to the situation of affairs as they stand between the Federals and Confederates, it seems clear that the time has arrived when the North and South can negotiate as State to 5 Mate and there can he but few, we imagine, who will deny that now is the moment when they ought to negotiate, upon what bade it is not for as to say, in plain language; hut it is implied in the opinion which we have exprenaad under a sense of what la due to that good feeling which, irrespective of party, we bear to that which has hitherto been the American nation.

THE SOUTHERN NATION AND THE

NORTHERN UNION.

Do the Southern States of America form a nation? if identity of origin and language; if community of thought, sentiment, feeling, passion, and interest; If pertinacity of purpose, through good and through evil fortune; if heroism, unsurpassed in

any age, exhibited amid -

privations, difficulties, and dangers, of a magnitude

of which the history of /

the world affords few ex

amples, and all devoted /

to the one great end of national independence, constitute a claim to the

title, the South is indeed a / nation, - one, homoge- / neous, and indivisible. /

Are the Northern States, / which deny and resist the /

claims of the South, themselves to be considered a nation? They are not of one blood and race. The original Anglo-Saxon dcInent by which they were pervaded two centuries ago has, been so largely diluted by a Celtic and Teutonic admixture that the English language remains the only natural bond of union between them. Nor is this bond so powerful as it may appear. The Germans in all the great cities of the north and west constitute a class apart, and imbibe few, if any, ideas from English and American literature and modes of thought. A Unilynewspaper published in the German language in the city of New York has a circulation of forty thousand. In many parts f the great State of rcnnsylvania it is ncoos ary that all public and Official announcement, should be made both in English and in German, n order that they may be fairly brought within the ogniesnse of the people. ['he same necessity exists n Ohio, where German iewspapers, theatres, hurches, and school8r ival hose of the Anglo-Saxon 'opulation in numbers, mportance, and wealth. Ube Irish Roman Catholics ores in all the Northern nd Western States an szpe-isna in impclio, oting together, under ccleaiastical guidance, or objects different from STATUE IN rnL8oi-SQUARE, Los. lose which actuate the

 Protestant and Puritanic sections of the people. In addition to these divergences which time is more likely to aggravate and extend than to diminish in the case of the Irish, there is no community of sentiment or interest between the several

States, or between the parties in each State that struggle for the management of affairs. On the great question of slavery, on which the South is a unit, the North is divided into irreconcilable factions. The Eastern States are bigots for protection to native industry ; the Western States either care nothing for native industry or look upon it as an evil that prevents the due expansion of the corn trade with Great Britain, their best friend and customer. Truly considorcd, the North is no more a

N, nation than Switzerland

orAustria. Itis simply a

- N, Government and a fede

ration, and holds together for convenience, as Switzerlend does, or by mill. tory power, ia Austria, ad not from sympathy or community of political or social sentiment.

There is no example in history of any united, homogeneous, and determined nation that was ever conquered by a disunited, heterogeneous, and irresolute opponent, however greatly the latter may have surpassed it in wealth and numbers. All experience proves that the sentiment of nationality is the strongest and most enduring of the many forces that urge men to war, and iinpoh them to persist in it in face of danger, dis

couragement, and tem-porary defeat until the

nationality becomes in

hi- umphiaut. In addition to

this it mush be remem-bered that the so-called

rebellion of the South is consistent with American

- - principles and history,

and that the attempt to

-- subdue that rebellion

'' on the part, of the Worth is illogical and inconsistent with the Constitution on which the North itself takes its stand as an ladependent country. If the North is logically right in thewaritiswaging against the South it is at this moment rightfully a portion of the British dominions, and all its Presidents, from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln, have been rebels I - against legal authority. It is nothing but physical force, illegal in its origin, which has decided the question the other Cr THE speN-Mcssuxca way; and it is to force not illegal in it origin
that the South has appealed, failing all other sitcoms to secure a separation. And the Sooth, with this argument to support its invincible determination, must ultimately succeed, or human nature in America is not the same as it has proved everywhere else in every age of the world.

This inherent weakness of the Northern cause ha.s long hero palpable to all European observers of the war, but is stubbornly ignored by Mr. Lincoln and the composite people whom it is his sad privilege to govern. The North might obtain a glinipee of the truth if it would seriously study one aspect of the military question which affects both itself and the South. The Southern Government has but to declare that the "nation' is in danger, end to demand the aid of all the ablebodied population between certain ages to confront and overcome that danger, and, it obtains without money to pay them all tile men it reqnirea-men who cheerfully forsake their wives and faatilies, their business and their estates, atthe call of duty, and fight without hope of other reward than the consciousness of patriotism. When the North is in the same duflioulty, and appeals to its people in the same fashion, the results tire lamentably different, Though it odors the common soldier a rate of payment higher than that of a Lieutenant in the Austrian set vice, though it gladly accepts foreigners fresh from the emigraut-ship, though it piles bounty open bounty, and offers in some dia triete as much as 000 daIs., or £100 sterling, per man as an inducement to serve even for nine months, it fails to got togo tIter the armies for which it calls. And, worse than all, these armies, even if obtained, would be insufficient to conquer the South if they were thrice as numerous. The North refuses to leak at thus ugly symptom of its ease, and vainly hopes that by higher end still higher offers of demomlising bounty-money i may bribe a sufficient number of mercenary adventurers to fight the West battle-which such adventurers are as certain to lean as the love of country is a stronger incentive to earnest warfare then the love of dollars.

 Every day that passes proves more and more forcibly that the North is in a dilemma. The pride of the people is se great and the authority of the Government so small that it cannot msko the first offer of concession, According to all present appearances the war may last for a quarter of a canneryblaring up fiercely at one piece and smouldering in another

is needless to recapitulate.

Were there a faint prospect that the North might yet prevnil a timid Emmespean Power ]night hesitate even non' to do seammty justice to the Noetls bat thieve is no such prospect to justify even ii second or third rate Power from withtlsshtlittg its rae'tg stitiett, mach less France and England, that are ~troiigeiioagii to do justice and to care not whom they offend by it. The fear that war with the North would result front such action to both grauedlcss and unsvorthy. In time first place, there would he no rttstis haiti by time law of nations in the second, the Northern Stairs would have tent much to do to remodel their own Union and pay the eapeuses of their separation from the South to have time or heart for a war in which the whole world would be against theist ; and, in the third play, there is a large and inihiential psity in the United States who, instead of dt1tro
eating such friendly intervention on the pact of Europe, would look upon its refusal as the greatest calamity that could befall the North, and the ouklndoat possible pulley that Europe could pursue towards it. Southern independence is no longer a dream, but a fact; and, in juietica to all patties, it ought to be acknowledged, as much for il*ske of the North as for that of be South, and as much for the sake-of the soltea'iog industry rf Great Britain and Frilnee as for that of both of the combatants.

"News of an hour's age sloth hiss the speaker" when he speaks American news. While English writers are commenting upon the gallant deeds of the South and considering the life of Creaewell for the illustration of that of Jackson, they are sod. deoly coiled upon to poal;paeeo their historical parallels and to record that at length General MOlellan, aroused to a sense of the value of time, line marched rapidly to coast the invaders. has closed with them, and, after some battles of extraordinary savageness, has driven iheno hook-how far it is not known, but it is cortainthat the invasionhas been for the time repelled. M'Olollase has not only repulsed the Confederates but has vindicated his own character and the confidence which was placed in him by the army which he 010(10; and, without reference to the straggle itself, those in England who have all along rebuked the ingratitude with which his early and patient services were requited, and who felt a kind of impatient pity or a Populace that preferred the vaunt and swagger of each leeelere as Pope to the steady perseverance of MClellan, are glad to have an opportunity of once more doing bloc the justice which his countrymen were inclined to refuse him. Another snail may place hint in a situation of another kind; hot the educated and conscientious officer has now shown the Union the difference between a real soldier, in the hour of need, and the vain "selfmade" Generals who have been thrown to the front by a score of influences with which professional. fitness has had nothing to do. We learn that in Kentucky an important advantage has been gained by the Confederates, and that a very extensive capture of prisoners has been made, and also that the retreat of the invading army was conducted with perfect order, although, of course, it was necessary to flavour the telegrams with scumdonal polysyllables for the public of Now York.

ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.

on Special Artist in America has sent to us an Bluetration, which we give moths preceding page, showing the Confederate scooting party under General Stuart, akiuniebing with a portion of General Pope's army in the neighbourhood of Oulpepper Courthouse. General

'sfame reached England after his marvellous raid round the extreme right of M'Clellan'a army, whilst the latter was threatening Richmond. It is

necessary to remind our readers of this gallant dash, which will take its picas in the history of cavalry tactics. Probably many will be surprised at the rough aol worn appearance of the men, especially when they are told that many of the privates worth from 50,000 to 100,000 dollars each. The rudeness of their eqiipmente, consisting mainly of old rusty eabrcs and shot-guns, is in ft great degree owing to the blockade, which shuts them out of the market of good carbines and doe-tempered blades. As it is, they are the finest irregular body of horse in the world.
