<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">CONFEDERATE INVASION OF THE
NORTH.</hi></p>
<p>The rumours which had for some time been current that General Lee's
army was about to act on the offensive were, it turns out, well
founded. The Confederate General has advanced with great rapidity
northwards, pushing a portion of his troops, consisting of cavalry and
mounted infantry, far forward, so as actually to enter the State of
Pennsylvania. General Lee's advance commenced on Saturday, the 18th
ult., and the total force with which he is making his combinations is
estimated to be but a little short of 100,000 men, of whom 30,000 are
said to be cavalry. They were divided into three bodies and seem to
have made but slight work of the opposition that was offered to their
advance.  At Winchester, General Milroy attempted to arrest their
progress, but the outworks which he had constructed were stormed, and,
after spiking his guns, he retired upon Harper's Ferry. An attempt was
made to cut off his retreat, but this he seems to have
surmounted with a loss of 2000 men, and eventually made good his way
to Harper's Ferry, to which point the Federals at Martinsburg and
Berryville also made their way in retreat. At one time, Harper's Ferry
was abandoned but the Federals have resumed possession of it. All this
was on the Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday morning the Confederates
had crossed the Potomac, and were at Hagerstown, in Maryland, with a large force, of which it was said 15,000 were
cavalry, divided into three columns of 5000 men each. On the
Tuesday they advanced to Greencastle, and then to Chambersburg, in
Pennsylvania, where, according to one report, a force of 2000
Confederates rested at twelve o'clock that night. The Nova Scotian
brings a few hours' later news to the evening of June 20, to the
effect that the Confederates had advanced to Centreville and defeated
the Federals there. Longstreet was threatening Leesburg, and Hill was
at Dumfries. On Thursday night, the 18th, the Confederates transported
their stores across the Potomac to Hagerstown, and it was said that
they intended to make it their headquarters for raids into
Pennsylvania. One important rumour is mentioned in the news brought by
the Nova Scotian. It is that the Unionists in Eastern Tennessee and
Western North Carolina had raised a powerful force to hold that region
against the Confederates.</p>
<p>At Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, distant but fifty miles
from Chambersburg, there was naturally consternation, and the State
archives and all public property of value were removed. The Governor
issued his call for troops for State defence, and the President united
in this by summoning 100,000 men to be mustered into the military
service of the United States to serve for six months. Of these, 50,000
are called for from Pennsylvania, 30,000 from Ohio, and 10,000 from
Maryland and West Virginia respectively. The volunteering for a short
period has been generally warmly supported, but in Pennsylvania it has
been necessary to assure the men that they were only called up to
resist invasion. New York has raised fourteen regiments in four days
for service in Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg and Pittsburg have both
been strongly fortified.</p>
<p>Hooker meanwhile has abandoned his position opposite
Fredericksburg, and is moving on a line parallel with that Lee has taken
northwards. His base at Acquia Creek is also abandoned, and his
supplies have been removed to Alexandria, his new base. At Warrenton,
about the same distance from Washington as Fredericksburg, a little
west of north of the latter place, he has his headquarters. Lee is
supposed to be at Front Royal, twenty-five miles north-west of
Warrenton.</p>
<p>It is a moment as critical as any in the war. As to Lee's plans
nothing, of course, is known--whether he will turn towards Western
Pennsylvania, supposing he eludes Hooker's main forces, or whether he
will direct his way eastward towards Baltimore or Philadelphia. Hooker
divined the intention of his adversary to make this advance, and had
for some time held his forces in instant readiness to follow. The
Government, too, made such preparation as they could by creating two
military departments for East and West  Pennsylvania and appointing
officers of high rank to command.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Richmond Threatened.</hi></p>
<p>On the Yorktown peninsula there are signs of Federal activity, as
we learn from Richmond accounts. The Federal gunboats have pushed up
the Chickahominy, within fifty miles of Richmond, and	a considerable
force is co-operating with them. General Keyes's command, which has
for some time been posted at West Point, has lately advanced to New
Kent Courthouse, about forty miles from the Virginian capital, and, in
face of those demonstrations, the Confederates have retired behind the
Chickahominy. It is said that Richmond is very strongly defended and
fully garrisoned.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Vicksburg.</hi></p>
<p>From Vicksburg we have news to the 18th ult., at which time affairs
were, according to Northern accounts, favourable to General Grant. The
Federals had pushed their approach within twenty yards of the bastion,
whilst Pemberton is said to receive reinforcements and supplies,
during the night, from the other side of the Mississippi. The Federals
yet hold possession of Black River Bridge, and their opponents are
declared to be at least thirty miles from the rear of Grant. One
despatch stations a body of Confederates, to the number of 5000, at
Jackson; another of 5000 at Yazoo City; and a third of 15,000 at
Canton. The Richmond papers state that General Johnstone had cut his
way through Grant's army, and that the siege would in consequence be
raised. This report, however, was not credited. The besieged appear to
be reduced to short rations.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General News.</hi></p>
<p>In Tennessee there are said to be signs of Confederate
movement. Contrary to the general opinion, Bragg has been reinforced,
whence is not stated, but he is believed to be about joining with
Buckner to invade Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Indiana enrolment excitement continues. A general
disinclination to submit to the draught is apparent all over the
country.</p>
<p>A military board has been appointed to settle this claims of
Generals Butler, Fremont, M'Clellan, Banks, and Dix for military
precedence of rank.</p>
<p>President Lincoln had sent a reply to the committee who forwarded
him the resolutions passed at the Albany Vallandigham meeting. The
President says that the ordinary law courts are inadequate to the
emergency. He continues:--" Military arrests and the suspension of the
Habeas Corpus Act are constitutional wherever public safety demands
it. Mr. Vallandigham was arrested by the military because he was
warring against the military, by labouring to prevent the raising of
troops and encouraging desertion." President Lincoln states that he
does not know whether, in his own discretion, he would have arrested
Mr. Vallandigham, but he thinks commanders in the field better judges
of particular cases. He will discharge Mr. Vallandigham as soon as he
can by any means believe that public safety will not suffer by it.</p>
<p>There are now about 30,000 coloured troops in the Federal army and
5000 coloured men in the Federal navy.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says:--"Since July,
1862, 57 steamers and 91 sailing-vessels left Nassau for the rebel
ports. Fifty-one of the former and 45 of the latter landed their
cargoes, affording immense aid to the rebels and realising vast sums
for the speculators. Forty-four steamers and 45 sailing-vessels
reached Nassau from the Confederacy during the same period."</p>
<p>The privateer Clarence, the tender of the Florida, has captured
seven brigs and schooners off Virginia Cape. The captain of the
Clarence transferred his guns to the barque Saxony, which he had
captured, and burned the Clarence. Twenty-five Federal vessels have
left Northern ports to capture the Saxony and the Coquette. The
privateer Japan has captured the ship Dictator.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>In answer to Lord Stratheden, Earl Russell said the French Ambassador had
called upon him that afternoon, and informed him that there was no truth in
the rumour that the French Government intended to make any communication
to her Majesty's Government in reference to mediation between the
Northern and Southern States of America.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. Layard, in reply to Mr. Foster, stated that no communication
had been received tram the French Government since last autumn in
reference to interference in the American war.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Proposed Recognition of the
Confederate States.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Roebuck</hi> moved an address to the Crown,
praying that her Majesty would be graciously pleased to enter into
negotiations with the great Powers of Europe for the purpose of
obtaining their co-operation in the recognition of the independence of
the Confederate States of North America. He contended that the South,
by their gallant defence, and even by their victory over the North,
had earned a right to a recognition of their independence, and this on
every ground of international polity. Those States ought to be
acknowledged by England because it was their right, and also because
it was to the interest of England to do so in reference to the supply
of cotton, sugar, and tobacco to this country. The United States were
becoming the bullies of the world, and he would rejoice to see the
balance of power equalised on the American continent by the
reconstruction of the Union. He urged that the time had come for recognition by France and England, which
would put an end to the war. He stated that he was personally
authorised by the ruler of France to express his feelings on this
question, which were stronger than ever in favour of recognition of
the South; and he was assured by the Emperor himself that he had
desired Baron Gros to communicate that opinion to the English
Government, although this communication was not formal.	The Emperor
stated his reason for not making a formal communication, because his
despatch on the same subject on a former occasion had been sent by the English Government to the United States; but
he authorised him, (Mr. Roebuck) to state to the House that he was
prepared to act in all things with England, and especially in the
matter of the recognition of the Southern States. After this, what
excuse could be made by her Majesty's Government for not taking that
step?</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcap">B. Montagu</hi> moved as an amendment that the House earnestly desires
that an impartial neutrality should continue to be maintained by her
Majesty's Government during the present unhappy contest in the States
of North America.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Clifford</hi> supported the amendment.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcap">Chancellor</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcap">Exechquer</hi> objected to the motion in the first
place because it put into the hands of the House a function of the
executive Government; because it was at this moment especially
inconvenient, looking to the military situation of America while the
speech of Mr. Roebuck, couched as it was in a spirit of partisanship
for the South, was ill calculated to promote the object he had in
view. Recognition would not relieve Lancashire, and it was ill-advised
to lay down that as a doctrine when it was clear that this country, to
produce such results as were implied by Mr. Roebuck, could not stop at
recognition. Almost every man in England wished the war to come to a
close, but he denied that recognition would promote that end. There
was scarcely any case of recognition, pending a contest, which was not
followed by war in order to carry it cut. He contended that France and
England, situated as they were in reference to the States of America,
could not represent in the eyes of the world the principle of
impartiality in any interference between the contending parties.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">W. E. Forster</hi> urged that the motion,
if it meant anything, meant war--war to be waged for selfish
consideration; war which would be producttve of every possible
disaster to the commerce and the welfare of this country. In reference
to Mr. Roebuck's alleged communication to the House from the Emperor
of the French, he (Mr. Forster) deprecated the policy of joint action
with France, which inevitably led to war. A war with America, which
might and probably would ensue upon our intervention, would be one
against our kinsmen for slavery.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcap">R. Cecil</hi> argued that the conduct of the United States in cases of
recognition precluded them from objecting to the adoption of that course; and
he urged action in reference to the re-establishment of peace in the interests of
a large population of our own, which was desolate, owing to the failure of the
cotton supply.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Bright</hi> said that the motion, taken in
connection with Mr. Roebuck's character, his speech on this occasion,
and speeches elsewhere, might be taken as an address to the Crown
asking for a declaration of war, while he asked the House to accept
the lead of the Emperor of the French in this matter, a potentate in
whom not long ago he declared he had no faith. He contended that the
feeling which dictated this motion rested on a mean jealousy or a base
fear of America. He denied the power or the will of the United States
to act aggressively towards England or any other European nation, and
he protested against Mr. Roebuck raising a cry calculated to bring on
hostilities, between this country and a friendly nation, whilst he
would seek alliance for his country in a slaveholding State.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcap">G. Grey</hi>, in reference to a statement
by Mr. Roebuck of the readiness of the Emperor of the French to act in
conjunction with this country for the recognition of the South, stated
that no communication whatever on that point had been made to her
Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>The debate was adjourned to Thursday.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AMERICA.</hi>--Mr. W. E. Forster asked
Mr. Layard whether he could inform the House if it was true that
application was made some months ago that France should join England
in mediation between the Federal and Confederate States of
America.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Layard</hi> denied the statements
made by Mr. Roebuck on a former evening, and said that no
communication had been made by Lord Lyons to Mr. Seward on the
subject.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate Invasion Of The
North.</hi></p>
<p>We have reports-not, however, very precise--of the movements of General
Lee to the 27th ult. This much seems certain, that a large portion
of the Confederate forces had passed into Pennsylvania and
Maryland, and that General Lee was endeavouring to isolate
Washington from the north and east as well as from the west. Thus far
General Lee has been enabled to carry out his plans without receiving
any material check. One division of General Lee's army is said to be
advancing to Budd's Ferry, fifteen miles below Washington, where,
with the aid of the pontoons the Confederates have carried with them,
the passage of the Potomac can, it is stated, easily be effected. This
division would probably march upon Fort Washington and re-establish
the batteries which formerly commanded the Lower Potomac and affected
the sea communications of the Federals. Another body of Confederates
first proceeded to Martinsburg, a town distant only a few miles from
Harper's Ferry, and thence they proceeded along the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad as far west as Cumberland, a part of Maryland which almost
unites Pennsylvania and Virginia, and is at the same time brought
near to Ohio by the great railway system of the Middle and Western
States. According to the Baltimore correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> General Lee was in strong force at Frederick City, Maryland, on
the 25th of June, and thence would either move on Washington or
Baltimore, or pass to the railroad between Washington and
Baltimore. General Hooker was also moving, and the right wing of his
army was said to be at Hagerstown.</p>
<p>So imminent is the peril that is supposed to menace Baltimore that the most urgent appeals are made to
the people by the Government, the Mayor of the city, the councils of
the military authorities, and the newspapers, to turn out to work on
the intrenchments which are being hastily erected for the defence of
the city, and to enlist in the various military organisations.</p>
<p>The despatches complain that there is universal indifference among the
people of Pennsylvania regarding the invasion. The <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that "the inhabitants seem to
have lost all spirit, and either retreat rapidly at the approach of
the Confederates or exhibit a strange apathy. Even the troops from New York or New Jersey are
not received with cordiality or enthusiasm, but the inhabitants
endeavour only to profit pecuniarily by their presence."</p>
<p>Immense mischief seems to have been done to the Northern cause by the
defeat and retreat of General Milroy from Winchester, that key of
the Shenandoah Valley which has so often changed owners during the
last three years. The Southerners claim to have captured from
Milroy 6500 prisoners, 2800 horses, 500 waggons, and stores to the
value of 2,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>The Washington correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> gives the following summary of the Confederate strength
and movements:--</p>
<p><q>General Lee, for a week previous to moving from Culpepper in his last mysterious movement, gave orders, which
were stringently enforced, that no person, soldier or citizen, should
be allowed to enter or leave his lines. It is said that his army 
commenced to move on Saturday, and continued to pass through
Culpepper during all the intervening period up to Thursday of the
succeeding week. His force is said to have consisted of Ewell's corps
of 35,000 men, who marched out first, Longstreet's corps of 42,000
men, and Hill's corps of 28,000 men, who brought up the rear. General
Stuart's cavalry, 18,000 strong, protected the flank and rear,
while Jenkins, with 3000 men, accompanied Ewell into Maryland, the
destination of the main portion of the army. The artillery is said to
be in superb condition and very numerous. Stuart's command is said
to consist of six divisions of two brigades each, three regiments to
a brigade, and 500 men the average maximum number to a regiment. The
4th Virginia, the largest of all, on a recent review, numbered 714,
but every man that could be obtained was present on this
occasion.</q></p>
<p>The following are other fragments of news telegraphed on the dates
given:--</p>
<p><q>New York, June 26.--The Confederates under General Jones, with
cavalry and artillery, have, after a severe skirmish, driven the Federals
under Milroy out of Macconnellsburg and occupied that place. The
Federals have evacuated Carlisle, and fallen back to Harrisburg. The
Confederate advance in Pennsylvania is said to be 10,000 strong. The
Governor of Pennsylvania has called for 50,000 militia for
defence for three months. The Governor of Illinois has offered
10,000 men to resist the invasion.</q></p>
<p><q>June 27, Morning.-General Ewell entered Chambersburg on Wednesday, and isused on order forbidding
the inhabitants to sell liquor to the soldiers; also admonishing
persons not in military service to abstain from acts of hostility,
stating that acquiescence in the demands of the military authorities
would lessen the rigours of war. General Ewell's main force is
believed to have halted in the rear of Chambersburg, holding
all the roads and passes in the vicinity, and awaiting
reinforcements. General Early's division of Longstreet's corps,
consisting of ten regiments of infantry, with cavalry and artillery,
occupied Gettysburg yesterday.  It is supposed that General Early
will strike the Northern Central Railroad at Hanover Junction or
Fork, thirty miles distant.</q></p><pb n="27"/>
<p><q>The Confederates hold all the passes of South Mountain. They are
also in close proximity to Carlisle, but have not yet occupied the
place. The Federal General Smith commands the defences of the
Susquehannah. Colonel Pierce supersedes General Milroy at Bloody
Run. General Dana commands the defences of Philadelphia. The <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that two days ago half General
Lee's army was in Maryland and Pennsylvania; the other half,
immediately under the eye of Lee, was thirty miles south of the
Potomac, in the Shenandoah Valley. General Lee's whole army may be
described, in a military sense, as being in the same valley extending
thirty miles from Winchester to the Potomac, and thence fifty miles
northward to Chambersburg. The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>
does not anticipate a collision between Generals Lee and Hooker for
several days, and says--"It is probable that the first serious
hostilities will take place at Harper's Ferry, for that point, with
Lee's advance beyond the Potomac, is essential to Lee's communication
with the Shenandoah Valley and Richmond. Lee's siege trains will,
therefore, probably be first used against the Maryland Heights, in
conjunction with an assault by the reserved column of General
Longstreet."</q></p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General War News.</hi></p>
<p>Vicksburg still defies the attempts of General Grant, and the
Confederates have entire possession of Milliken's Bend, above the
city. Telegrams published in the <hi rend="italic">Richmond
Despatch</hi> state that a desperate fight took place at Port Hudson
on the 12th ult. The Confederates left their fortifications, charged
upon the Federals, drove them from their intrenchments, and spiked
their siege guns. Northern despatches add that General Banks ordered
an assault on the place at daylight on the 14th, and at eleven o'clock
on the same morning retreated to his intrenchments, having been
disastrously repulsed at all points, with the loss of 700 to 1000
men. [This attack is fully described in another column.] It was
supposed that another assault would be made on the 17th ult., Colonel
Dudley having volunteered to lead a storming column of 4000 picked
men. The Confederates were reported to be concentrating in General
Banks's rear to prevent his retreat to Baton Rouge. General Johnston
continues to accumulate troops on the eastern side of the Big Black
River, and, according to the latest accounts, some skirmishing had
taken place between the Confederate cavalry and the outposts of the
Federal army at the bridge by which this river is crossed by the
Vicksburg and Jackson Railway.</p>
<p>A body of negro troops under Colonel Montgomery has pillaged and
burned the town of Darien, in Georgia; and a body of 1000 Texans has
been repulsed at Lake Providence by negro troops.</p>
<p>Confederate General Jackson commands the department of East
Tennessee, and has under him General Pegram, with 8000 to 10,000 men,
which, together with the force in the Cumberland Gap region, is
expected to move into Kentucky. Colonel Saunders, recently sent by
General Burnside upon a bridge-burning expedition into Eastern
Tennessee, returned to Boston, Kentucky, on the 23rd. He reports that
he destroyed three important bridges on the East Tennessee and
Virginia Railway and great quantities of stores; also, that he
captured 500 prisoners, three pieces of artillery, 200 cases of
ammunition, and 1000 stand of small arms.</p>
<p>Richmond is defended by the corps of D. H. Hill, 21,000 strong, on
the south side; by Major-General French on the north, or near the
city, with about 17,000 men; while the heavy brigade, under General
Wise, is on the York River Railroad. General Corse, with two brigades,
occupies Hanover Junction, assisted by 3500 mounted Texans taken
prisoners at Arkansas Port and exchanged. This force is to be drawn
close around and concentrated near the capital in case the Federal
army should advance.</p>
<p>The Confederates have lost two of their ironclads, one was captured
by the Federals at Savannah, and the other blew up in the Apalachicola
River. Several steamers had been sunk by the blockading squadron at
Charleston, and it is announced that hereafter the squadron will sink
all blockade runners. Sixteen Mobile adventurers have captured the
Federal steamer Boston at the mouth of the Mississippi, afterwards
burning two barques, and taking the steamer into Mobile. The
Confederate iron-clad steamer Atlanta, formerly the Finlay, steamed
out of Savannah and was captured by two Federal ironclads, after
thirty minutes' fighting. The Confederate cruisers are growing more
daring. At the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, and in that neighbourhood,
they had destroyed numerous Federal vessels. Admiral Dahlgren will
succeed Admiral Dupont in the command of the South Atlantic
squadron. Mr. Vallandigham has run the blockade in a vessel bound to
Nassau.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAST ASSAULT ON PORT HUDSON.</p>
<p rend="center">The Correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi>, writing from Port Hudson, June 17, gives a long account of Banks's assault on Sunday,
the 14th, which proved very disastrous to the attacking force.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Federal Position.</hi></p>
<p>Since the previous assault the position had been somewhat
changed. We now have no centre, but only a right and left, which,
joined together forms nearly a right angle, completely inclosing the
rebel stronghold on the east bank of the river. General Grover's
division is now on the upper side of Port Hudson, extending a distance
of nearly four miles from the river to the interior, to a point within
supporting distance of General Auger's division, which is on the west
side of the rebel fortifications, and extends a distance of about
three miles in the direction of the river to within hailing distance
of our fleet.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate
Position.</hi></p>
<p>Before proceeding to give the detail, the correspondent gives the
following account of the rebel position derived from observations
"from a high tree within less than one hundred rods of the first line
of rebel defences":--</p>
<p>Looking from the extreme north-easterly range of rebel rifle-pits
towards the river on the upper side of Port Hudson, a long line of
earthworks can be seen glistening with bayonets and protected by a
ditch nearly 12ft. in width, and, for the purpose for which it was
built, unusually deep. Within short musket range enfilading
breastworks command every possible approach to the enemy's
position.</p>
<p>As I have before indicated in speaking of the conjunction of our
right and left, the rebel defences form nearly a right angle, both the
lines of which extend to the river, inclosing a sharp bend in the
stream, by which our gunboats found it so difficult to pass. The most
accessible approach apparently to the rebel earthworks is over a clear
field about 600 yards in width, and which, at first sight, presents
the appearance of an almost perfect level. This spot, however, since
our last assault has been determined to be, although the most
inviting, the most treacherous, place along the entire line of rebel
defences. Our soldiers in their charge found it to be filled with
deep, narrow gullies, too small to cover a large body of troops, and
too large to make a passage over them, even for infantry, barely
possible. Horses are out of the question, and were not used at this
point. These artificial ravines are completely covered with fallen
trees and vines, which are so arranged as to nearly obscure them from
sight, and make an advance over them a matter of extreme
difficulty. In our charge upon the enemy's lines at this spot it was
impossible for our soldiers to keep in regular order of
bottle. Frequently whole squads of men would sink out of sight, only
to be rescued by the assistance of their comrades. Down the right line
of the enemy's works all approach to the fortifications is made
exceedingly difficult by high bluffs and deep irregular gullies. The
enemy's rifle-pits are, although bearing the appearance of very wide
constructions, built upon the most approved modern engineering
skill. Here again fallen trees have been so arranged as to make it
impossible to move artillery or troops in line of battle. The entire
distance of rebel works presented for our reduction are nearly eight
miles in extent.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">THE PLAN OF ATTACK.</hi></p>
<p>Last Saturday evening the order of attack was determined upon at
headquarters, and communicated to the Generals who were to command the
assaulting columns.</p>
<p>The point of attack was the extreme north-easterly angle of the
enemy's breastworks, and the plan of the assault was briefly as
follows:--The 75th New York, under command of Captain Cray, and the
12th Connecticut, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Peck, were detailed as
skirmishers, forming a separate command under Lieutenant-Colonel
Babcock, of the 74th New York. The 91st New York, Colonel Van Zandt
commanding--each soldier carrying a five-pound hand-grenade, with his
musket thrown over his shoulder--followed next in order. The
skirmishers were to creep up and lie on the exterior slope of the
enemy's breastworks, while the regiment carrying the grenades were to
come up to the same position and throw over their grenades into the
enemy's lines, with a view to rout them and drive them from behind
their works. The 24th Connecticut, Colonel Mansfield, with their arms
in like manner to the grenade regiment, followed, carrying sandbags
filled with cotton, which were to be used to fill up the ditch in
front of the enemy's breastworks, to enable the assaulting party the
more easily to scale them and charge upon the rebels. Following these
regiments came, properly speaking, the balance of General Weitzel's
whole brigade, under the command of Colonel Smith, of the 114th New
York. Next came Colonel Kimble's and Colonel Morgan's brigades, the
last of which, with another brigade, was under the general command of
Colonel Birge. This force was held to support the assaulting column,
which was under the immediate command of General Weitzel, who made the
attack on the right. General Emory's old division moved in conjunction
with General Weitzel on the left, forming a separate column. The two
divisions (General Weitzel's and General Paine's) were under the
command of General Grover, who planned the assault under General
Banks's order. General Weitzel's division was expected to make a
lodgment inside the enemy's works, and in that manner prepare the way
for General Paine's division. After the inside of the enemy's
fortifications had been reached skirmishers were to push forward and
clear the way, while both columns were to be deployed in line of
battle, and move towards the town of Port Hudson, where a grand
citadel, which forms the last means of rebel defence, is situated.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Attack Commenced.</hi></p>
<p>About daylight the 75th New York, which had been slowly advancing
approached the enemy's works sufficiently near to see his
fire. Previously the columns of the main body of General Grover's
command were formed in the woods skirting the enemy's breastworks. The
12th Connecticut, during the night, had lost its way in the woods, and
the 91st New York was ordered by General Weitzel to take the place
that had been assigned to it, and follow immediately in the rear of
the 75th New York. After the advance of the 75th and 91st Regiments,
General Weitzel's entire command commenced moving forward. Several
days previous our army engineers had been preparing a covered way,
which extended from the woods where our troops lay to within about one
hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's position. Through this covered
way our troops marched in single file up to the point when the first
line of battle was formed. The covered way was relied upon as being
sufficiently deep to afford protection to our soldiers; but it turned
out to be of no considerable consequence, owing to some fault in its
construction. After the advance had arrived at the end of the covered
way, they began slowly to push over the innumerable barriers that had
been planted by the rebels to obstruct their march. The difficulties I
have before spoken of concerning the open field immediately facing the
enemy's works were here experienced. The deep gullies covered over by
brush and creeping vines were completely obscured from sight, and were
only known to exist after our soldiers had plunged into them. Part of
our skirmishers deployed to the right while suffering severely from
the enemy's fire, and a portion of the advance took up a position on
the left of the point to be attacked. They were immediately followed
by General Weitzel's column. General Paine in the meantime advaced
towards the enemy's works with his command further on the left. Our
troops, as soon as they had left the cover of the woods, which were
scarcely 300 yards from the enemy's breastworks, were subject to the
constant fire of the rebel infantry. A portion of our artillery, which
was planted some distance in the rear of our advancing forces, kept up
a continuous fire on the rebel works, and served very much to protect
our troops as they were advancing to the attack.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Attack.</hi></p>
<p>After our skirmishers had picked their way up to within about
thirty yards of the enemy's works they sprang into the ditch,
expecting to be able to shelter themselves under the cover of the
rebel fortifications, and keep the enemy down while the regiment, with
the hand-grenades, should advance and perform their part of the work
in driving the rebels from their position. The portion of the 75th
which succeeded in reaching the ditch were immediately repulsed, and
nearly all of them were killed or wounded. The ditch was so enfiladed
that it was impossible for men to live under the murderous fire of the
enemy.</p>
<p>In consequence of the repulse of the portion of the 75th that
succeeded in reaching the ditch the hand-grenades could accomplish but
little. In fact, although they made many desperate but gallant
attempts to be of service, they rather damaged than benefited our
chances of success, for, as they threw their grenades over the rebel
breastworks, the rebels actually caught them and hurled them back upon
us. In the meantime, while the skirmishers were nobly endeavouring to
sustain themselves in their position, Weitzel's column moved up as
rapidly as possible, and made a series of desperate assaults on the
enemy's works, for which, for bravery and daring, the history of war
can hardly furnish a parallel. At this time, the sun having fairly
risen, the fight became general; a fog, which had partially obscured
the contending armies, lifted, and revealed their respective
positions. The enemy were fully prepared for us, and they lined every
part of their fortifications with heavy bodies of infantry. The battle
had begun in earnest, and General Paine's column as well as General
Weitzel's was actively engaged. Under the general plan of attack, as
directed by General Banks, Generals Augur and Dwight were to make
feints on the extreme left of General Grover's position, to distract
the attention of the enemy from the main assault. Accordingly, before
the engagement became general between General Grover's command and the
enemy, Generals Augur and Dwight had attacked the enemy.</p>
<p rend=center"><hi rend="smallcap">THE Repulse.</hi></p>
<p>The fight, however, though only intended at a feint, was, on the
part of General Dwight's command, exceedingly severe, and scarcely
less so with General Grover's. General Dwight's loss in killed and
wounded will probably exceed two hundred. General Augur's loss will
fall considerably short of that number. Under General Grover's
command, probably the most desperate fighting was done by General
Weitzel's old brigade. Colonel Smith, leading these veterans, fell
early in the action, mortally wounded. The charges made on the rebel
works by our brave soldiers showed a determination to carry then at
all hazards; but human bravery on this occasion was not adequate to
the accomplishment of their object. The most formidable obstacle that
presented itself as a barrier to our success was the rebel glacis,
which at the point attacked had been constructed in such a manner as
to make every bullet tell that was fired from the rebel breast works
while our troops were endeavouring to make the ascent. In fact, the
real natural advantages and engineering ability at Port Hudson have
been rather under than over rated. Immediately upon the fall of
Colonel Smith, Lieut.-Colonel Von Petten, of the 160th New York, took
command of the brigade, and gallantly led the charge until all further
hope of driving the rebels from their position was gone. Brigade after
brigade followed in rapid succession, storming the rebel works until
compelled to fall back with great slaughter under the terrible fire of
the enemy.</p>
<p>The fighing ceased at eleven o'clock in the morning. We having
been repulsed in every assault, our soldiers, under command of their
officers, laid themselves down under the shelter of the gullies,
trees, covered way--in fact, everything that could afford them
protection--and waited for the day to pass and darkness come on. Many
of our wounded who were accessible were carried from the field by
squads detailed for that purpose. It is a shameful reflection on
humanity that a large number of our soldiers, carrying the wounded and
dying from the field on stretchers, were shot down by the enemy, and
in several instances the wounded were killed while being borne from
the field. At nightfall, however, we commenced the burial of our dead,
and succeeded before the morning in carrying most of our wounded from
the battleground.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Losses.</hi></p>
<p>I have no time to give you further details, as we have not yet
entirely recovered from the confusion at the battle, and a courier is
about leaving with despatches. Our total loss, however, in this last
attack upon Port Hudson, will probably not fall much short of 1000. It
is rumoured, just as I am closing this letter, that we are to attack
the enemy again to-night.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SIEGE OF VICKSBURG.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> a contest conducted upon so stupendous
a scale as the war now waging between the rival Confederacies of
America it must often happen that operations of the greatest import to
those concerned in them, and to the ultimate issue of the struggle
become for a time neglected in the interest excited by still more
stirring events occurring elsewhere. Thus, while with the keenest
interest we were following the army of the Potomac, as, broken and
breathless, it recrossed the Rappahannock after its last advance on
Richmond, our attention was diverted to the masterly and successful
march of General Grant to the very threshold of Vicksburg. And, again,
while we were looking anxiously for news which should tell that the
fall of this city of the Mississippi had rewarded the efforts of the
one Federal General who seems to combine skill in action with boldness
at the council-table, or that the Confederates had succeeded in
raising the siege, we are diverted by the intelligence of Lee's
invasion of the North; and the fate of Vicksburg, which at one time
seemed likely even to influence the issue of the war, becomes at once
of secondary importance. Satisfied, however, that before long the
operations having for their object the possession of the Mississippi
will once again assume the importance which they deserve, we do not
hesitate, while we are busy preparing a map that shall illustrate
General Lee's present movements, to lay before our readers a plan of
Vicksburg which may explain the operations by which General Grant
brought his forces to the gates of the town, and help them to
comprehend the news which any mail may bring of further events
affecting his position.</p>
<p>Before relating the movemem±s of the opposing armies a short
space may advantageously be devoted to a description of the arena to
which their struggles have been confined. We will ask our readers,
then, to imagine a wide, deep canal 1000 miles long, extending from,
say Birmingham, through France and Austria, to the Black Sea. Let them
further fancy England at war with France, Austria, and the Swiss
Confederacy for the possession of such a canal, and picture upon the
map of Europe, which it would intersect, two powerful fortified
positions upon bluffs overlooking and commanding its passage, situated
say in the heart of France and garrisoned by French soldiers. Such a
condition represents fairly the Mississippi River, having Pittsburg,
the Federal Birmingham, on one of its branches, running for 1000 miles
through hostile peoples with its free navigation which is one great
object of the Federal party to secure, impeded by the strong positions
of Vicksburg and Port Hudson. To gain this end, and acquire the free
navigation of this noble river, no sacrifice of life and means has
been spared by the North.</p>
<p>To begin with, it will be remembered that Columbus, Island No. 10,
Memphis, New Orleans, and Baton Rouge were all taken at a great
outlay, of men, money, and material of war. So much being secured, it
was projected to render the position of Vicksburg harmless by cutting
an enormous canal into which the water of the Mississippi might be
diverted and Vicksburg avoided. The work was begun, and a cutting made
across the heel of the horse-shoe bend of the river indicated in our
Map. The work was completed, the river rose and fell, but the
Mississippi refused to accommodate itself to the new channel prepared
for its waters, and remained obstinately "secesh."</p>
<p>General Grant next ordered the Admiral in charge of the Federal
fleet above Vicksburg to force some of his transports and gunboats
past the town at every hazard, and to meet him below the point of
confluence of the Big Black and Mississippi rivers, for the purpose of
conveying his army across the latter river at Grand Gulf. This
movement was effected with remarkable skill and success on the 10th of
May. Several valuable vessels were lost in the attempt, but those that
succeeded in making the passage were quickly repaired, and were found
sufficient to carry out General Grant's purpose. Following up this
success by rapid marches, in pursuance of a singularly strategic plan,
General Grant at once sought the rear of Vicksburg.</p>
<p>He was first met and his way disputed at Thompson's Mill, near
Jackson, by a small body of men under General Bowen. Grant's army
numbered 70,000 men, not all of whom were, however, available for
action in the field. The fleet which he had at his command may fairly
be regarded as a contribution equal to 25,000 more. But it was only
available at such points of his march when he came upon the river,
where it not only furnished him with artillery, but brought him stores
and kept open his long line of supply and, if need were,
retreat. General Bowen had only two brigades under his command. They
fought well; but after contesting his passage for twelve hours, gave
way, and Grant, unable in his haste to give due care to his dead and
wounded, hurried on. The difficulties of his advance, and the
sufferings of his army under a sultry sun, in a tropical climate,
with short supplies and forced marches may easily be imagined. Upon
his way to Jackson he was next met at Raymond, where General Gregg,
with 4000 men, disputed his passage for three hours; and <pb n="28"/>
again, in the vicinity of Jackson, he was held in check by General
Johnson, who fought to gain time, which was spent in sending
provisions into Vicksburg, and by General Pemberton there in
completing the defences of the town.</p>
<p>Jackson having been occupied, Grant moved towards Vicksburg. At the
bridges that crossed the Big Black River he was met, on the 16th of
May by Pemberton with a much inferior force by whom he was fought on
that day and on the next at Big Black River Bridge. General Pemberton
effectually checked Grant's progress; but was compelled to fall back,
in consequence of being outflanked by a division of Grant's army,
thrown across the river higher up, some eight miles. Forced to retire,
and exhausted with the unequal strife, General Pemberton found so much
difficulty in carrying his artillery from the field that he spiked
many pieces, and, having transported his forces over the river, burnt
the bridges behind him. At this time, too, Haines Bluff was abandoned
by the Confederates.</p>
<p>On the 18th of May Grant, having rebuilt the bridges destroyed by
Pemberton, found himself in communication with the Federal fleet upon
the Yazoo River, which had previously been commanded by Haines
Bluff. On the same night General Pemberton, in anticipation of the
strait to which he might soon be reduced, sent from Vicksburg all his
spare horses and mules, which, after many perils, succeeding in
running the gauntlet of the Federal lines. No time was lost, and, on
the 18th, the Federal fleet was directed to shell and bombard the town
from the river, while Grant attempted to carry it by a coup de
main. The assault however, was repulsed with terrible slaughter. In
three other attempts, made with equal gallantry, the Federal troops
met with the same dogged resistance, and were beaten back. In
narrating these events it is difficult to know whether to award the
greater praise to the skill, endurance, and gallantry with which the
Federal army overcame the vast difficulties which lay between the
landing at Grand Gulf and their position before Vicksburg, or the
indomitable gallantry with which the Confederate forces contested
their march and hold them now in check.</p>
<p>But, meanwhile, a cloud somewhat larger than a man's hand gathers
on the rear of Grant's position. General Joseph B. Johnson, known to
be one of the most skilful, experienced, and prudent of the
Confederate chiefs, has been busy collecting an army at Jackson, and
only waits for sufficient artillery to advance upon Grant's
position. Artillery is being conveyed to him as fast as the railroads
can carry it, while General Lee threatens the source of his supplies
from the upper rivers; and, in all probability, before these words are
read, a blow of some decisive kind to one or other of the combatants
will have been struck.</p>
<p>When General Grant advanced on Vicksburg General Banks was directed
to attack Port Hudson, in order to detain at or near that place such
of the Confederate forces as might otherwise be made available for the
relief of Vicksburg. Accordingly, about the 26th of May, General Banks
invested the works at Port Hudson by land and water with an army which was amply provided with the military resources which the Federals possess in such abundance. As in the case of Vicksburg, the fleet poured upon the garrison a continuous
and heavy fire, after which, on the 27th, General Banks ordered the
assault to be made. It was upon this occasion that the experiment was
first tried of using the new levies of negroes, with such dire results
to them, that out of 900 who went under fire but 200 returned
alive. The slaughter of the Federals generally was fearful, as again
and again General Banks threw his gallant and unfortunate army upon
the Confederate lines of defence, until it became but too evident that
the place could only be reduced by the slow operations of a siege.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the relative positions of the combatants upon this
part of the banks of the Mississippi. It would be premature as yet to
speculate upon the news which must soon reach us; but time, which is
all, probably, that the Confederate Generals require to complete the
plans which are in progress to raise the siege of Vicksburg, must be
telling seriously upon the Federal army, operating at a great
distance, from their supplies, in an unhealthy season, and hemmed in
on all sides by watchful guerrillas who lurk about their camps and
along the water-courses. What its present condition is it is
impossible to say; but it has been stated that General Grant's
forces, which on landing at Grand Gulf amounted to 70,000 men,had been
reduced on the way to Vicksburg to 45,000.</p>
<p>The disposition of the Federal forces around Vicksburg are so
plainly indicated in the Map that no verbal description is
necessary. It  will be remembered that during the determined assaults
upon the tower, in the earlier stage of the siege, General Sherman met
his death.</p></div2>

<p>One of the most valuable veins of petroleum yet discovered was
lately struck on the Farrell farm, Old Creek, Verango County,
Pennsylvania. When the well commenced flowing, the oil spouted to a
height of fifty feet, with a roar like a hurricane, and escaping at
the rate of two thousand barrels per day. A stop-cock was got on after
much trouble, and the flow can now be regulated to suit the
demand. Another flowing well in the vicinity was so affected by the
opening of the new well that its yield decreased over three hundred
barrels per day. The Farrell well, which is about 450 ft. deep, was,
at last accounts, flowing steadily at the rate of twelve hundred
barrels a day. This, even at the moderate prices ruling at the wells,
would yield the owners 3600 dols. a day.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Great Battle At Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania.</hi></p> 
<p>An engagement extending over several days has been fought in
Pennsylvania between the picked armies of the rival
federations. According to accounts previously received the Confederate
Commander-in-Chief was reported to be massing his troops on the line
of the Cumberland Valley Railroad, between Chambersburg and Carlisle,
and at the same time the Northern army, under the leadership of its
newly appointed chief, General Meade (General Hooker having
resigned), was known to be advancing by way of Frederick and
Middleburg towards the Pennsylvanian frontier. From this intelligence
it was apparent that the meeting between the two armies could not be
far distant, and that it would probably take place in the confines of
Pennsylvania. Such has proved to be the case. The divisions forming
the advanced columns of the Federal army were met by a subdivision of
the Confederate army on the morning of Wednesday, the lst of July, on
the western side of the small town of Gettysburg. An engagement
followed, which resulted in the defeat of the Federal troops. So far
as we can gather from the telegraphic summary but two divisions of the
Northern army were engaged--one commanded by Reynolds and the other by
Howard. The former, having taken up a position on a wooded ridge to
the west of Gettysburg, was, while thus placed, attacked by the
Confederates. The Federal troops were in the first instance
successful. But after a short time fortune changed sides. The right
wing of the Federals was turned, and when, after two hours' fighting,
Howard came to the aid of Reynolds, he found it impossible to regain
the position on the right which had been taken by the
Confederates. He, however, brought his troops to the front, when
General Ewell came up with a force of 25,000 men, and succeeded in
placing the Federals under a cross fire. Both flanks were then turned,
and the Federal troops retired through Gettysburg after having
sustained considerable loss. The Confederates took possession of the
town, and so terminated the engagement of the 1st of July. It was,
however, but the prelude to a far more terrible one on the succeeding
day. It is described as having been one of the bloodiest battles of
the war, and, even judging from the meagre details which have reached
us, we can readily believe in the justice of the description.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd the main body of the Federal army, under
Meade, joined the divisions which, after the batlle of the preceding
day, had taken up a position to the south of Gettysburg. In the course
of the forenoon of that day Meade arranged his troops far the battle
which he knew to be imminent. His right wing rested on a cemetery to
the south of the town, and was composed of the first and eleventh
corps of his army. The left wing, which was commanded by
Sickles,rested on the crest of a hill, and the battle front of the
army had a north-western aspect. In the afternoon General Sickles made
a reconnoissance in force, which brought his troops into collision
with the Confederates, and shortly afterwards the engagement became
general. The Southern forces rushed to the attack with their usual
impetuosity. On the right the Federals were obliged to retire, but it
was only for a time. They rallied and recovered their previous
position. On the left the Confederates drove their opponents over the
crest of the hill on which they were placed and down the opposite
side. But the left wing of the Federal army, like the right, again
succeeded in regaining its previous position. When the sun set the
battle-field was covered with slain; but relative positions of the two
armies remained unaltered. In the course of the night the Confederates
renewed the engagement, but with little result. At eight o'clock on
the evening of the 3rd the Federal General reported that the
Confederates had opened a heavy fire against his left and centre,
which they maintained for three hours without intermission; and that
subsequently they had twice assaulted the Federal position, but with
ill success. No later intelligence had been received in New York when
the mail left.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> gives some particulars
of Major-General G. S. Meade, promoted to the chief command of the
army of the Potomac, in room of General Hooker, who was relieved from
the command at his own request, being "impressed with the belief that
his usefulness as a commander was impaired":--</p>
<p>"General Meade was born in Spain in 1816; entered the Military
Academy at West Point from the district of Columbia, and was graduated
there in 1839, and appointed second Lieutenant in the 3rd Artillery;
resigned his commission, October 6, 1836; was appointed Second
Lieutenant in the Topographical Engineers, May 19, 1842; was breveted
First Lieutenant for gallantry at Monterey, in 1846; became First
Lieutenant in August, 1851; Captain, May 19, 1856; and
Brigadier-General of Volunteers, August 31, 1861. In June, 1862, he
was promoted to a majority in the Engineer Carps, which rank he still
holds in the newly-organised Engineer Corps of the regular army. Few
officers have performed more arduous duties or rendered more
distinguished and faithful service to the country since the
commencement of the war. In the seven day's fight before Richmond
General Meade was struck by a ball, which entered his side and passed
through his body, making a severe and painful wound. Under tender and skilful
treatment he rapidly recovered, and it was scarcely known that he had
left his couch when he was in his saddle, ready to take part in the
sanguinary battle of South Mountain and Antietam. In these engagements
he commanded the Pennsylvania Reserves--a corps whose reputation for
courage and discipline has been surpassed by none. He was with that
corps in the battles at Drainsville, on the Chickahominy, and in
Maryland. When General Hooker was wounded at Antietam General
M'Clellan placed General Meade in command of the corps which had just
been deprived of its heroic leader. During the action General Meade
received a slight contusion from a spent grapeshot, and had two horses
killed under him. He distinguished himself greatly during the battle,
being in the thickest of the fight, encouraging his men by his deeds
of daring and valour. At Fredericksburg he maintained his reputation
for coolness, courage, and skill, winning the unstinted applause of
the army and the hearty congratulations of a grateful and appreciative
people."</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General War News.</hi></p>
<p>General French has abandoned Maryland Heights destroying all the
fortifications, and has moved to co-operate with General Meade. The
city of Carlisle, a few miles from Harrisburg, had been shelled by a
small Confederate force. Business in Philadelphia is entirely
suspended, and the Pennsylvanian collieries are closed. General Dana
has issued a proclamation stating that the Confederate strategy was
sufficiently understood to make it certain that Philadelphia was
their object, and urging the people to arm for defence. The Mayor of
Philadelphia has called upon the people no longer to close their eyes
to the startling danger and disgrace hanging over the State and
city. The defences of Baltimore are manned by 10,000 citizens, and all
arms have been taken from private persons. Martial law has been
proclaimed in Baltimore and Western Maryland. The Governor of New
Jersey has again called on the militia to go to the aid of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The War Department issued an order on the 28th ult., offering a
bounty of 400 dollars, and one month's pay of thirteen dollars in
advance, to all the volunteers between the ages of eighteen and
forty-five whose term of service has expired or is about to expire,
and who  will re-enlist for three years or the war.</p>
<p>The bridge across the Susquehannah at Columbia, burnt by the
Federals to prevent the Confederate advance, is said to have cost
1,000,000 dollars.</p>
<p>General Dix, who had assumed the command of the Federal army on the
peninsula, had taken possession of White House and sent out a cavalry
force. This force had cut the railway bridge over the South Anna, and
had penetrated to within nine miles of Richmond. They captured several
prisoners, including General Fitzhugh Lee, who was lying ill at a
private house.</p><pb n="59"/>
<p>In Kentucky and Ohio much alarm existed in consequence of the 
advance of Generals Pegram and Marshall, with 15,000 men, through
Cumberland Gap.</p>
<p>In Tennessee General Rosencranz had commenced a forward movement,
and had driven the Confederates to Tullahoma. Bragg's forces had
retreated in a demoralised condition from Tullahoma to Winchester,
leaving behind them a large quantity of provisions and some guns.</p>
<p>The news from the Mississippi is of a doubtful character. The
defenders of Vicksburg are said to be showing great activity, and
General Johnston had advanced to within a short distance of Grant's
army. Johnston is said to have received reinforcements from Bragg, and
to be perfecting arrangements to attack General Grant. The bombardment
of Port Hudson continues. The place, however, was considered
impregnable; and it was believed that the siege would have to be
raised. The Confederate Generals Marmaduke, Price, and Kirby Smith
have got possession of several points along the banks of the
Mississippi, and would probably attempt to seize Milliken's Bend and
obstruct the navigation. The Confederates were very active in the
neighbourhood of New Orleans, which was evidently in jeopardy. In
Louisiana the Confederates were gradually reoccupying the places taken
not long since by the Federals.</p>
<p>President Davis has called upon the Confederates for troops for
home defences, to replace Lee's invading army.</p>
<p>The story of the Tacony and her crew is one of romance. Lieutenant
Read was detailed early in May from the Confederate steamer Florida,
formerly the Oreto, one of the Liverpool built war-steamers, to take
command of the brig Tacony, with an armament of one howitzer and a
crew of about twenty-five men. Sailing close along the northern coast,
he captured and burnt vessel after vessel, many of them of value. He
lured them sometimes to approach him by a signal of distress. The
ravage he committed was great, and a fleet of war-vessels was in
pursuit of him. At length he captured a schooner, which he thought
would better answer his purpose, and, transferring his armament to
her, burned the Tacony. Thus he hoped longer to elude his
pursuers. But a still bolder project occurred to him, the seizure of a
revenue cutter, the Caleb Cushing, which lay in the harbour of
Portland, Maine. He accomplished this owing to a favouring accident on
the night of the 26th ult., and put to sea. The loss of the Cushing
being discovered the following morning, the citizens hastily manned
two steamers, started in pursuit, and succeeded in overtaking
her. After a few shots had been exchanged Lieutenant Read set fire to
the Cushing and returned to the Archer, which was afterwards captured
by the steamers. All the ransom bonds of prizes released by the Tacony
were found on board.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">France</hi> has Mexico. The capital was
virtually won at La Puebla, and the north-western march of the French
was all but unopposed. It is, however, due to the military character
of our gallant neighbours to add that they lost no time in improving
their victory, and hastened to seize points at which a determined
resistance might have been offered with disastrous results to
themselves. They pushed forward with energy, and the Imperial eagle
has dethroned the eagle and serpent. The Sovereigns of the old world
have been somewhat in haste to congratulate the "Parvenu;" but there
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> matter for congratulation in this
success. We have from the outset expressed our conviction that a
French occupation of Mexico must do good--not unalloyed good, it is
true; but the imposition of anything like order and law upon a people
utterly unaccustomed to either cannot fail to lay the seeds of a
civilisation that will bear fruit in good season. We look with neither
real nor affected horror upon the operations of the French in
Mexico. At the very lowest, they are police operations of a salutary
character, but we have hope that they will prove to be something
nobler and better. We therefore hope, also, that the so-called
national party, which could never be consolidated while peaceful and
honest reform was to be done, but which was promptly welded into a
formidable conspiracy against a reformer from abroad, will discover
that further resistance is useless, and will accept the lessons which
the Tuileries schoolmaster has undertaken to teach. Those who see in
this Mexican conquest a tyrannical suppression of the liberties of a
people must have studied to little purpose the disgraceful history of
Mexico for the last quarter of a century. It was time that she should
be taken in hand, and, if the force under General Forey be not
sufficient for the tranquillisation of the region, there is an army in
another famous capital that is eager to get rid of those military
occupants, an army which might very well be transferred from the cause
of brigandage and applied to aid in its suppression.</p>
<p>The Federal Government in North America will probably have
something to say upon the subject of the occupation; and, indeed,
certain of the Northern organs have already been good enough to inform
the Emperor that as soon as the civil war shall have been concluded by
the subjection of the South, he will do well to evacuate Mexico, or
those who have visited it as conquerors may visit it again as
protectors and avengers. Setting aside this somewhat informal
notification, or regarding it as a hint which does not precisely
demand immediate attention, we may be permitted to consider what
effect a different result of the civil war from that indicated by the
New York press will have upon the plans of the Emperor. Now it is due
to that Sovereign to bear in mind that when he has issued a programme he always adverts to it at the close of his campaign,
and points out how far he has been able to carry out his announced
designs, and what he has deemed it wiser to abandon. The Emperor, when
Spain and England withdrew from active co-operation in his designs
upon Mexico, stated that he came for the good of the people, and for
the purpose of enabling the rightminded among them to execute
regenerative operations which had been rendered impossible by the
strife of factions and the absence of national ideas. Passing over the
question whether his Majesty had not supposed that the conquest would
be easier than it turned out to be, and whether he under-estimated the
strength of the hatred which unites robbers against the police, we may
give him credit for having conducted the war with an undaunted rigour,
and in the face of a general and discouraging readiness on the part of
Europe to believe that the campaign was disastrous. He holds Mexico;
but it has cost much. We mean nothing disrespectful in saying that
France is not more ready than England to make sacrifices without
securing some form of reward. It is true that we are usually cheated
the moment we lay by the sword and take to the pen; but we do our
humble best to recoup ourselves the losses we sustain, and France is
generally more fortunate. Now, the Americans, North and South, are out
of court in this matter. We all know what the Union gained by the
Mexican War, and unless American diplomatists have recourse to the Monroe doctrine (incorrectly so termed, by-the-way), and
 declare that European Powers have nothing to say on the soil of the
 New World--a logic against which England has the very best reason to
 protest--it is not for fellow-citizens of the Californians and Texans
 to object upon principle to any concession which a regenerated Mexico
 may make in gratitude to her French regenerator. But supposing that
 the South should establish its claim to recognition, and the rumour
 should be true that a French General has in his portfolio powers to
 publish such recognition in the great square of Mexico on the part of
 France, the relations of the Emperor and of Mr. Davis will take a new
 aspect. Clearly, the sea of Southern gratitude, to use a gracious
 form of words in lieu of a cynical one, will take a distinct form,
 and, between the kindness of the recognised Confederation and of the
 regenerate Mexico the Emperor may find himself obliged to accept the
 reward of his goodness. In plainer terms, a permanent French
 settlement in Mexico may be among the things of the future; perhaps
an incipient Algiers.</p>
<p>As regards the Mexicans themselves, we believe that such a result
of the war would be a benefit. The French are not good colonists, but
they are an admirable police. They, when in earnest to put down
brigands (such brigands not having had their poniards blessed at
St. Peter's) do the work effectually, and, as under the stern old
Romans, "the robber is smothered in his cave or stabbed at its mouth."
But it is with a higher class of ruffianism that France will have to
deal also, and with a fierce system of robbery and jobbery which sends
its agents into Government houses, and works ambidextrously with
proclamations and with pistols. A new organisation will have to be
devised and carried out, and the astounded Mexicans will have to learn
that law does not mean law conditionally on its exponent holding a
long knife; but means a rule to be obeyed silently and punctually by
all people and under all circumstances. We admit that to hope that
this lessonn will be learned in a hurry is a hope in the spirit of the
stage direction in a late wit's proposal to dramatise Lord Macaulay's
History--"Enter St. Augustine: a pause of five-and-twenty minutes
while he converts the Britons to Christianity." But the lesson will
be taught in time. The Arabs of Algeria have at length been made to
comprehend that they are to recover a debt by putting the defendant
into a court and not into a fire.</p>
<p>But as regards England. There is a swarm of little red marks on the
right of the map at North America which indicates that England has an
interest in knowing all about new settlers between 10 deg. and 30
deg. and 60 deg. and 110 deg. Well, we incline to think that should
the Emperor decide on a permanent occupation, we might have a worse
neighbour. We should have an ally, and one who professes, and, as we
believe, with truth, to consider England and France as the natural
leaders of the world, and Powers with whom it would be insanity to
quarrel, when, united, they have the world at their disposal. There is
another reason or two why a French settlement in Mexico would not be
disadvantageous to us, and we think that England will have no cause to
object to the congratulations of our Queen being added to those of the
other Sovereigns.</p></div2>

principally on hearsay; while Mr. Seward had stated that the captain

Government could only rely on the promise of Mr. Seward that in all
cases of this kind strict justice would be done. He had no official

<p>Any one who was so sanguine as to hope that the fratricidal contest
which wages in the once United States of America was even verging
towards a termination must now confess that a glance at the situation
dissipates any such fond idea. Without entering into a minute
consideration of the military events which have recently occurred it
may well be predicated of them that they have postponed the conclusion
of the civil war <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>. Those whose
proclivities are towards the South, while giving every credit to Meade
for the only piece of real generalship that has been developed by the
Federal leaders, still preserve their faith in the star of Lee. They
still believe that, if he has received a check, he has nevertheless
retired in good order, and only leans back the better to leap forward,
as the French proverb has it. They assert that his movement into the
enemy's country was not an invasion, but a raid to procure stores and
provisions elsewhere than in his own somewhat exhausted territory:
they prophesy a great Southern victory, and treat the surrender of
Vicksburg as an organised <hi rend="italic">canard</hi> for Federal
purposes in connection with the chartered American anniversary of the
4th of July. Assuming that the next news fulfils these expectations we
still doubt whether carrying the war into the dominions of the North
was calculated to promote the cessation of hostilities. People talk
of a decisive battle won by the South as likely to bring about a
settlement of the dispute. In such a contest as that in which North
and South are engaged decisive battles are not likely to occur. As
yet, there has been no approach on either side to such a victory as
would be entitled to rank even theoretically, amongst decisive
battles; and we confess we do not see much chance of the attainment of
any such success either by Meade or Lee. This civil war has within it
peculiar elements. It is not the sanguinary sport of Kings, but the
deadly struggle of a divided people for political and social
supremacy. It partakes of the fierce contention between individual
men; it has the unnatural ferocity which characterises the hatred of
brothers which has risen to the height of a thirst for each other's
blood. It is not tempered by the chivalry which belongs to war carried
on between two different nations, and it has long passed beyond the
reach of that diplomacy which is always watching a favourable moment
to intervene in a quarrel between rival Monarchs. He is hardy who
ventures to predict anything which relates to this American
difficulty; but we will venture to say that the only circumstance
which seems to us likely to have an influence on the contest will be
the next Presidential election. Many reasons, which it is not
convenient for us to enter upon now, might be stated to show why this
event may become the turning point of the quarrel. It was the election
of one President which was the immediate cause of the war; the
election of another may be the means of bringing it to an
end.</p></div2>

<p>The tide of success seems to have set in at present for the
Federals. To the repulse met with at Gettysburg by General Lee,
announced in our last Number, we have now to add a still more serious
blow to the pride and interests of the South in the fall of
Vicksburg.</p>
<p>First, let us follow the fortunes of General Lee. By the details
which have come to hand of the battle of the 3rd inst., at Gettysburg,
we find that it was as General Meade described it, "one of the
severest actions of the war." It lasted twelve hours, from daybreak to
five in the afternoon; and during the whole of that time the
Confederate forces were engaged in successive assaults of the most
obstinate character on different points of the Federal position. The
battle opened by a vigourous cannonade and assault on the extreme
Federal left, the enemy striving, by a series of rapid and fierce
attacks, to pierce or turn it early in the day. After three hours'
fighting, however, the attnnpt not only failed, but the Confederate
right was forced back across the whole battle-field of that morning
and the previous day. During this attack on the left a resolute and
formidable attempt was made to flank the Federal right, and it is
clear that the superior position of the Confederates gave them every
prospect of success in this direction. Behind the Confederate left
rose a densely-wooded and lofty hill, from the summit of which the
Confederate batteries could command the Federal right and centre on
Cemetery Hill. The great effort of the day was to turn this position,
and at one time it seemed doubtful whether the effort would not be
successful. In the assault upon it General Hill's corps was brought
from the other wing to reinforce General Ewell. The reserve Federal
artillery brought into play from elevated points behind the Cemetery
Hill, and the vigourous resistance of the eleventh corps on the
Federal right, partially checked the Confederate advance; but the
opportune arrival of two bridgades of militia to reinforce the Federal
right obliged the Canfederates to retire. They retired, however,
slowly, fighting desperately at every step until the afternoon, when
their attempt to turn the right was finally abandoned. Within an hour
another and final effort was, however, made. The Confederate troops
were again massed along the whole Federal line, but by five o'clock
they were driven back at all points, and the engagement terminated,
leaving the field in the hands of the Federals. The loss on both sides
is roughly estimated at 30,000. The Federals have also captured a
large number of prisoners with numerous waggon-trains, colours, and
arms.</p>
<p>On the 4th, General Lee retreated from Gettysburg by two
roads--through Fairfield on one side, and through Cashtown and
Greencastle on the other--to Hagerstown, where his head-quarters
are. Hagerstown is only a few miles from Williamsport, on the Potomac,
where the bridge of boats, by which part of the Confederate army
passed into Maryland, remains. The Potomac is, however, so greatly
swollen by recent rains that it is impossible either to ford it or to
build pontoon bridges across it. General Meede marched in pursuit as
rapidly as the state of the roads would permit.</p>
<p>To the 13th there had been no fresh engagement, except some
skirmishes between the hostile armies in Maryland; but a battle was
believed to be imminent. General Lee, whose forces are said to occupy
a strong position around Hagerstown, was engaged in sending his
wounded men and his commissariat stores across the Potomac, but none
of his troops had quitted Maryland, and he had drawn fresh supplies of
ammunition from Virginia. There was a rumour that hehad been joined by
40,000 men from General Beauregard's army. The Federal forces under
General Meade and General Couch were concentrating in front of the
Confederate army, and would, it was supposed assume the offensive, and
assail General Lee's position.</p>
<p>Vicksburg has surrendered unconditionally. On the 3rd General
Pemberton sent two officers to the camp of General Grant, to ask that
commissioners should be appointed to settle the terms of the
surrender.  This request was refused. General Pemberton himself then
had an interview with General Grant, and the surrender was agreed
upon. The garrison, variously stated at 10,000, 12,000, and 27,000
fighting men, were paroled, and rations given them to enable them to
reach their lines. The guns and arms captured are very numerous. The
immediate causes of surrender were the exhaustion of supplies and
ammunition and the failure of General Johnston to come to the
assistance of the garrison. The fleet of Admiral Porter is now ready
to co-operate in the attack on Port Hudson, whilst is reckoned that no
fewer than 100,000 veteran troops are placed at the disposal of the
Federal Government. Of the whereabouts of Johnstone, who was to have
relieved Vicksburg, no mention is made. Southern papers speak of an
advance of their troops upon New Orleans, and the capture of some
thousands of Federal soldiers.  General Neal Dow has been
captured. These accounts are probably exaggerated. It appears,
however, to be certain that a considerable body of Confederates had
shown themselves between General Banks and New Orleans, and that
alarm existed in that city. The recovery of New Orleans was not
probable, but the relief of Port Hudson and the capture of Banks were
within the bounds of proba<pb n="79"/>bility. Thus success and defeat swing from
side to side, and the bloody contest continues without results.</p>
<p>General Dix is reported to have abandoned White House, and 
returned to Fortress Monroe, after destroying the railway
communication between Richmond and Lee's army.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Bragg has crossed the Tennessee River and
destroyed the bridge at Bridgeport. It is stated that General Bragg
will make the Tennessee River his future line of defence.</p>
<p>General Morgan, the active Confederate leader, with 8000 men, has
captured Corydon, Indiana, and is advancing to Jeffersonville, where
there are large Federal supplies. Business is suspended at
Indianopolis, and the Governor of Indiana has called out 50,000
men.</p>
<p>Between 8000 and 9000 Confederates, under Generals Holmes, Price,
and Marmaduke, made an attack on Helena, Arkansas, on the morning of
the 4th. They advanced in three columns, but the roughness of the
ground prevented them bringing up their artillery, and they attempted
to carry their works by assault. The centre column charged in the
direction of Fort Curtis, and took three lines of rifle-pits. The
flank attack was not so successful, which subjected the centre to an
enfilading fire, which swept them down in great numbers. They were
soon surrounded, and one whole brigade, numbering 840, was
captured.</p>
<p>Among the vessels recently overhauled by the Confederate cruisers
was the George Griswold, which some time ago brought to Liverpool a
cargo of provisions for the operatives of the cotton-manufacturing
districts. The ship was on her way from Cardiff to Rio with a cargo of
coals, belonging, it would seem, to British subjects; and she was,
therefore, released on the captain giving the bond usually demanded in
such cases. The following vessels have been captured and burnt by the
Alabama:--The ship Amazonian, bound from New York to Monte Video, was
burnt on the 2nd of June; and the Jabez Snow, bound from Liverpool for
Monte Video, was burnt on the 29th of May. The crews of these vessels
were landed at Monte Video. The Georgia captured the ship Hope, bound
from Boston to the Cape of Good Hope, together with the G. W. Seaver,
bound from Boston for Rio. The latter vessel was released upon giving
bonds for 15,000 dols. The Pernambuco papers state that the Florida,
Confederate cruiser, has taken possession of the Rocas Islands--a
small group of desert rocks near the Island of Fernando Noronha--as
her base of operations.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>At Washington, on the evening of the 7th, President Lincoln,
General Halleck, and Secretaries Seward were serenaded on the receipt
of the news of the surrender of Vicksburg. In returning thanks the
President made an unimportant speech, General Halleck claimed the
merit of retaining General Grant in command, and consequently of the
victory he achieved. Secretary Stanton declared that the real victory
had been won over Copperheads as well as rebels. Mr. Seward admitted
that he was originally opposed to the war, and desired to put it off,
if possible. If that were a weakness there was a warrant for it in the
character of Him who died to save the world, who desired the cup to
pass from Him if his Heavenly Father pleased, but, if not, He would
accept it. Another report states that Mr. Seward said:--"He had been
censured for his predictions that the rebellion would be ended in
ninety days, and it would have been ended before it was begun if
councils of patriots had been held. It had been protracted by the
hopes held out of foreign interference. If foreign nations would keep
their hands off the Americans would settle all their own
quarrels."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that there has been
a crisis in the Cabinet in reference to the peace question. Mr. Seward
wished to issue a Presidential proclamation offering an amnesty to all
but the leaders of the rebellion, withdrawing the emancipation
proclamation, suspending the Confiscation Act, and offering protection
to the personal property and rights of the Southern people. According
to the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, he was opposed by a majority of
the Cabinet. The Republican party are said to be preparing a petition
to the President, in reference to the restoration of peace and the
Union, on the basis of the extinction of slavery in 1876.</p>
<p>The Washington Government had refused to allow Mr. Stephens, the
Confederate Vice-President, to present in person to President Lincoln
important communications from Presdent Jefferson Davis. The Southern
papers state that Vice-President Stephens's visit to Washington was
either to arrange for the exchange of prisoners or to inform the
Federal Government that if private property was not respected the
Confederates would retaliate. The <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> asserts that Vice-President Stephens's message was a
proposition from President Davis for a separate Government for the
North and South, but only one President. The Tribune says that the
Secretary of War has given orders for mounting guns and garrisoning
the forts in Portland Harbour, and has authorised the Governor of
Maine to raise artillery companies for the defence of the coast
towns.</p>
<p>It is stated that the Federal Government has ordered a levy of
300,000 conscripts. A serious riot has occurred at New York caused by
the enforcement of the draught.</p>
<p>Martial law has been declared in Louisville. All citizens have
been ordered to enrol themselves, or to go North.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate States of
America.--Privateering.</hi>--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Cobden</hi>
called attention to the exploits of the Oreto, alias the Florida; the
Alabama, alias the 290; and the Japan, alias the Virginia. The
hon. gentleman having dwelt upon the provisions of the Foreign
Enlistment Act, and to the attacks which the above-named vessels had
made upon the merchandise of a friendly Power, remarked that every
vessel which was captured by them was taken note of by the American
Government. In all cases the value of the vessels seized were taken by
deposition on oath, and in all cases a claim was made for compensation
on this country. The Government always resisted these claims; but
that was the most serious part of the matter; and he contended that in
such cases every man ought to constitute themselves a detective
policeman, in order that these proceedings might be frowned down. By
every feeling of reciprocity towards the American people we ought to
strive to put down these illegal practices. He thought there was
every claim upon the Government to prevent these armed vessels from
leaving these shores. He hoped that by no technical evasion another
vessel for Confederate purposes would be allowed to escape from these
shores. The terrors of the civil war in America were frightful; but he
hoped they would not be extended by any connection with it on our
part. All he asked for was neutrality. Whatever might be the issue of
this dreadful war, let England keep clear of it. His voice would be
mute; but what he asked was that England should be silent and
sorrowful until this dreadful civil war was over.--Mr. <hi
rend="smallcap">Laird</hi> denied that the Alabama went out of
Liverpool in an improper way.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Cobden</hi>
said he quoted Earl Russell.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Laird</hi> said
he was not responsible for what Earl Russell said. She went out of
dock in the broad daylight.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Cobden</hi>: Did
she take a clearance?==Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Laird</hi>: She did not
require a clearance.--Lord <hi rend="smallcap">Palmerston</hi> looked
upon the two parties in America as in arms against each other, and, as
such, belligerents, and therefore entitled to all the right and
privileges of belligerents. That which was running in the head of the
hon. gentleman, and which guided his reasoning as well as his
feeling, was that the Union was in legal existence, that there were
not two belligerents, but a legitimate Government and a rebellion
against that Government. Now what was the duty of a neutral with
regard to two belligerents? The American Government had laid it dawn
for themselves; for they had laid it down that a neutral might supply
a belligerent with ships, arms, ammunition, or anything else, although
they might be important ingredients in naval and military
operations. The hon. gentleman complained that her Majesty's
Government had not taken proper steps in this matter, but had rested
upon information derived from the American Minister. He assured the
hon. gentleman that that was not the case, and he believed that the
hon. gentleman and the Federal Government were not entitled to say
that the Government had omitted to do anything that by law they could
do in reference to this matter. At the same time, he thought this
country ought to enforce its law in these matters as stringently as
possible.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Journal of a Residence on a Georgian
Plantation</hi>. By Frances Anne Kemble. (1 vol. Longmans.) There can
be no doubt respecting the genuineness of the greater number of events
recorded in this book, for they are matters of personal experience,
put upon paper by the wife of a planter; and that planter was amongst
by no means the smaller slaveowners. Nevertheless, when we reflect
that the journal refers to the years 1838-9--that is to say, to a
period four or five and twenty years ago--and that four or five and
twenty years ago in a fast-growing country like America are equivalent
to much more than a quarter of a century in settled civilisations, it
would not be fair to conclude that things are now as they were
then. At least, some weighty proof should be required that they
are. In this place it will be sufficient to say that the writer
indorses the thrilling account of Mrs. Beecher Stowe, in her story,
"Uncle Tom's Cabin;" nay, further, she observes, "The ideal excellence
of the principal character is no argument at all against the general
accuracy of her statements with regard to the evils of slavery;
everything else in her book is not only possible, but probable; and
not only probable, but a very faithful representation of the existing
facts; faithful, and not, as you accuse it of being, exaggerated; for,
with the exception of the horrible catastrophe, the flogging to death
of poor Tom, she has portrayed none of the most revolting instances of
cruelty produced by the slave system with which she might have
darkened her picture without detracting from its perfect truth." This
is an extract from her letter to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, but
some time, of course, after the date of her personal experiences; and
in her Preface she writes--"the record contained in the following
pages is a picture of conditions of human existence <hi
rend="italic">which I hope and believe have passed away</hi>." Now, no
Englishman, it may be presumed, would have the front to advocate
slavery; but recent events have brought the subject once more
prominently forward, and the author has doubtless considered it a
favourable opportunity for compelling attention; hence the present
publication. The writer appends a letter containing her opinions upon
the result of the lamentable conflict now raging beyond the Atlantic;
it is impossible to give a summary of all she says, but she
concludes:--"Perhaps, however, Mr. Jefferson Davis means to free the
negroes. Whenever that consummation is attained the root of bitterness
will have perished from the land; and when a few years shall have
passed, blunting the hatred which has been excited by this fratricidal
strife, the Americans of both the Northern and Southern States will
perceive that the selfish policy of other nations would not have so
rejoiced over their division had it not seemed, to those who loved
them not, the proof of past failure and the prophecy of future
weakness. Admonished by its terrible experiences, I believe the nation
will reunite itself under one Government, remodel its constitution,
and again address itself to fulfil its glorious destiny." Let us make
our comment in the words of Homer--<hi rend="italic">&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03B4;&#x03B5;

<p rend="center><hi rend="smallcap">Serious Riots At New
York.</hi></p>
<p>The attempt to enforce the conscription in New York has either
provoked, or been made the excuse for, formidable riots. That city was
for three days in the hands of a mob, which commenced with stopping
the draughting, destroying the building in which it was going on, and
assaulting the officers. This was but the prelude. Houses were
assailed, plundered, and fired; shops sacked; the streets filled with
the denizens of the back slums; and the outbreak at last took the
shape of an anti-abolitionist crusade, and a hunt for unarmed negroes,
and the burning down of the Coloured Orphan Asylum. The outbreak ended
with a thieves' carnival.</p>
<p>Balloting began on Saturday, the 11th ult., and during that day the
names of more than 20OO conscripts were drawn. On the morning of the
13th a mob assembled in front of the Provost Marshal's office, broke
into it, destroyed the ballot-boxes, and fired the building, which,
with the adjoining houses, was completely destroyed, as the firemen
refused to attempt to extinguish the flames. The mob, which is said to
have consisted of about 15000, persons, composed mostly of the
labouring population, infuriated women, and lads of seventeen
downwards, and to have been headed by a Virginian named Andrews and
some three hundred other leaders, afterwards dispersed in strong
bodies throughout the city, and committed atrocious outrages. The
rioters burned the Armoury, the Coloured Orphan Asylum, and many
houses inhabited by obnoxious persons or by negroes. They sacked the
office of the <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> and fired the
building, which was, however, saved from destruction by the
firemen. They assailed all the negroes whom they found in the streets,
and murdered some fifty unhappy blacks--one of whom they hanged and
burned by a fire kindled beneath him. A party of the Provost's Guard
fired on the mob, but were overpowered and horribly used; and many
policemen were slain or maltreated--Superintendent Kennedy saving his
life with difficulty. On the following day the riots were renewed, and
all the shops were closed--business being completely suspended, cabs
and omnibuses having ceased to ply, and the city telegraphs having
been destroyed by the mob. More houses, including the Postmaster's,
were burned, and the Mayor's dwelling was assailed. There were several
encounters between the soldiery or militia and the rioters, and many
lives were lost. The mob seized Colonel O'Brien and hanged him on a
lamppost. The disturbances spread to Staten Island, and some negroes'
houses were burned in Brooklyn; but few or no further murders of
blacks were committed, as the negroes had fled from the city. On the
15th the riots continued, business was again suspended, and there were
several fresh collisions between the troops and mob in the upper part
of New York.</p>
<p>During these riots the authorities had not been idle; for they had
summoned a special police, had called out the militia, and had brought
a considerable body of troops from Baltimore, while Governor Seymour
had declared the city and county of New York to be in a state of
insurrection. But the diminution of the rioting on the 15th ult. seems
to have been mainly due to a proclamation and speech of the Governor
of the State of New York. In his proclamation, Governor Seymour
declared that the only opposition to the conscription that would be
allowed was an appeal to the Courts, and that he would suppress
rioting by every means in his power. In his speech, however, he said
that he had applied to the Federal Cabinet at Washington, and had
urged the postponement of the draught. He added that the decision of
the courts on the question of the legality of the draught must be
obeyed if the draught were declared legal, but that he would use his
influence to prevent inequality between rich and poor.</p>
<p>New York papers of the 18th state that the riots had almost
entirely subsided on the previous day. The wards where the greatest
excitement had prevailed were filled with large forces of military,
who patrolled the streets entirely unmolested by the
populace. Business went on almost as generally as before the
unfortunate disturbances took place, and all the cars and stages
performed their trips as usual. A number of regiments had arrived from
different quarters, and the authorities did not apprehend any further
disturbance.</p>
<p>The Republican press argue that the riots in New York are really
part and parcel of the Southern rebellion, while the Democratic press
assert the obnoxious conditions of the draught to be the sole
cause. But Americans would gladly escape the principal blame of this
disgraceful riot, and lay it on the Irish.</p>
<p>It is officially announced that the Government will sustain the
enforcement of the draught with military force.</p>
<p>There has been resistance to the draught in Boston, but the
disturbances were promptly suppressed.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia and Massachusetts the draught was proceeding
quietly.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">War News.</hi></p>
<p>General Lee's army has repassed the Potomac into Virginia at
Williamsport and Falling Waters; and the movement, which appears to
have been completed on the 13th or 14th ult., was said to have been
effected in good order, though the Federal forces captured two guns
and 2000 prisoners, including an entire brigade of infantry, which may
be presumed to have composed the Confederate rearguard. General Lee,
when last heard of, was at Front Royal, making his way towards
Richmond.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Morgan's "raid" into Indiana and Ohio had
not terminated, and, after crossing the Indianopolis and Cincinnati
Railway at a point thirty-five miles from Cincinnati, he had reached a
place called Miamisville, only seventeen miles from that city.</p>
<p>In Tennessee General Rosencranz was still driving General Bragg
before him, and had captured 4000 prisoners.</p>
<p>General Dodge officially reports that he routed the Confederates
under Forrest and Biffles in the neighbourhood of Corinth.</p>
<p>The fall of Port Hudson has followed that of Vicksburg. The
fortress surrendered unconditionally on the 8th ult. The number of
prisoners will not exceed 7000--one informant places them at
6000. There had been no general engagement at Port Hudson for some
days previous to the surrender, all having been quiet, excepting that
artillery practice was kept up on both sides. Provisions had been
short with the Confederates for some time, and, their communications
having been cut off, they could not obtain more supplies. There were
no hopes of succour from the forces known to be in the vicinity; hence
there was no alternative but surrender or starvation.</p>
<p>Immediately after the surrender of Vicksburg General Sherman
marched against General Johnston, and is said to have defeated him
after a very sanguinary engagement.</p>
<p>A fresh attack on the defences of Charleston commenced on the 10th
ult., and a landing having been effected on Morris Island, all the
Confederate works on that island, with the single exception of Fort
Wagner, were captured by the Federals. According to accounts of the
12th ult., the siege at Fort Wagner was progressing; and five
ironclads and fifteen gunboats were engaged in battering and bombardmg
the Confederate defences.</p>
<p>A vessel that has arrived at Falmouth reports the capture and
destruction of two fine North American vessels by Captain Semmes, of
the Confederate cruiser Florida. One of the vessels is said to have
had bar silver on board to the value of £20,000. The crews of the
two vessels were put on board the ship that brought the news to
Falmouth.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General News.</hi></p>
<p>President Lincoln has ordered the 2nd of August to be set apart as
a day of thanksgiving for victories so effective and signal as to
furnish reasonable ground for augmented confidence that the Union and
the Constitution will be preserved, and that peace and prosperity will
be permanently maintained.</p>
<p>It is semi-officially announced that the question of peace has not
come before the Washington Cabinet, no condition of affairs having yet
existed rendering it necessary to entertain so important a
position. The Cabinet is agreed that the best wayto obtain peace is to
prosecute the war vigorously.</p>
<p>Official correspondence between Mr. Stephens and President Davis
shows that the proposed mission of Mr. Stephens to Washington had for
its objects the establishment of a fresh cartel for the exchange of
prisoners, and to place the war upon the footing of hostilities waged
by modern civilised nations.</p>
<p>The United States' Circuit Court has reversed the decision of the
Lower Court, condemning the barque Express, the Judge deciding<pb
n="103"/> that a vessel may approach a blockaded port to ascertain
the state of the blockade, provided that she does so in good
faith.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap"><hi rend="italic">London:
Saturday, August</hi> 1, 1863.</hi></p>
<p> <hi rend="smallcap">Record</hi>, not comment, and far less
prediction, seems the only philosophic treatment of the great
Transatlantic struggle. For every prophecy has in its turn been
falsified, and the sagest arguments are made ridiculous by the latest
telegram. A very short time ago, and no colour could be too roseate
for depicting the condition of the South. Its fortresses were
impregnable, while its gallant armies were advancing to hoist the
secession flag upon the steeples of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York, Again all changed, for the tenth time. A new Federal General (in
his childhood known to the Duke of Wellington, it is said, though
dates smile scornfully at the statement) has confronted the Southern
victor, prevented his advance, and made his retreat an act of probable
wisdom. Two of the great fortresses have fallen, and the third is
menaced by a more powerful force than has yet assailed it. The
resources of the North are telling fearfully upon the
Confederates.</p>
<p>Yet the next mail, or its successor, may have a new story to
tell. Meade may have followed his foe, been led into a trap, and been
discomfited; or some new and brilliant stroke of Southern tactics may
have thrown some hitherto unattached territory into the alarm which
shook Philadelphia and almost roused New York. The dread game is being
played on so large a board, and with such utter absence of rules, that
none of its chances should surprise us. In the meantime, and at the
very moment when Meade's skill and valour had excited the enthusiasm
of his countrymen, New York was suddenly delivered over to a worse
enemy than the Confederate. Riot was rampant, the negro was hunted
down by the light of a score of conflagrations kindled in various
quarters, the authorities were defied and outraged, and some of them
murdered, and violence and plunder were the order--or disorder--of the
hour. The rabble had broken loose. We hear since that the military
have used shot and steel freely, that large numbers of the rioters
have been slaughtered, and that the law is once more master, and will
enforce the conscription. But the scenes, which are presented to us
with a general exaggeration, corrected by the elaborate detail which
the American reader loves, will scarcely pass from the memory of the
New Yorker. He had previously only heard of slaughter: he has now seen
it, and in its most repulsive form.</p>
<p>No Englishman can read of such work without regret. Upon the war
itself there may be two opinions, and there can be no doubt that there
are many British partisans of the South as of the North, though the
majority of us cordially approve the policy of our Government and
agree with the sentiment expressed in the Royal Speech; but all of us
deplore the New York outrages. We never tolerate at home the
interference of rioters or the mob in settling a question; and, where
there are two sides actively espoused, and a rabble thrusts itself
into the struggle, both sides coalesce and put down the rioters. We
have the Anglo-Saxon liking for seeing any dispute settled by legitimate means. Hence the people of New York, who have been exposed to the brutalities of a fractional portion of its dangerous classes, have our sympathy, and we shall all be glad to know that the strong hand has restored order. It is a libel upon Englishmen to allege that they have the slightest toleration for the perpetrators of atrocities like those which are described by
the American correspondents. It is possible that there may have been
some in the riots who hate or fear the conscription but it is obvious
that the majority of the rioters are scoundrels whose ferocity and
greediness have been roused, and who took advantage of the absence of
troops to commit these outrages. We hope to hear that the castigation
has been ample and effectual; and we have a right to expect our
relatives in New York to believe that we feel towards them in the
matter as they would feel towards us if they heard that a St. Giles's
mob had broken loose, had ravaged certain districts of the metropolis,
and had been met by a cavalry regiment and dealt with according to
desert. We are almost ashamed to have to insist upon this, but certain
writers have made it necessary that such an assurance should go forth
to the West.</p>
<p>We may add another, and we do so in all heartiness and
sincerity. The London season is over, a portion of our population has
already escaped from town, and those who remain are but devising plans
for recreation and amusement. Another fortnight and our notables will
either be in their country houses, regaining their own health and
ministering to the pleasures of their friends, or they will be
hastening away over Europe, many with their faces set for other
continents. The middle class, after a prosperous season, will be
imitating their leaders, but in a modified degree. A noble harvest is
all but ready. We are assured, on the highest authority, that European
complications and American war have not materially injured our
commerce. Care has been taken for the class most affected by the
latter casualty, and there will not be much "complaining in our
streets." We are at peace with the world, and we have no epidemic
among our people or among our flocks. We have every reason to be
thankful; and most of us are about to endeavour to enjoy our
selves. It would be unworthy of us did we, in our own hour of comfort,
forget our kinsmen whose fortune is now so different. We speak of the
whole of the States of America; we speak not of Federals and
Confederates, but of our brethren who talk our language and who think
of England as the mother country. At this moment how opposite is their
condition. Their best men, their citizens, fathers, husbands, brothers
are in arms, and engaged in a war which offers no promise of
conclusion. Their commerce is hindered, their produce belongs to the
armies, and they are struggling with a taxation which must grind them
cruelly. A conscription calls Northern and Southern alike into the
field. And they have to deplore the loss of thousands and thousands
who have fallen in the field, or by a less enviable fate, and who, if
this weary war continues, will be followed to the grave by other
thousands. Such is the autumn to which our American brethren are
looking. Let them, throughout the length and breadth of their noble
country, accept the assurance that, though they turn a cold and
scornful eye towards those who will take neither one side nor the
other, the sympathy of Englishmen and Englishwomen goes forth to them,
and that those who seek to persuade them otherwise utter cowardly and
wicked untruth. Without, we dare assert, any mingling of a selfish
motive in the feeling, the news that the quarrel had been somehow
adjusted, and that the sword was sheathed, would cause a shout of joy
over the island, and as warm thanksgiving would ascend as on the day
which President Lincoln has set apart for a religious service. These
are not idle words, and, inasmuch as we know that they will be read in
most parts of the States, we call upon American readers to note them,
and to remember them when the time of slaughter shall have passed
away.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL MEADE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Major-General George G. Meade</hi>, the new
Commander of the army of the Potomac was born in Spain, about the year
1815, of American parents. He entered West Point Military Academy as
an appointee from the State of Pennsylvania during September, 1831,
and graduated on the 30th of June, 1833. Meade was appointed to the
army from the district of Columbia, and entered the service as brevet
Second Lieutenant of the 3rd Artillery on the 1st of July, 1835. He
did not receive his full commission until the 31st of December, 1835,
when he was made a full Second Lieutenant. On the 26th of October,
1836, he resigned his connection with the United States' army, and was
engaged in private pursuits until 1842. On the l9th of May, 1842, he
was reappointed to the United States' military service as a Second
Lieutenant of Topographical Engineers. In this capacity he joined the
troops engaged in the Mexican War. His conduct in Mexico was marked by
determination and bravery, and at the battle of Palo Alto he won great
reputation. During the several conflicts of Monterey, on the 21st,
22nd, and 23rd days of September, 1846, he again distinguished
himself, and for his bravery was breveted a First Lieutenant, to date
from the 23rd of September, 1846. This brevet was awarded in May,
1847. During the month of August, 1851, he was promoted to a first
lieutenancy of his corps, and on the 19th of May, 1856, was further
promoted to a captaincy.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, and President Lincoln called for three
hundred thousand volunteers, the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps was raised
and placed under the charge of General M'Call, as division
corninander, and Generals Reynolds, Meade, and Ord, as brigade
commanders. Meade was appointed a Brigadier-General of volunteers,
with a commission to date from Aug. 31, 1861. He was then placed in
charge of the second brigade of that division, and proceeded to
organize it at Tennallytown, near the waters of the Potomac, and in
this vicinity wintered during 1861-2. When the army of the Potomac
began to move upon Manassas, duning March 1862, the division in which
General Meade served was attached in the first corps, then under
General M'Dowell. With him they remained north of the Rappahannock
until after the battle of Hanover Station, when they were added to the
army of the Potomac, occupying part of the right wing, with division
head-quarters in the vicinity of Mechanicsville. About this
time--viz., June 18--he was promoted to a majority in the Engineer
Corps, which rank he still holds in the newly-organised Engineer Corps
of the regular army. On the 26th of June he took part in the famous
battle of Mechanicsville where General  Stonewall Jackson made such a
terrible dash upon General M'Clellan's right wing, and Generals
M'Call, Reynolds, and others were taken prisoners. His bravery on this
occasion was particularly noticed. The next day be was engaged, under
General Fitz-John Porter, in the battle of Gaines' Mill, and was so
distinguished that he was nominated for a brevet of Lieutenant-Colonel
for services during that battle. He took part in some of the
subsequent engagements of the seven days' fight. At the battle of New
Market Cross Roads he was severely wounded; but, under skilful
treatment, he recovered, and almost immediately returned to the army,
where he took command of the division until the return of Generals
M'Call and Reynolds from captivity in Richmond. When the Confederates
invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania after the defeats of General Pope's
army, General Reynolds, who had commanded the division was detached to
organise the Pennsylvania Militia, and General Meade was placed in
command of the division of Pennsylvania Reserves. He led these troops
during the eventful battles of South Mountain and Antietam; and when,
at the latter battle, General Hooker was wounded and had to leave the
field, General Mesde for a short time had charge of the ninth army
corps, formerly under General Reno.</p>
<p>After General Burnside had been placed in charge of the army of the
Potomac General Reynolds, who formerly commanded the Pennsylvania
Reserves, after the retirement of General M'Call, was ordered to
command the whole of the first army corps, and General Meade was
formally placed in command of the division of Pennsylvania
Reserves. At the battle of Fredericksburg, Dec. 13, l862, he again
distinguished himself, and his division lost very heavily, the brigade
commanders and several field officers being placed hors de combat
during the attack on the Confederate right. The whole loss of the
division was 1624, being the greatest division loss during the whole
of that disastrous fight. On<pb n="118"/> the 15th of December, two
days after this eventful battle, he was ordered to command the fifth
army corps, formerly under General Fitz-John Porter and more recently
under General Butterfield. To enable him properly to hold that
position he was appointed by the President a Major-General of
volunteers, and was regularly nominated to the United States' Senate
during January, 1863. The Senate making certain objections to the
lists of appointees, it was revised, and General Meade's name again
sent in by the President. During March, the Senate, in Executive
Session, confirmed the appointment, and General Meade took his rank
and commission as Major-General of United States' volunteers, from the
29th of November, 1862, and assumed the command of the fifth army
corps.</p>
<p>When General Hooker assumed command of the army of the Potomac and
reorganised the same, he retained General Meade as the commander of
the fifth army corps, General Butterfield having obtained a position
on the Staff of the commanding officer. During the advance upon
Chancellorsville General Meade's corps formed part of the right wing
of Hooker's army. The corps started on its march on the 20th day of
April, 1863, and arrived at Kelly's Ford on the 28th. The next day it
crossed the Rappahannock by that ford and the Rapidan by Ely's
Ford. It then pushed on to Chancellorsville, where it arrived on the
30th and engaged the skirmishers of the Confederates, taking their
rifle-pits and temporary works. During the fearful contests of May 2,
3, and 4 General Meade's corps played its part in the same
distinguished manner that had characterised the troops under his
special command since the commencement of the war. It bore its part
manfully, and in the end covered the retreat of the whole of Hooker's
army. During the subsequent heavy forced march General Meade's troops
bore up under the burning rays of nearly a tropical sun; and, although
other corps straggled and hung back, Meade's corps held its own.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 28 Colonel Hardie arrived by special train
from Washington, as bearer of despatches relieving General Hooker from
the command of the army of the Potomac and appointing Major-General
Meade his successor.</p>
<p>The despatches from America recently published show that General
Meade is equal to the duties of his high position. Starting in
pursuit of the Confederate army, under General Lee, which had invaded
Maryland and Pennsylvania, the rival forces met at Gettysburg. A
series of fierce assaults made by the Confederates on the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd of July were repelled; General Lee was constrained to fall
back on the Potomac, and, as we learn this week, has withdrawn his
army to Virginia, leaving a brigade of infantry, with two guns, in the
hands of the Federals.</p></div2>

<p>In the course of a debate in the House of Commons some time ago,
Mr. Laird stated that soon after the outbreak of the civil war in
America a gentlemen from the United States waited upon him "with the
view of getting vessels built in this country for the Federal
Government." Mr. Welles, the Federal Secretary to the Navy, has
written a letter, in which he states that no person was ever
authorised by the Northern Government to apply to Mr. Laird, or any
other foreign builder, to supply ships to the United States. On the
other hand, the Navy Department had been solicited for orders by
persons professing to represent English ship-building firms; and
Mr. Welles has an "indistinct remembrance" that "more than one person"
"importuned" on behalf of the Messrs. Laird. But he "pursued a uniform
and undeviating policy in regard to each and all of those
applications, declining, in every instance, any proposition to build,
or procure to be built, vessels for our (Federal) navy abroad."
Mr. Laird, however, adheres to his original statement, and has offered
to place in Lord Palmerston's hands the documents upon which he relies
for the vindication of his veracity. He has since replied to the
letter of the Federal Secretary to the Navy, by publishing what we
presume are the documents he offered to place in the hands of Lord
Palmerston, with the view of showing that he only stated the truth
when he told the House of Commons that overtures had been made to him
for the construction of ships of war for the service of the United
States. Mr. Laird withholds for the present the name of the gentleman
who represented himself to be the authorised agent of Mr. Gideon
Welles; but we infer from one of the letters that the hon. gentleman
may yet consider himself bound, in self defence, to make a disclosure
which, in the interest of his correspondent he has been anxious to
avoid. Mr. Laird further states that if any person has "importuned"
the American Navy Department in behalf of his firm, he has done so
without any authority.</p></div2>

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the evening of July 25. The
position and intentions of General Lee were at that date somewhat
doubtful. It was at one time thought that he was rapidly retreating
down the west side of the Shenandoah Valley, and General Meade crossed
the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, and moved down the western side of the
Blue Ridge to intercept him; but it was found that the Confederate
General was closely hugging the line of the Upper Potomac, and fears
were entertained of another invasion of Maryland. Another conjecture
was that he had delayed there to carry across his plunder and to carry
away the new crop of that fertile valley, and that he intended to
cross the mountains into Eastern Virginia at Chester or Thornton
Gap. In that case probably a battle<pb n="127"/> would take place. It
is reported that General Lee has been reinforced by General D. H. Hill
with 10,000 men from Lower Virginia.</p>
<p>General Kelly, who was superintending the construction of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was driven back by the Confederates
fifteen miles from North Mountain to Hancock. General Gregg had
encountered General Stuart's cavalry, 10,000 strong, between
Hagerstown and Martinsburg. An obstinate fight ensued, General Gregg
holding his ground, but suffering heavy losses.</p>
<p>The daring raid of Morgan into Ohio has, according to one account,
come to an abrupt termination. General Shackleford officially reports
that he chased General Morgan over fifty miles, bringing him to a
stand, when a fight ensued which lasted an hour. At the expiration of
that time the Confederates fled, taking refuge upon a high
bluff. General Shackleford demanded the immediate and unconditional
surrender of Morgan and his forces. They surrendered with the
exception of Morgan, who deserted his command, taking with him a small
squadron. General Shackleford captured 1500 to 2000 prisoners. But
General Morgan, who was thus annihilated, was, at the last advices,
still marauding Ohio at the head of a large force.</p>
<p>An extensive Federal cavalry expedition left Newbern on the 18th
ult. to penetrate into North Carolina, destroying bridges and railroad
communication. The expedition burned the railroad bridge over the Tar
River and 5000 bales of cotton. Another Federal cavalry expedition,
after severe fighting, captured and destroyed Wytheville,
South-Eastern Virginia, taking 100 prisoners and two pieces of
artilllery. They cut the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at
Wytheville.</p>
<p> From Charleston the accounts are conflicting--one version
affirming that Fort Wagner still holds out, and the other that the
whole of Morris Island has been captured by the Federals. The
Charleston papers assert that the city will be defended street by
street. The whole coloured population had been impressed to work on
the defences.</p>
<p>The main interest of the news from America is with respect to the
feeling in the South. According to a Richmond journal the 100,000
Southern men who had paid for substitutes for military service must
themselves be draughted. Dictatorial powers are claimed for President
Davis, and martial law insisted on for the whole Confederacy. In
Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia it was announced that
the people were organising actively for defence. The <hi
rend=italic">New Orleans Era</hi> says President Davis has issued a
proclamation ordering all men between the ages of eighteen and
forty-five to repair to the conscript camps. The <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi> speaks of a Navy Company having
been formed, the object of which is to put as many privateers as
possible upon the sea to prey upon Federal commerce. This paper
contemplates the disintegration of the great Southern armies and a
consequent guerrilla warfare, which should be principally upon the
sea.</p>
<p>The news from Mississippi Valley shows that the Federals are
following up their late successes. General Johnston, retreating from
the neighbourhood of Vicksburg, threw his army into Jackson, where he
held the Federals at bay for more than a week. On the 16th he
evacuated the town, and his pursuers gave up further chase of him. The
<hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi> says that the evacuation of
Jackson left in the enemy's hands the rolling stock of the Orleans,
Jackson, and Great Northern, Mississippi-Central, and
Mississippi-Tennessee Railroad. Over forty engines were lost. "The
loss," continues the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi>, "is
incalculable, important, and wholly irreparable."</p>
<p>The garrison of Port Hudson, when they surrendered, had eaten their
last mule. The moment the surrender was completed the enemy sent out a
request that six thousand rations should immediately be sent in, as
the garrison had eaten its last mule. This was found to be literally
the fact.</p>
<p>We have further tidings of the operations of the Confederate
cruiser Georgia. That vessel had, since our last news of her, captured
three American vessels, two of which were released, whilst the third,
which was laden with coal--an article of the greatest value to her
captor--was being emptied, with the view, it is alleged, of fitting
her also out as a privateer. The steamer Lizzie has been captured off
Abaco, and the steamer Kate Dale off Portugal, with 800 bales of
cotton. The City of New York has arrived out. The Scotia has been
intercepted off Cape Race.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Late Riots In New
York.</hi></p>
<p>New York is again quiet, and the negroes have once more begun to
show themselves in the streets. The Common Council have passed a
series of resolutions, voting a fund of 500,000 dollars to pay the
300 dollar exemption fee for such as are not able to pay for
themselves, and pledging themselves to try the validity of the
Conscription Acts. Mr. Opdyke, the Mayor, vetoed the resolutions; but
it is supposed they will be carried again by two-thirds of the body,
which will annul the veto. It was supposed that the draught would
recommence in a week. Coloured men will not be accepted as substitutes
for white draughted men. The Mayor has offered a reward of 500 dollars
for the apprehension of any person who committed murder or arson
during the late riots. A subscription has been opened for the relief
of coloured people. Governor Seymour, in a special order, had released
the special constabulary from further duty, and states that a
sufficient force of the State militia had arrived to maintain
order. Fears, suspicions, and jealousies are mentioned as existing
respecting the designs of Governor Seymour with respect to his
contested right to the control of the State militia.</p>
<p>In a list of losses by incendiary fires seventeen distinct fires
are enumerated, comprising one or more buildings, and the estimated
loss is 400,000 dollars. Fifty-six patients have been taken to the
Bellevue Hospital, of whom thirteen have died. Fifteen dead bodies
have been placed in the dead-house of the hospital; the names are
unknown. Most of the injured seem to have received gunshot
wounds. About thirty persons concerned in the riots have been captured
by General Brown, and are held as military prisoners. It is stated,
however, that they will be handed over to the civil authorities. More
than 200 rioters were shot or bayoneted.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has resumed its silly
gasconade about a union between North and South to make war on France
said England. It asserts that the conscription will be enforced, not
to put down the rebellion, but to meet the threats of England, as the
Government is determined no longer to suffer privateers to be fitted
out in that country. The same journal urges the Government to grant
the Confederates all their rights, under the Constitution, and at once
proclaim war against France and England.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The department of Virginia has been annexed to that of North
Carolina, and placed under the control of General Foster, whose
head-quarters will hereafter be at Fortress Monroe.</p>
<p>A steamer had arrived at New Orleans from Natchez, and left on a
return trio to St. Louis, thus demonstrating the reopening of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> announces that General Meade
tendered his resignation to the President as soon as he discovered
that General Lee had crossed the Potomac, but that the President
refused to accept it.</p>
<p>The United States' District Court has affirmed the decisions of the
Lower Court, condemning the steamers Ouachita and Elizabeth, the
schooner J. S. Toone, the brig Sarah Star, and the cargo belonging to
Mr. D. Evans, but has reversed the decision condemning the cargo
belonging to Mr. Monroe.</p>
<p>Mr. Vallandigham, in an address from Niagara, accepts the
nomination for Governor of Ohio. He says that, after his journeyings,
he found himself a free man, on British soil, and exercised the
privileges and rights the usurper had denied him at home. He denies
the practicability of subjugating the South by force of arms, and
states that he met in the South not a man, woman, or child who was not
resolved to perish rather than yield to force. He met no one in the
South, whatever his opinions or station, political or private, who did
not declare his readiness, when war shall have ceased and the invading
armies are withdrawn, to consider and discuss the question of
reunion.</p>
<p>The brother of Mr. Vallandigham, a clergyman, together with a
Dr. Clarke, were arrested on the 17th, at Newark, Delaware, but were
released upon taking the oath of allegiance. No cause was assigned for
the arrest.</p>
<p>At New York, on the 25th, gold was at 27 per cent prem., and the
exchange on London at 140.</p>
<p>The whaling barque Maria, of New Bedford, United States, the
oldest vessel afloat, has just been condemned on the Peruvian
coast. She was ninety years old, and was the first ship which carried
the United States' flag in the British Channel after the
revolution.</p>
<p>The Hon. W. Whiting comes to Europe by the Asia as the accredited
agent of the Federal Government to the European Courts, and as legal
adviser to the Federal Ministers in England and France in reference to
important matters. His mission is said to have direct reference to the
fitting out of privateers.</p></div2>

Correspondent.)</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">I left</hi> Charleston with some of the
regiments ordered to report to General Johnston in view of the immense
operations about commencing in the south-west. The campaign in the
valley of the Mississippi will, I believe, decide the duration of the
war; and the battles that will be fought there under the respective
leaderships of General Johnston and General Grant (Federal) will, I
think, be on a much larger scale than those of Virginia. The incident
illustrated in the Engraving on the next page will give you an idea of
the perils of travelling on a used-up military railroad. Three times
the cars ran off the line, injuring many of the men; and on one of
these occasions the carriage in which I was got smashed all to
pieces, and for some time I was unaware of what had taken place until
I shook myself together, and then I found that my arm was badly
bruised. We can hear heavy firing in the direction of Vicksburg. The
place still holds out bravely, with a loss altogether, so says a
prisoner, of nearly 20,000 men. The dead are lying unburied between
the besieged and besiegers. The town is completely invested, and we
only get intelligence by an occasional courier, who runs the gauntlet
of the Yankee lines.</p>
<p>Jackson for a short time was occupied by the Federal army under
General Grant. The enemy entered the town in overwhelming force after
a smart engagement with very inferior numbers, who were com<pb
n="129"/>pelled to retire on the army collecting under General
Johnston for the relief of Vicksburg. During their occupation, which
lasted two days, the Yankees were guilty of every kind of vandalism;
they sacked houses, stole clothing from the negroes, burst open their
trunks, and took what little money they had, besides which they drove
off the stoutest and strongest, against their will, to work on
intrenchments, and behaved, indeed, more like savages than civilized
troops. I arrived here the day before yesterday with the
reinforcements, a portion of which you see entering the town. I
entered it with them. We found a large part of the place in flames,
buildings being fired indiscriminately by the retreating enemy, who
fled precipitately before our advance.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Attack On The Tribune
Building.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Close</hi> upon dusk a crowd, small in numbers,
had gathered before the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> office. A few
groans, a few cheers, and some "Hi hi's!" left one at a distance in
doubt of what was going on or intended; but a closer acquaintance with
the feeling of the crowd showed clearly enough that a very rough
demonstration was in contemplation against the said office. A gradual
ebullition of hostility, first among a parcel of boys in front, and
gradually extending to the rougher and more determined spirits behind
them, broke out into a regular attack. A crash of glass was heard, at
the sound of which numbers of lookers-on immediately stampeded, as if
the neighbourhood had become already too hot for them. But crash
followed upon crash, doors were rent open, and all the sounds of a
speedy demolition of counters and furniture inside told that an
entrance had been effected, and that the work of destruction under
many hands was going on.</p>
<p>To the first body of the more active participators in the
stone-throwing and window-breaking operations, were added, with the
rush of a hurricane, an immense body from the direction of
Chatham-street, who joined in immediately, and the work of destruction
inside the bnilding was evidently culminating to what appeared must be
the final result of the continued attack--the complete destruction of
the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> buildings. The first stone was
thrown at a quarter to eight o'clock. In a very few moments the lower
portion of the building was taken possession of. In almost as few
moments the police appeared, walking up leisurely through
Nassau-street; following them pretty closely, and as leisurely, came a
second body of about equal numbers, both numbering not more than about
150 men. They halted between Beekman and Spruce streets; there both
joined and formed in column at the magic signal of the "baton on the
flags." The  contents of the lower part of the building were then
flying through broken windows and gaping doors, hundreds of ready
hands aiding in the work of destruction. This halt of the police had a
purpose. But a very brief time elapsed from the forming of the column
in Nassau-street when an answering signal on the flags was heard
coming from some distance in front. The same moment the whole body, of
police in Nassau-street rushed forward in a charge, baton in hand,
some of the forward men raising the cheering cry of "Hi, hi!" which
was as cheeringly answered by numbers of people on the sidewalks and
doorfronts, and by clapping of hands as they rushed past. Two bodies
of police on the same instant charged from two other points converging
on the very centre of the crowd, through whom they dashed, scattering
them like chaff before the wind. Down they fell by dozens in the
street, the fellows who had got into the office of the <hi
rend="italic">Tribune</hi> tumbling over each other like Merry Andrews
as they hurried to escape from the scene of their own depredations,
often stricken down as they rose by the touches of the inevitable
baton-Nemesis, which mercilessly descended upon them. Instantaneously
the streets were cleared.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">A Negro Hanged.</hi></p>
<p>Intense excitement prevailed on the west side of the town. News had
reached the people up town that their fellow-citizens were in open
resistance to the draught. The feeling was, as in all other sections,
very severe against the negroes, and several were badly beaten. At
last, towards night, one negro got into difficulty with a white man;
loud words followed, and the crowd set upon the black man. He
retreated a little way, and finally drew a pistol and discharged its
contents into the crowd. The ball took effect in the breast of one of
the assailants, who fell forward as if killed. The negro, terrified at
the act, took to his legs and ran with all possible speed towards
Hudson-street, the affray having taken place in Cornelia-street, where
he lived. When near Hudson-street he was overtaken and severely
beaten. He was then stripped of all his clothes except the shirt, and
a rope was loudly demanded. One was procured from a store near by--a
stout clothes-line--and it was attached to the negro's neck. The other
end was then slung over a tree, and he was drawn up several feet. Some
of them then set his shirt on fire, and the sight presented was a
frightful one. The body remained hanging, surrounded by a dense crowd
of people, who shouted and yelled, pursuing every negro who made his
appearance. At last orders were given to have the body cut down; and
this was done, a large force being detailed for the purpose.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Rioters Cutting The Telegraph

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Provost Marshal'S House On
Fire.</hi></p>
<p>The rioters, having arranged their plans, began to move down town
by way of Fifth and Sixth avenues, until they reached the vicinity of
Forty-sixth and Forty-seventh streets, along which they proceeded in
an easterly direction. When they arrived at Fourth-avenue, along which
the New Haven and Harlem railroad tracks run, it was suggested that
the authorities might telegraph to Albany for troops. Scarcely were
the words uttered when the axes were laid at the foot of the telegraph
poles, and down they came with a terrific bang. That part of the wires
that could not be thus destroyed was divided by means of men climbing
the poles, throwing slings, stones, 
&#x0026;c., until the wires were severed and rendered completely
useless. Another branch wire, leading from the railroad to
Third-avenue, and that along Third-avenue, were similarly damaged, and
then the crowd again moved on to the Provost Marshal's office. This
office was situated on the north-east corner of Third-avenue and
Forty-sixth-street. As soon as the people had reached this position
they began to flank the building on the avenue, and on that part of
Forty-sixth-street which leads to Second-avenue. When they had taken a
position to suit themselves the signal was made to commence the
attack. This signal was given by the throwing of a large stone through
one of the panes of glass, and as soon as this was done a rush was
made for the entrances and windows.</p>
<p>After a very short interval, and before any of the persons in the
upper part of the premises had had time to remove their furniture, the
flames burst out of that part of the building where the offices were
held (on the ground floor), and soon were master of the entire
edifice, which was four stories in height. A current of wind blew the
flames across Forty-sixth-street, and soon a number of frame workshops
and stables were ablaze. The firemen began rapidly to arrive at the
scene of the destruction, and made a few vain efforts to plant their
apparatus for the extinction of the fire. The crowd, however, refused
to let them work, asserting, in positive terms, that they should not
extinguish the flames until the intended work of destruction had been
accomplished.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL LEE'S CAMPAIGN IN PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">We</hi> present our readers with a
carefully-prepared map of that part of Pennsylvania which has already
been made interesting and important by the several expeditions and
battles that have taken place therein. Should the war be prolonged, it
will doubtless again become the scene of momentous events. Our Map, it
will be seen, embraces Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, and
Washington, and points out very clearly the line between the Northern
and Southern States, called "Mason and Dixon's line." This line was
surveyed by Mason and Dixon during the last century, and became the
means of settling old and troublesome contests between the independent
nationalities which claimed jurisdiction under grants made by the
Crown to William Penn and Lord Baltimore. The circular line on the
north of the State of Delaware became the starting-point of the
survey. Beginning at this circle, ten miles from Newcastle, the survey
goes due west to a point near the Ohio River. Should the future
boundary of the Southern Confederacy, however, be fixed in accordance
with the wishes of the South, it will no doubt be made to follow the
Susquehannah River, and thence down the Ohio and up the Missouri and
the Platte.</p>
<p>It would be vain to speculate upon the motives which induced the
Confederate Government to order General Lee's advance north. Beyond
doubt, the difficulties of the task were underrated; and, after the
succession of reverses sustained by the army of the Potomac, President
Davis may well be excused for not having foreseen the gallant manner
in which it fought under the command of its new General, Meade. A
great object of the advance was, of course, to make the North feel
more acutely the burden of the war and to supply the army with food
and forage. But, beyond a doubt, more important results were expected,
and there is no ground for regarding the failure of General Lee's
campaign as anything less than a severe, if temporary, blow to the
cause he fights for.</p>
<p>General Lee effected his advance, which was over the extensive
rivers, mountain ranges, &#x0026;c., of some 165 miles of country, by
throwing forward cavalry forces on the east side of Bull Run mountains
to Leesburg and the Potomac, in order to clear the country of Federal
signal-stations; which, posted on the mountains, gave notice of his
movements. Lieutenant-General Ewell, the friend and successor of
Stonewall Jackson, then marched by a route in the rear of those
mountains, and, deflecting his course north and west, crossed the
Shenandoah River between Salem and Winchester, and fought General
Milroy at the latter place. General A. P. Hill followed, Longstreet
bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>Sufficient forces were left in and near Richmond to defend the
city against the formal advance of an army of 65,000 or 70,000 men;
but not enough to take the field and check the inroads of marauding
parties who might, therefore, approach almost within sight of the
city, and do damage to the railroads, &#x0026;c.</p>
<p>General Milroy was routed, and several thousand prisoners were
taken. The rest of his forces escaped by night, scattering over the
country and reaching Pennsylvania by various routes. General Ewell
thence crossed the Potomac River at several fords above Harper's Ferry
and below Williamsport. He steadily advanced, vi&#x00E2; Hagerstown,
Maryland, to Chambersburg and Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Bodies of cavalry were dispatched in every direction, destroying
Federal property, public bridges, railroads, &#x0026;c., but
respecting the persons and property of private citizens. General
Stuart's cavalry advanced to a bridge over the Baltimore and
Washington Railroad (the only rail connecting Washington with the
United States), at Beltsville, fourteen miles from Washington. He
destroyed the bridges of the Baltimore and Susquehannah Railroad,
connecting Baltimore with Harrisburg; ruined the track and bridges of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, connecting Washington and Baltimore
with the West, and compelled the Federals to burn bridges over the
Susquehannah River, to check his advance on Philadelphia, and
Harrisburg, one of which cost a million dollars. Besides this,
contributions on towns and cities were levied. In one case, £30,000
was exacted from the city of York. Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>When General Hooker left the Rappahannock, Longstreet advanced to
the Potomac; and when General Hooker crossed the Potomac Longstreet
was still in advance. General Lee, assuming that he could engage
Hooker with Longstreet's division, employed the corps of Ewell to open
the way to Pennsylvania. It was at this juncture that General Hooker,
with great sagacity, resigned his command.</p>
<p>The particulars of the battle of Gettysburg are still fresh in the
recollection of our readers. Although the forces of General Lee were
far inferior to those under the command of General Meade, he had the
advantage of handling veteran troops who had acquired confidence in
many a hard fought and victorious field. Against this advantage,
however, Meade had uudoubtedly the superiority of numbers and
position. The Federal army fought well and long, the battle raging for
three days. Upon the first day the combined forces of two of Lee's
Lieutenants--Generals A. P. Hill and Ewell--fell upon the advance of
Meade's army north-west of Gettysburg, and drove it back, with great
slaughter, some two miles and a half to the south of that town.</p>
<p>The second day there was a general engagement, extending over miles
of ground, and contesting the strong position to which General Meade
had fallen back, commanding all the roads and affording excellent
defensive works to the Federal army. On the third day,<pb n="156"/>
when fortune, long doubtful, seemed inclining to the Confederate arms,
two brigades of fresh troops arrived to reinforce General Meade, and
changed the fate of the day. Simultaneously with this General Lee
received advice that a large force of the enemy was about interrupting
his trains. He immediately fell back upon Hagerstown, and prepared
there to decide the great event of the war. It is impossible to say
what, but for General Lee's recall, might have happened. Much might
have been expected from the Confederate General's skill, and the
character of his troops; but, on the other hand, his position was not
altogether favourable. Meade was advancing from the south-east;
another corps neared him along the banks of the Susquehannah, from the
east; a small division advanced upon him from the west, and all the
Federal forces that had collected at Harper's Ferry were pouring in
from the south. Meanwhile, a large force of cavalry hung upon his
rear, taking up the stragglers, sick, &#x0026;c., of his army. But at
this juncture the Confederate Government, alarmed by the fall of
Vicksburg and the threatened attack on Charleston, recalled him,
purposing, it is said, to entrust to Lee the management of the
important movements rendered necessary in the west and south. And so
ended the second Confederate campaign in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>As this region, however, may hereafter become interesting, either
by future battles or treaties, we append the following facts
concerning the principal towns.</p>
<p>Pittsburg and Philadelphia are connected by one of the finest
railroads in the world. It is somewhat less than four hundred miles in
length, and the journey is made in about fourteen hours. There are
eight lines of telegraph wire running the whole distance. Pittsburg is
the Birmingham of America. It is exceedingly wealthy. A quarter of a
century ago its <hi rend="italic">&#x00E9;lite</hi> used gold forks,
spoons, &#x0026;c. Iron, coal, glass, steel, copper, kerosine oil,
pottery, cotton, woollen goods, ships, &#x0026;c., are made there to
an enormous extent. The Map shows its situation between two navigable
rivers and at the head of a third, which is navigable for large
vessels for one thousand miles down to the Mississippi River, and
thence up and down one thousand miles each way. The city is surrounded
and commanded by hills, some 300 ft. high, which are now being
fortified. General Braddock, an English General of last century, was
killed at "Braddock's field," twelve miles from Pittsburg, on the
north bank of Monongahela River.</p>
<p>Philadelphia lies between the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, on a
fine large plain, about two miles and a half broad, connected with
suburbs suburbs over the rivers by six first-class stone and iron
bridges, and some twenty-five steam-ferries. The population, before
the war, was about two-thirds of a million.</p>
<p>Harrisburg is the seat of Government of Pennsylvania, and quite a 
populous city. The Susquehannah River is not fordable, and is crossed 
by several large and expensive bridges, one of which is nearly one
mile in length. The country around is very productive.</p>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland, is a city of nearly 200,000 people, the
majority of whom are opposed to the Federal Government. Washington,
the Federal capital, is very strongly defended by bastioned works and
a sufficient force of well-disciplined men. Its inhabitants are in
favour of the Confederate Government. The people of Eastern Maryland
and the region around Washington are Southern, those west of Frederick
are generally Northern, in their sympathies. Delaware is divided in
sentiment.</p>
<p>The plans which we append of Pittsburg and the fortifications of
Washington will speak for themselves.</p></div2>

<p>...For the moment public interest everywhere is concentrated on the
affairs of Mexico. In considering the events of something less than a
year in that region of the western hemisphere, we almost recognise a
revival of the times of Cortez and Pizarro, and are reminded of our
own raid into India under Clive. A handful of armed Frenchmen, under a
General who is supposed to be a soldier and nothing else, have, not
without difficulty but in the end triumphantly, subdued a country
larger than France, and probably, as the result of something like an
order of the day from Marshal Forey, an empire has been established on
the ruins of a rickety republic, and an Austrian Archduke proclaimed
Emperor. Those who claimed to be well informed as to the policy of
France in regard to Mexico have asserted that the proclamation of the
empire and the choice of the Archduke Maximilian were by no means the
desired sequence. It was supposed that the Archduke would decline the
proffered Imperial Crown; and then, the whole responsibility being
cast upon France, there could remain only that alternative which was
provided in such a case--the nomination of a Sovereign as the occupant
of the new throne by Louis Napoleon. Practically, this meant the
selection of a cadet of the House of Buonaparte; the permanent
occupation of Mexico by a French army; and, in reality, the
establishment in that country of a French protectorate, political as
well as physical. In short, Mexico would have become a distant
province of France under a vicegerent, who would be called an
Emperor. But all these speculations have been set at nought by the
fact that the Archduke has accepted the crown which has been offered
to him. This alters the whole state of affairs. It is impossible that
the brother of the Emperor of Austria can consent to be maintained on
his throne by French bayonets. If, as seems to be certain, bayonets
are to be the props of the Mexican empire, they should, and must be,
Austrian, and not French. At once Austria, through one of her Imperial
family, becomes the ostensible arbiter of the destinies of a new
addition to the Powers of the world, which, by a curious complication,
she can influence only under French inspiration. Mexico is a present
from France to Austria, and must represent a close alliance between
those two Powers in Europe--a scheme of polity which is not new in the
ideas of Bonapartism.</p>
<p>Beyond this we think we see a design on the part of France to
relieve herself from what might have been a great difficulty. The
occupation of Mexico by the French, and the conversion of that country
into a dependency of France, might have been resented in due time by
the Federal States of America. If, as has been hinted, the new
Franco-Mexican Empire had entered into an alliance, offensive and
defensive, with the Confederate States, the rupture between France and
the Northern States would have been complete. It may be that Louis
Napoleon is not prepared for war with the North, even in conjunction
with the South; and, therefore, if Mexico becomes ostensibly Austrian
instead of French, this danger may be averted for the present, Whether
America, South or North, will eventually allow a European dynasty and
Government to be established in Mexico remains to be seen. In truth,
there lies more peril to quiet enjoyment of a Mexican empire from the
Southern than from the Northern States; for, when the latter establish
their independence, the extention of their territory to the Gulf is
inevitably upon the cards....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from New York to the evening of the 1st inst. It is
varied and interesting, though not of great importance.</p>
<p>General Lee "escaped," as the Northern journals described it, out
of the Shenandoah Valley, and passed through Chester Gap to the east
side of the Blue Ridge. On his march his rear was attacked by the
Federals and 1200 cattle were lifted. The armies of Lee and Meade,
after much marching and countermarching, have reoccupied the district
in which they were established previous to the Confederate invasion of
Maryland and Pennsylvania. The army of the Potomac is once more on the
Rappahannock, in the vicnity, of Falmouth, and the Confederate forces
have assumed a defensive<pb n="159"/> position on the old, well-fought
ground between Culpepper and Gordonsville. The Federals have, it is
stated, seized the heights in the rear of Fredericksburg. General Lee
officially denies General Meade's report of having captured a brigade
of infantry and two pieces of artillery as Lee was retiring across the
Potomac "The enemy (he says) did not capture any organised body of men
on that occasion, but only stragglers and such as were left asleep on
the road, exhausted by the fatigue and exposure of one of the most
inclement nights I have ever known at this season of the year. No
arms, cannon, or prisoners were taken by the enemy in battle, but only
such as were of necessity left behind."</p>
<p>It is officially announced that the famous Confederate partisan
leader General Morgan has been captured in Ohio, with several of his
officers and about 400 of his troopers.</p>
<p>A body of 2,500 Confederates, under Pegram and Scott, crossed the
Kentucky River, but were attacked at Paris and repulsed, after severe
fighting. Martial law was proclaimed in Kentucky, in consequence of
the invasion of that State by the Confederates. The latter were beaten
at Winchester, and driven towards the Cumberland River.</p>
<p>In the West Rosencranz, a Federal leader, was organising his forces
to attack Atalanta, for the defence of which important place and the
railway to Chattanooga great preparations were in progress. A rumour
was afloat that Rosencranz had captured Chattanooga on the 16th of
July; but the information on which it rests is not mentioned, and
later dates represent the city as still in possession of the
Confederates. It is certain that Brashear City had been taken
possession of by the Federals. Grant's army was, however, falling back
on the Big Black River; and Johnston, said to have been reinforced by
Bragg, was thought to intend making the Mobile and Ohio Railway, from
Okalona on the north to Mobile on the south, his line of
defence. Federal General Herran's division had left Vicksburg for
Mobile.</p>
<p>At Charleston, the persistent attacks of the Federals had still
been repulsed. On the 18th ult. Fort Wagner, after havingbeen
bombarded, was stormed; but the assault was thrown back with heavy
slaughter--Confederate accounts say 2000 killed and wounded. A week
subsequently James Island was abandoned by the Federals as
untenable. On the 24th and 25th the bombardment of Wagner was
renewed, with what result is not stated; and the Federals had
strenghtened their position on Morris Island. We learn by telegraph to
Farther Point, on the evening of the 1st inst., that General Gilmore
has abandoned for the present the notion of taking Fort Wagner, the
shells making but a slight impression upon the sand of which the fort
is composed. General Gilmore is said to be confident that his
siege-guns will reach Fort Sumter.</p>
<p>The details of the proceedings in Charleston Harbour on the 26th of
July are epitomised as follows by the <hi rend="italic">New York
World</hi>:--"Our military and naval forces were still engaged in the
siege of Fort Wagner, and everything was going on favourably. General
Gilmore had succeeded in erecting a heavy battery of siege-guns, each
weighing twenty tons, within 1000 yards of Fort Wagner. Fort Sumter
and Fort Johnson, on James Island, kept up a continual fire on the
Federal forces on Morris Island, but with little effect, our
casualties averaging only about six a day. The assault on Fort Wagner
failed, it is said, for the want of daylight. The ironclads kept up a
steady fire till our troops reached the fort, the rebels meanwhile
hiding under bombproofs. The instant the vessels ceased firing they
were hurriedly formed for battle, and our soldiers, as they entered,
were mown down by whole companies at a time by the concentrated fire
of the 2500 rebels within the fort. Darkness coming on, friend could
not be distinguished from foe, and our forces were compelled to
retire."</p>
<p>The Provost Marshal General had ordered the draught in New York to
be carried out, and the 3rd was mentioned as the day for its
resumption. A bitter controversy continues between the Republican and
the Democratic press concerning the constitutionality and policy of
enforcing the draught; also between the State and Federal officials
who were engaged in quelling the late riots. The Mayor of New York,
Major Opdyke, had vetoed the City Council's appropriation of money for
draughted men.</p>
<p>The following is from the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi>,
Mr. Davis's own organ:--"Riot, murder and conflagration have begun in
New York. It is a world's wonder that this good work, did not commence
long ago; and this excellent outbreak may be the opening scene of the
inevitable revolution which is to tear to pieces that most rotten
society and leave the Northern half of the old American Union a desert
of blood-soaked ashes. We bid it good speed. The news is cheering to
us, indeed, because it portends the breaking down of the whole
structure of Yankee society. Yet the process may be long; and in the
meantime the desperate energy of their war for the conquest of the
Confederacy may grow more furious for a season. No matter; we can at
least now see to the end of it. This one insurrection may be
suppressed for the moment, but it will be the parent of other and
still worse convulsions. Yet a little while, and we shall see the
giant but hollow bulk of the Yankee nation bursting into fragments,
and rushing down into perdition in flames and blood. Amen."</p>
<p>Not the least significant feature of the American struggle is the
receipt of letters from a new special correspondent of the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi>, who writes after this fashion:--</p>
<p><q>The South has been wearied out and used up, if not
conquered. The Federals may meet more than repulse at Charleston; but
so they did at Fort Donelson, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, and all
these strongholds ended by falling into their hands. A cause that
shelters behind walls and trenches may be looked upon as hopeless. The
Mississippi is lost, and Jackson, Mobile, and most of the Southern
cities, with Charleston and Richmond itself, are likely--are sure--to
follow. Lee alone is the Southern tower of strength, and we incline to
think him still unbroken; and so long as he holds his ground he is
fully a match--more then a match--for the adversary he has now in
front. But vast forces are said to be moving from the West to the
South-West. Grant, Rosencranz, and other leaders, elated with recent
success, are expected to breathe a new spirit into the councils of the
irresolute Meade, and to infuse fresh blood into the sluggish army of
the Potomac. Before the contending parties are again likely to venture
on a decisive contest, it is confidently asserted that the Northerners
will be more than two to one against the Secessionists.</q></p>
<p>President Davis has issued the subjoined proclamation, urging the
people to receive in thankfulness the lesson taught them in the
recent reverses, and appointing Aug. 21 as a day of fasting and
prayer:--</p>
<p><q>Again do I call upon the people of the Confederacy--people who
believe that the Lord reigneth, and His overruling Providence ordereth
all things--to unite in prayer and humble submission under his
chastening hand, and beseech His favour on our suffering country. It
is meet that when trials and reverses befall us we should seek to take
home to our hearts and consciences the lessons which they teach, and
profit by the self-examination for which they prepare us. Had not our
success on on land and sea made us self-confident and forgetful of our
reliance on Him? Had not the love of lucre eaten like a gangrene into
the very heart of the land, converting too many of us into worshippers
of gain and rendering them unmindful of their duty to their country,
to their fellow-men, and to their God. Who, then, will presume to
complain that we have been chastened, or to despair of our just cause
and the protection of our Heavenly Father? Let us rather receive in
humble thankfulness the lesson which He has taught in our recent
reverses, devoutly acknowledging that to Him, and not to our own
feeble aims, is due the honour and the glory of victory; that from
Him, in His paternal providence, come the anguish and sufferings of
defeat; our humble supplications are due to His footstool. Now,
therefore, I, Jefferson Davis, President of these Confederate States,
do issue this my proclamation, setting apart Friday, the 21st day of
August ensuing, as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer; and I do
hereby invite the people of the Confederate States to repair, on that
day, to their respective places of public worship, and to unite in
supplication for the favour and protection of that God who has
hitherto conducted us safely through all the dangers that environed
us. In faith whereof I have hereunto set my hand and the seal of the
Confederate States, at Richmond, this 25th day of July, in the year of
our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three.</q></p>
<p>Mr. Stephens, Vice-President of the Southern States, was making a
tour of the Confederacy. On the 17th ult., he made a speech at
Charlotte, North Carolina, in which he expressed confidence in the
military genius of General Lee, and declared that the South had
previously sustained more serious blows than the fall of Vicksburg and
Port Hudson. Final and complete separation from the North was, he
said, the only terms on which peace could be secured, and rather than
submit to anything short of that they would all, he trusted, "die like
men worthy of freedom."</p>
<p>The southern journals, although acknowledging the late reverses,
appear still confident of the ultimate independence of the South.</p>
<p>Among the items of intelligence are the announcement of the death
of Mr. Crittenden, the author of the famous "Crittenden compromise,"
and the statement that the library and papers of President Davis had
been seized at Jackson, Mississippi, by the Federals.</p>
<p>Another item of news, most important if true, is that President 
Davis has propose an offensive and defensive alliance to Louis
Napoleon, who is tempted with the acknowledgment by the Confederate
Government of the French Protectorate in Mexico and a modeification
of the "domestic institution."</p>
<p>Both the <hi rend="italic">New york Herald</hi> and <hi
rend="italic">Tribune</hi> concur in stating that the Federal
Government has notifed England that the sailing of privateers from
English ports will be considered an unfriendly act.</p>
<p>The United States' District court has condemned the cargoes of the
steamers Peterhoff, Springbok, Gertrude, and Liorvi.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant and important piece of news by the
last arrival is a recommendation of the Southern journals that, if the
decision in the case of the Alexandra be affirmed in England, the
Confederates should promptly avail themselves of it to give a
deathblow to Northern commerce and strike some Northern cities.</p>
<p>The Confederate cruiser Florida was at Bermuda repairing and taking
in coal from a Confederate vessel, a supply of that article having
been refused by the authorities. It was asserted that she had, since
June 18, destroyed twelve vessels, and that she had transferred
500,000 dols. in silver bars to a steamer bound for Wilmington.</p>
<p>The Federal cruisers are making sad havoc among the steamers and
sailing-vessels engaged in running the blockade. Intelligence was
received on Monday at Liverpool of the capture of the Confederate
blockade-runners Emma, Merrimac, Lizzie, Kate Dale, Kate, and the
destruction of the Racoon, by the Federal cruisers off Charleston,
while attempting to run the blockade. The Merrimac was captured by the
gun-boat Iroquois, on the morning of the 25th ult., after a chase of
seven hours, having run the blockade of Wilmington on the previous
night. The Merrimac is a side-wheel steamer of 535 tons and 600-horse
power, and was build in London in 1862 for the Confederate
Government. At the time of her capture she had on board 576 bales of
cotton and 34 half bales, eleven casks of tobacco, and a large
quantity of turpentine, &#x0026;c. The Lizzie was captured on the l5th
ult., after a chase of two hours, by the Santiago de Cuba, while
attempting to run into Wilmington. Her cargo consisted of brandy, dry
goods, provisions, &#x0026;c. The Emma was captured on the 24th
ult. by the United States' transport Arago. The Emma was loaded with
cotton, resin, turpentine, and tobacco, and was commanded by Captain
Leslie, a half-pay British naval officer. Although the Arago was only
a transport, and had not a gun on board, yet the Emma surrendered
without a shot being fired. The Emma was owned in London by Hart and
Tennett. The Racoon, one of Frazer and Trenholme's blockade-breaking
fleet, was chased ashore while trying to run into Charleston, and
completely destroyed by a Federal gunboat.</p></div2>

<p>the following description of a "battery" recently launched for the
Federal service is given in the <hi rend="italic">NeW York
Times</hi>:--"The Onondaga is constructed wholly of iron. The hull is
227 ft. 6 in. in length and 48 ft. in width. The frames are of angle
iron, 5 in. by 3 in. rivetted to a central plate at the bottom. There
is no keel, properly speaking, but a ribbed or arched plating in the
place of it, to which all the frames are joined. The lines of the thip
are very easy forward and aft presenting much less resistance than
some other ironclads now afloat. There are no projecting armour
shelves on the sides, but the vessel is protected from shot by single
plates 4 &#x00BD; in. in thickness, bolted directly to the hull. There
is no wooden backing of any kind to support this armour, but inboard
there is a series of iron knees or angle pieces, secured to the deck
and hull, which strengthen it materially and enable the weight
outboard to be carried without straining the ship or making her liable
to leakage. The draught of water will be 10 ft.; the rate of speed is
not known yet. There are two propellers or screws, one on each side
under the stern, each propeller being driven by two engines. The
turrets are the same as those upon all the Monitors--11 in. thick in
the walls, 9 ft. high, and 21 ft. in diameter inside. There are two
15-inch guns in each turret. The quarters for the officers generally
are aft, although some of them--the engineers, for example--have
accommodations forward. A great part of the storeage is also aft,
including the magazine and spirit-room. Neither the bow nor stern of
the Onondaga overhangs the hull, the stern projecting only enough to
cover the screws and protect them from damage by shot. There are
thirteen transverse water-tight compartments, and the coal-bunkers
surround the boilers in addition to the protection afforded by the
iron plating."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">The</hi> disturbances on Monday, July 13--the
first day of the outbreak in New York--culminated in an outrage which
fitly crowned the day's excesses. The Coloured Orphan Asylum, a large
plain building situated in Fifth-avenue, was fired about five o'clock
in the afternoon. The infuriated mob, eager for any outrage, were
turned that way by the simple suggestion that the building was full of
coloured children. A few policemen who attempted to make a stand were
instantly overpowered, several being severely or fatally
injured. While this was going on a few of the less evil-disposed gave
notice to the inmates to quit the building. The sight of the helpless
creatures stayed for a moment even the insensate mob; but the orphans
were no sooner out than the work of demolition commenced. First the
main building was gutted and then set on fire. While it was burning
the large wing adjoining, used as a dormitory, was stripped inside and
out. The fire-engines were there in great numbers, but were not
permitted to work, except upon the adjacent buildings. Eyewitnesses of
the dastardly outrage state that they saw scores of half-intoxicated
Irishwomen, staggering along under burdens of bedding and clothing,
shrieking as they reeled along, "Hooray for Jeff. Davis!" "Death to
the Naygurs!"</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Conflict Between The Rioters And

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Avenue.</hi></p>
<p>A messenger brought information to the 7th Regiment armoury, at six
o'clock on Wednesday evening, July 15, that the mob was in great
strength in First-avenue, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth streets,
apparently organising, preparatory to moving on a marauding
expedition. Colonel Winslow, of the 5th Regiment (Duryea Zouaves),
then in command at the armoury, immediately ordered a detachment of
volunteers under arms. The locality abounds in tenement houses, where
the class of persons live of which the mob is composed, and into these
buildings the mass of the rioters took refuge on the appearance of the
soldiers. From the roof and windows of every house the mob at once
opened an attack, delivering a brisk and persistent fire upon the
military of musketry and pistols as well as a volley of bricks and
other missiles. To this assault the soldiers replied, and the
howitzers raked the avenue up and down with canister, of which ten
rounds were discharged. It is estimated that this fire killed as many
as thirty persons, and the effect was a partial dispersion of the
rioters, although some of the more bold among them lurked behind the
corners of the buildings, whence they would sally out, discharge their
guns, and again go to cover. The infantry force, meantime, although
un-uniformed, and just enrolled for the emergency, stood gallantly up
to the work, loading with rapidity and firing with precision at the
rioters wherever they showed themselves--at window, or upon roof, or
at the street corners. The mob in this instance, however, clearly had
the small force of soldiers at an advantage. Colonel Winslow had not
men enough to make a charge upon the buildings, and as many as ten of
his little command, after twenty minutes' fighting, had already
fallen, several of them being killed outright. He reluctantly,
therefore, ordered a retreat, which was conducted with veteran
coolness, not withstanding the fact that, as the soldiers marched
through Nineteenth-street, they were followed for some distance by the
howling mob, who were left masters of the field.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE REVOLUTION IN THE FEDERAL</p>
<p rend="center">STATES.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">At</hi> the very outburst of the great civil
war in America it was predicted that the attempt of the North to
subjugate the South--whatever might be its effect upon the seceding
States--would inevitably lead to the overthrow of Northern liberty. A
huge debt, an immense standing army, and, a centralised Government
were all necessary to the prosecution of a scheme so stupendous; and
that the Republican freedom of which the Americans were always so
ready to boast could coexist with these was so manifestly impossible
that the best friends of the North were those who most earnestly
deprecated the war. But the desire of the Northern people for the
unity of the Republic--to be maintained at all hazards and at any
sacrifice--was then, and is now, so passionately unreasonable as to
have blinded them to an the consequences of the struggle--consequences
alike fatal to the real dignity, greatness, and happiness of the
North, whether it fail or succeed in its object. Twenty years ago,
when the disruption of the Union was publicly discussed, as not only
among the probabilities but the certainties of the future, the most
eminent Americans of both sections were of opinion, not only that the
separation would be peaceably effected--like the dissolution of a
partnership that has ceased to be either agreeable or profitable--but
that it would be for the advantage of all concerned. The South
imagined that it could successfully carry on a system of government
based upon the patriarchal model; and, while enriching itself and
taking care of its negroes, solve the problem of labour without
entailing the chronic pauperism that curses it in the old world, where
the aged and worn-out labourer has no claims upon those who employed
him while he was young and strong. The North, on the other hand, not
only looked upon disruption without disfavour, but continually
threatened it, in order by that means to free itself from the stigma
of the slavery which it had neither the right nor the power to
abolish. So recently as the election of Mr. Lincoln the best minds in
the North were of this opinion. Even Mr. Seward--all his life an
opponent of slavery--proclaimed officially, as Secretary of State, in
circulars to his Ambassadors to be communicated to foreign Powers,
that coercion of the South was a policy alike suicidal and
unconstitutional. Mr. Everett, formerly Minister to the Court of
St. James', declared the same sentiments. Mr. Horace Greeley, of the
<hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, one of the ablest and most honest
leaders of the Abolitionist and Republican party, was in favour of
letting the South depart peaceably, as the best means of restoring the
purity of the flag which, while it was a flag that protected slavery,
he had declared to be "a flaunting lie" and "a polluted rag," unworthy
to be unfurled in the free sunshine. Had this prudent course been
adopted the North would have escaped a mountain of debt and a national
bankruptcy, a standing army, which will of necessity trample out its
liberties, and that maximised form of Government which is but another
name for despotism. Possibly, to, if this policy of masterly
inactivity had been pursued, the South, after a short probation of
independence, might have found it to be its interest, for commercial
and other reasons, to sue for readmission into the federation from
which it had withdrawn; and the Union would have been restored
without the enkindling of hateful passions, or the shedding of a
single drop of blood.</p>
<p>But this was not to be. A whirlwind of excitement arose. The
Northern people were carried away by it, and nothing would satisfy
them but the subjugation of their brothers. One by one, the prudent
statesmen, such as Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Seward, Mr. Everett, Mr. Greeley,
and others, became infected with the madness of the crowd. The voice
of Reason was silenced. The sword was made the arbiter of questions
that no sword can decide. Battle succeeded battle, with no other
result than the slaughter of hecatombs on both sides,--battles that
settled nothing, and only proved the martial valour of both
peoples. And what a scandal it was that two such brave combatants
should not have learned that the subjugation of either was
impossible. For two years the North has been in <hi
rend="italic">impasse</hi>. Sometimes losing, sometimes winning, it is
at this moment as far off as ever from the accomplishment of its
designs. The South, with no advantage except that of "immortal
hate"--which is a better provocative<pb n="182"/> of valour than all
the wealth and bounty-money in the world--has maintained the contest
with a heroism that has carried men's hearts captive with admiration;
and the North, with everything on its side,--riches, numbers, command
of the sea, and possession of the legitimate Government--finds itself
engaged in an undertaking which all the true friends of liberty in
every part of the civilised earth, except in Washington, consider to
be utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>But, while the North has done little or nothing to and the war, it
has done much to end its own liberty. The Government established by
George Washington has ceased to exist. The Constitution founded by the
Fathers of the Republic has been abrogated on the plea of military
necessity, and can never again be restored. Mr. Buchanan was the last
President of the United States. Mr. Lincoln is the President of a
geographical division, and of a sectional party even in that. Martial
law prevails everywhere except in New York, New Jersey, the six little
States of New England--and remote California, too distant to suffer by
or take any interest in the illogical and murderous conflict. In all
other portions of the broad domain the discretion of a Provost
Marshal, or a blundering dragoon suddenly converted into a Dictator,
supersedes all law. The Courts are powerless. The press is under a
surveillance stricter than that of France or Austria. Men are torn
from their beds at midnight and consigned to military prisons, without
the intervention of judge or jury or the specification of any real or
supposed offence, In contravention of the fundamental laws of the
Federation and of every State that comprises it, a forcible
conscription of the young men has been ordered; and the project of the
utter destruction of the sovereign rights of the States--the abolition
of local Parliaments and their reduction to the position of English
counties or French departments, is openly avowed by the organs of the
Administration, and strenuously advocated as the only means of
preventing a new secession and the breaking up of the North and West
into half a dozen or more Republics. The public debt is known to
amount to 400 millions of pounds sterling, and is suspected, on
sufficient reason, to be 50 per cent in excess of this frightful
sum. Everywhere are to be found the elements of disorder and anarchy;
and everywhere the easy-going people, the sordid traders, the
merchants, the professional men--everybody, in fact, who desires to
grow rich in a country where nothing but wealth is held in esteem,
where public virtue is a scoff and genius the target of contemptuous
unpopularity--are calling out for a "King Government" as the one thing
needful. The "King Government" will come. The way is prepared for
it. The new election for President will be the election of a dictator,
carried on, perhaps, under the forms of the law, but with armed
soldiers at every polling-place, to take care that the choice of the
soldiers be, or seem to be, the choice of the people. One thing,
perhaps, might even yet save the liberties of the Northern
people--peace and a commercial alliance with the South. But the
Government, in generosity as in intellect, is powerless to make the
offer. There is no man of sufficient intellect, honesty, and courage
in the Administration even to suggest such a solution to an otherwise
insoluble difficulty. The President is as obstinate as a Stuart, and
as conceited as a Bourbon. He learns nothing from experience, and has
neither the sense to see the right, nor the courage to do it. Nor is
there a single man in his councils more sagacious or more patriotic
than himself. Alas, poor America!</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Federal army of the Potomac has not made any movements of
importance. Skirmishes between the Federals and Confederates are,
however, of daily occurrence. On the 1st of August a considerable
force of Federal cavalry, under General Buford, crossed the
Rappanannock, and encountered the Confederates under General Stuart,
when considerable slaughter took place. The advantage remained with
the latter, Buford's forces being compelled to beat a retreat. It is
stated that Longstreet has taken possession of the heights behind
Fredericksburg once more; and that Lee's army, with the exception of
Hill's corps, is south of the Rapidan. This movement from Culpepper
appears to have been caused by General Meade crossing the Rappahannock
at Kelly's Ford, which would endanger Lee's retreat to Richmond; and,
supposing a part of his army to be with Longstreet at Fredericksburg,
he would incur the risk of being defeated in detail. General Meade's
pickets extend two miles and a half beyond the south bank of the
Rappahannock. The railroad bridge across the river at Rappahannock
station has been rebuilt. The Baltimore correspondent of the <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that by the middle of August
General Lee's army will be reinforced to the number of 130,000 men,
with 300 pieces of artillery, and, if by that time Meade has not
advanced, Lee will assume the offensive and move from Fredericksburg
direct on Alexandria by way of Bank's Ford, Dumfries, Occoquan, or
else by way of Manassas Junction, Centreville, and Fairfax, to
Arlington Heights. Meantime, General Meade has been reinforced by
15,000 men from Grants army.</p>
<p>The latest intelligence received from Charleston was to the 4th,
when the siege was still progressing. The Federal steamer Ironsides
was within 500 yards of Fort Sumter, and Gilmore's batteries were
expected to open fire from Morris Island in a few days. It is reported
that the batteries being erected by General Gilmore on Morris Island
are of such calibre that Fort Sumter cannot stand before them an hour
and a half after the fire is opened. The Confederates in Fort Wagner
made a sortie, but were driven back, with heavy loss. A letter from
Charleston, published in the <hi rend="italic">Boston Traveller</hi>,
confirms the statement that the Confederate shot pierced the plating
in the decks of the Monitors. Three of these shots struck the Nahant
during the recent attack upon Fort Wagner, and considerably damaged
that vessel.</p>
<p>Several of the New York rioters have been tried and convicted, and
sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from three to fifteen
years. The claims put in for compensation for property destroyed
amount, up to the present time, to 1,092,309 dols. The New York
Democratic State Convention has been called to assemble at Albany on
Sept. 9. A proposal is to be brought before the New York Chamber of
Commerce for the construction of a ship canal to the west, by way of
the Chanub and Champlain canals, for the purpose of throwing the
commerce of the north-west and Canada through the State of New
York. The Governor of New York supported the scheme.</p>
<p>The draught in Washington has been completed. It gives an aggregate
of 3700 whites and 1250 coloured conscripts. Guards have been placed
on all the roads and rivers leading from Washington in order to
prevent conscripts from escaping.</p>
<p>The Maine Democratic State Convention has passed strong resolutions
denouncing the course of the Lincoln Administration.</p>
<p>The national day of thanksgiving in commemoration of the Union
successes, kept on the 6th inst., in compliance with the President's
proclamation, was observed in Washington, New York, and other cities
by a general suspension of business and by religious services in the
various churches.</p>
<p>The possibility of a war with England forms the subject of an
article in the <hi rend="italic">Washington Republican</hi>, which is
described as a semi-official organ. We are accused of "injustice,
insolence, and outrage for a series of years," but retribution is
looming in the future. The first thing to be done on the outbreak of
hostilities would be the conversion of the steam marine of the
Northern States into privateers, and then, as a matter of course,
"British commerce would be driven from the ocean." The Government
have, however, repudiated this and similar statements of the
Republicans.</p>
<p>It seems that we are not in much better odour with the press of the
South than with that of the North. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond
Enquirer</hi> thinks it is the determination of the British
Government and people to do no act that shall tend to abridge war, or
help the South or involve itself in a quarrel with the United
States. "The South," it continues, "has no worse enemies than the
British Government; not that the British Government is a friend of the
North, but it hates the whole American people, and all their diplomacy will be to
prolong war by preventing the interference ot any other nation." The
<hi rend="italic">Examiner</hi>, however, thinks that Napoleon's
possesion of Mexico will render his interference compulsory whenever
it shall become evident that the Southern Confederacy shall cease to
exist without it, for the crown of Mexico will be untenable on the day
when the subjugation of the South shall be completed, and the United
States power restored.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Raleigh</hi> (North Carolina) <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>
denonunces President Davis's Government, and urges North Carolina to
send a delegation to Washington, to see what terms can be obtained,
without waiting for Davis. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi> urges President Davis
to suppress the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, and to wipe out the
North Carolina Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Federal prisoners now in Richmond number 4300, including 523
commissioned officers.</p>
<p>Considerable excitement exists in Columbus, Ohio, caused by invalid
soldiers tearing down flags inscribed with the names of Vallandigham
and Pugh. One soldier was nearly killed, and all the soldiers in the
city were confined to their barracks. Copperheads afterwards paraded
the streets and replaced the flags.</p>
<p>In Kentucky the Union ticket has been elected by a large
majority.</p>
<p>A collision has taken place between the "Copperheads" and the
"Union men" in Iowa. It is reported that the former number 4000,<pb
n="183"/> and are fully armed. The military have been despatched to
the scene of conflict.</p>
<p>From the Mississippi there is not much of importance, except the
reported routing of General Banks, with a loss of 600 men. At New
Orleans the Union Association had passed a resolution opposing the
organisation of the State Government under a Constitution recognising
slavery. For the purpose of keepng open the navigation of the
Mississippi, the Federal Government is understood to have determined
upon the organisation of an army of 100,000 negroes, and the President
has officially proclaimed that if the enemy enslave or sell any
captured black soldiers in the service of the United States, his
officers will adopt a policy of retaliation. For every Federal soldier
killed in violation of the laws of warfare a Confederate soldier will
he executed, and for every one enslaved or sold into slavery a
Confederate soldier will be placed at hard labour on public works, and
kept at labour until the other be released and receive the treatment
due to prisoners of war. The alleged wholesale slaughter of the negro
soldiers before Port Hudson is contradicted. There were engaged in the
siege of Port Hudson two regiments of coloured troops, numbering
together 1245 men. Of these, twenty-eight were killed, and 169 wounded
by gunshots and falling trees. General Grant's official despatch
states that during his operations in Mississippi he captured 39,000
prisoners, 31,000 of whom were paroled and 8000 sent North. Yazoo City
has been stripped in consequence of the hostile attitude of the
people. Quantities of merchandise and furniture and numbers of negroes
have been carried away. Earl Russell has sent to Lloyd's a
notification which he has received from Washington, in respect to the
navigation of the Mississippi. It is to the effect that vessels
trading to New Orleans and up the Mississippi will be convoyed between
New Orleans and Vicksburg by Federal gun-boats. The Confederate
Secretary of the Treasury has written a letter stating that, as the
fall of Port Hudson and Vicksburg exposes to the enemy the Government
cotton purchase in Mississippi and Louisiana, many planters will
probably leave their plantations. The military authorities will
therefore, he says, destroy all cotton they cannot preserve from the
enemy. The cotton will be destroyed only when there is imminent danger
of the enemy capturing it. No cotton has arrived at New Orleans since
the fall of Port Hudson.</p>
<p>President Davis has issued an address to the Confederate army, in
which he says:--</p>
<p><q>After two years of warfare the enemy continues a struggle in
which our final triumph must be inevitable. Unduly elated with recent
success, he imagines that temporary reverses can quell your spirit or
shake your determination, and now gathers heavy masses together for a
general invasion, vainly hoping that by desperate efforts success may
be reached. You know what the enemy means by success. His malignant
rage aims at nothing lees than the extermination of yourselves, your
wives, and children; to destroy what he cannot plunder, to partition
our homes as the spoils of victory, to incite servile insurrection,
and to debauch an inferior race hitherto contented by promising the
indulgence of the vilest passions as the price of treachery. Conscious
of their inability to prevail by legitimate means, and not caring to
make peace lest they should be hurled from power, the men now ruling
in Washington refuse even to confer on the subject of ending outrages
disgracing the age, or to listen to any suggestion for conducting the
war according to civilised usages. No alternative is left you but
victory or subjugation, and the utter ruin of yourselves, your
families, and your country. Victory is within your grasp. You need
but stretch forth your hands to grasp it. All that is necessary is,
that all should promptly repair to military duty; and I now grant a
general pardon and amnesty to all officers and men within the
Confederacy who may be absent without leave, and who shall without
delay return to their duty; but no excuse will be received for any
delay beyond twenty days after this this proclamation.</q>
President Davis finally conjures all the women of the Confederacy to
use their influence in aiding this call, and to take care that none
who owe duty in the field shall be sheltered at home.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is about to increase its naval force in the
Pacific.</p>
<p>A Federal war-steamer has sunk a vessel endeavouring to run out of
Charleston. It is supposed that her crew and a cargo of cotton are
lost.</p>
<p>Judge Betts, of the Marine Court, has condemned the steamer
Peterhoff and cargo. The ground given for her condemnation was that
"she was laden with contraband of war with the knowledge of the
owners; she was not truly destined to Matamoras for the purposes of
commerce within the authority of public laww, but to some other place
both in aid and for the use of the enemy, and in violation of the law
of nations; that the ship's papers were simulated, and false as to her
real destination." The schooner Stephen Hart, and the barque Sally
Magree have been condemned. The brig Isabella Thompson and her cargo
have been restored to the owners without damages or costs, and with
permission to the libellants to furnish further proof. The schooner
Glen and her cargo have been restored to the owners, with costs and
damages.</p>
<p>The steamer Ruth was burnt on the Mississippi during a voyage from
St. Louis to New Orleans; thirty lives were lost, together with a
large amount of Government funds in the hands of the paymaster on
board.</p>
<p>Captain Maffitt, of the Florida steamer, a Confederate cruiser, in
a letter to his family, published in the Southern journals, states
that to May 17 he had destroyed 10,000,000 dollars' worth of Northern
commerce, and had eluded thirteen Federal cruisers sent to capture his
vessel and the Alabama. He adds that the Alabama and Florida together
destroyed ten Federal vessels of the largest class on April 22 within
sixty miles of each other. A telegram from Queenstown states that the
Florida was off Kinsale on Monday. She put three passengers on board a
pilot-boat.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Most</hi>travellers agree in prounouncing the
American hotels to be the most perfect establishments of the kind ever
constructed--in fact, the Americans could never get on without

peculiarities are at first very distasteful to an Englishman who has
been used to the quiet, homelike comforts of the good old-fashioned
country inns; but in a short time the novelty wears off, and a hundred
advantages are discovered make them preferable to those of any other
country in the world. But this superiority only exists when the hotel
is a large and first-rate establishment, of which kind there are
several in every important city throughout the States, and one at
every point where great lines of traffic meet; but when the hotel is
of a second or third rate character it is most wretched, and often
dirty and disgusting, and to an Englishman positively
intolerable. There is an attempt to imitate the splendour and showy
appearance of a first-rate hotel without the completeness and fitness
of other portions--as, for instance, the walls of the dining-room may
be covered with a fine crimson and gold flock paper, while the tables
are of deal, on tressels, and the floor without carpet or any other
covering, filthily dirty. Similar unpleasant peculiarities will be
found throughout the house; for, unfortunately, cleanliness is not
considered by the proprietors of the smaller American hotels the first
element of comfort; but in such as the Fifth Avenue and the New York
Hotels, in New York, the accommodations and price at which it is
obtained, are not to be equalled elsewhere.</p>
<p>The charge at a first-class house is nearly the same throughout the
States. It is ten shillings per day, which includes breakfast,
luncheon, dinner, tea or supper, and separate bedroom, as well as all
charges for attendance of waiters chambermaids, and porters, and also
for cleaning boots. Wines, beer, and spirits are charged extra. The
dinner in either of the hotels in New York we have named is a positive
banquet, as everything the season produces is found upon the tables in
abundance, however expensive it may be to procure it. The other meals
are supplied on an equally liberal scale. Some of the finest hotels in
the United States are to be met with at those places where visitors
resort for the summer season, as at Saratoga and Niagara Falls. The
subject of our Illustration is an hotel in the neighbourhood of the
Falls, called Monteagle House. It is not one of the largest of the
kind, which are only opened during the season at the Falls, but
approaches more to the character of the railway hotels in England, it
being situated close to the suspension-bridge which connects the New
York Central Railway and the Great Western Railway of Canada together.
It is beautifully situated, close to the Niagara River, and has fine
views from its upper stories of the Great Falls and the surrounding
country, both in Canada and the United States.</p></div2>

<p>A letter from New York states that a cheap umbrella has just been
patented at Washington. It is made of brown paper, stretched upon
willow twigs, and is sold for ten cents. It is to be used exclusively
to lend to a friend, and will be called the "lending
umbrella."</p></div2>

<p>A suspicious-looking craft, believed to be an American privateer,
stopped the Vernon--with a mixed cargo and passengers--on her way home
from Sydney to England. A man, who represented himself to be a United
States' officer, but who was out of uniform and armed more like a
smuggler than a gentleman bearing a Government commission, boarded the
Vernon and demanded her papers. These were refused, and on leaving the
vessel the "officer" threatened to fire into her. The threat, however,
was not carried into effect.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CITY OF CHICAGO UNITED STATES.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">Extraordinary</hi> as has been the growth of
many such cities of the United States as Philadelphia in the east and
Cincinnati in the west, yet all are eclipsed by the rapidity with
which the great city of Chicago, the capital of the state of Illinois,
has risen up. Thirty years ago the site of this fine city was almost
of wilderness--not more than half a dozen cottages occupied the flat
prairie lands where now is a magnificent city containing one hundred
and twenty thousand inhabitants. Chicago is not composed of all kinds
of buildings, good, bad, and indifferant, as many American cities are,
but is beautifully built of brick and stone. The public buildings are
very fine, the streets wide and well paved. In fact, the city has as
noble and stately an appearance as any city of its kind in the Old
World. The shops and stores are of the first class and the hotels on
the largest scale, offering the best accommodation, particularly that
called the Briggs House, combining, as it does, the comfort of the
best English inns with those peculiar advantages that belong to the
American hotel system.</p>
<p>The geographical position of Chicago is, perhaps, the very finest
that exists on the American continent. It is situated on the
south-<pb n="204"/>west angle of Lake Michigan, quite in the "far
West" of the continent, more than a thousand miles from the Atlantic
Ocean. Yet vessels which shipped their cargoes in the docks of
Liverpool may often be seen discharging them beside her quays; and
many a cargo of corn, beef, and pork shipped in this great prairie
capital finds its way to British ports without ever being transhipped;
for between Chicago and the Atlantic the water communication is
complete for seagoing ships of considerable burden, by the Welland
Canal, which passes them from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, missing the
great Falls, and by the canals of the St. Lawrence, which avoid the
rapids of that river. Chicago is also connected with New York by a
grand system of canals; in fact, New York is the true port of the
prairie country.</p>
<p>From Chicago in every direction branches a system of railways of
the most complete kind. The Michigan Central enters the city on a
viaduct, across part of Lake Michigan. One of our Illustrations is
taken from a point on this viaduct. This railway is 300 miles long,
and extends to the city of Detroit, on the river which connects Lake
Huron with Lake Erie. On the opposite side of this river is the
British city of Windsor, the western terminus of a system of railways
connected with New York and Boston, and all portions of the British
territory in North America. From Chicago railways are increasing
northward and westward through the young States of Wisconsin, Iowa,
and Minnesota; while southward and westward railway communication is
perfect for thousands of miles into the farthest unbroken prairie
lands beyond the Missouri to the most southern States of the Union and
the mouths of the Mississippi and the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>It is impossible to contemplate the future of the North American
States without seeing that the city of Chicago must occupy the most
prominent position in it, standing as it does at the head of inland
navigation, and at the head also of those great alluvial tracts of
rich prairie lands, which even now are scarcely touched, lands where
soil, climate, and all desirable things else invite men to settle upon
them and progress. And it is not on the surface alone that these
riches exist, for beneath it lie inexhaustible beds of coal, and
limestone adapted for every purpose. Copper, lead, and other minerals
abound in the north; and there is a mountain of iron in the south. The
greatest nation the world has ever seen will be that which will one
day inhabit the plains of Illinois: Chicago will be its capital, and
New York its seaport.</p></div2>

<p>A long diplomatic correspondence between this country and the
United States has been published on the subject of the regulations
established by the Federal Government at the port of New York as to
vessels trading to the Bahamas. The correspondence originated in May
last year, when complaints were made by merchants and others in Nassau
that the Custom House at New York required shippers there for the
Bahamas to give bonds that none of the goods would be delivered at
Confederate ports, and this they complained of as an undue restriction
upon trade. It appeared that the restrictions were directed by an Act
of Congress of 1861. Earl Russell accordingly directed remonstrances
to be made against such restrictions, as violating the treaty of 1815
between this country and the United States, giving English ships
freedom to trade in American ports; and in August and September last
Lord Lyons remonstrated with Mr. Seward. Mr. Seward replied by
maintaining that the restrictions complained of were internal acts of
administration, applying equally to American and English ships, and he
pointed to the vast increase of the commerce of Nassau since the
outbreak of the war as a proof that the restrictions did not interfere
with the "legitimate" trade to that port. Earl Russell replied that
this was no answer to his complaint, and it was perfectly lawful for
British ships at Nassau to tranship their cargoes for American
ports. In his despatch, dated Dec. 17, he, however, expressed the
hope that, notwithstanding Mr. Seward's defence, the remonstrance
would have the practical effect of preventing the continuance or
repetition of similar proceedings. Mr. Seward rejoined on Jan. 9; but
at the close of his arguments he gave the assurance that the laws of
the United States would continue to be executed in such a way as to
afford no just ground for complaint of partiality or injustice. Earl
Russell, however, having discontinued the correspondence, hoping that
his remonstrances would have practical effect, wrote to Lord Lyons
again on the 18th of July, noticing the representation of
Messers. Tootal, Broadhurst, and Co., that such a bond had been
required of them when making a shipment to Nassau on the 15th of June
last. His Lordship considers this as a proof that the interference of
the United States authorities with the trade is still persisted in,
and instructs Lord Lyons to address a fresh remonstrance on the subject.</p></div2>
