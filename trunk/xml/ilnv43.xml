<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">CONFEDERATE INVASION OF THE
NORTH.</hi></p>
<p>The rumours which had for some time been current that General Lee's
army was about to act on the offensive were, it turns out, well
founded. The Confederate General has advanced with great rapidity
northwards, pushing a portion of his troops, consisting of cavalry and
mounted infantry, far forward, so as actually to enter the State of
Pennsylvania. General Lee's advance commenced on Saturday, the 18th
ult., and the total force with which he is making his combinations is
estimated to be but a little short of 100,000 men, of whom 30,000 are
said to be cavalry. They were divided into three bodies and seem to
have made but slight work of the opposition that was offered to their
advance.  At Winchester, General Milroy attempted to arrest their
progress, but the outworks which he had constructed were stormed, and,
after spiking his guns, he retired upon Harper's Ferry. An attempt was
made to cut off his retreat, but this he seems to have
surmounted with a loss of 2000 men, and eventually made good his way
to Harper's Ferry, to which point the Federals at Martinsburg and
Berryville also made their way in retreat. At one time, Harper's Ferry
was abandoned but the Federals have resumed possession of it. All this
was on the Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday morning the Confederates
had crossed the Potomac, and were at Hagerstown, in Maryland, with a large force, of which it was said 15,000 were
cavalry, divided into three columns of 5000 men each. On the
Tuesday they advanced to Greencastle, and then to Chambersburg, in
Pennsylvania, where, according to one report, a force of 2000
Confederates rested at twelve o'clock that night. The Nova Scotian
brings a few hours' later news to the evening of June 20, to the
effect that the Confederates had advanced to Centreville and defeated
the Federals there. Longstreet was threatening Leesburg, and Hill was
at Dumfries. On Thursday night, the 18th, the Confederates transported
their stores across the Potomac to Hagerstown, and it was said that
they intended to make it their headquarters for raids into
Pennsylvania. One important rumour is mentioned in the news brought by
the Nova Scotian. It is that the Unionists in Eastern Tennessee and
Western North Carolina had raised a powerful force to hold that region
against the Confederates.</p>
<p>At Harrisburg, the capital of Pennsylvania, distant but fifty miles
from Chambersburg, there was naturally consternation, and the State
archives and all public property of value were removed. The Governor
issued his call for troops for State defence, and the President united
in this by summoning 100,000 men to be mustered into the military
service of the United States to serve for six months. Of these, 50,000
are called for from Pennsylvania, 30,000 from Ohio, and 10,000 from
Maryland and West Virginia respectively. The volunteering for a short
period has been generally warmly supported, but in Pennsylvania it has
been necessary to assure the men that they were only called up to
resist invasion. New York has raised fourteen regiments in four days
for service in Pennsylvania, and Harrisburg and Pittsburg have both
been strongly fortified.</p>
<p>Hooker meanwhile has abandoned his position opposite
Fredericksburg, and is moving on a line parallel with that Lee has taken
northwards. His base at Acquia Creek is also abandoned, and his
supplies have been removed to Alexandria, his new base. At Warrenton,
about the same distance from Washington as Fredericksburg, a little
west of north of the latter place, he has his headquarters. Lee is
supposed to be at Front Royal, twenty-five miles north-west of
Warrenton.</p>
<p>It is a moment as critical as any in the war. As to Lee's plans
nothing, of course, is known--whether he will turn towards Western
Pennsylvania, supposing he eludes Hooker's main forces, or whether he
will direct his way eastward towards Baltimore or Philadelphia. Hooker
divined the intention of his adversary to make this advance, and had
for some time held his forces in instant readiness to follow. The
Government, too, made such preparation as they could by creating two
military departments for East and West  Pennsylvania and appointing
officers of high rank to command.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Richmond Threatened.</hi></p>
<p>On the Yorktown peninsula there are signs of Federal activity, as
we learn from Richmond accounts. The Federal gunboats have pushed up
the Chickahominy, within fifty miles of Richmond, and	a considerable
force is co-operating with them. General Keyes's command, which has
for some time been posted at West Point, has lately advanced to New
Kent Courthouse, about forty miles from the Virginian capital, and, in
face of those demonstrations, the Confederates have retired behind the
Chickahominy. It is said that Richmond is very strongly defended and
fully garrisoned.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Vicksburg.</hi></p>
<p>From Vicksburg we have news to the 18th ult., at which time affairs
were, according to Northern accounts, favourable to General Grant. The
Federals had pushed their approach within twenty yards of the bastion,
whilst Pemberton is said to receive reinforcements and supplies,
during the night, from the other side of the Mississippi. The Federals
yet hold possession of Black River Bridge, and their opponents are
declared to be at least thirty miles from the rear of Grant. One
despatch stations a body of Confederates, to the number of 5000, at
Jackson; another of 5000 at Yazoo City; and a third of 15,000 at
Canton. The Richmond papers state that General Johnstone had cut his
way through Grant's army, and that the siege would in consequence be
raised. This report, however, was not credited. The besieged appear to
be reduced to short rations.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General News.</hi></p>
<p>In Tennessee there are said to be signs of Confederate
movement. Contrary to the general opinion, Bragg has been reinforced,
whence is not stated, but he is believed to be about joining with
Buckner to invade Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Indiana enrolment excitement continues. A general
disinclination to submit to the draught is apparent all over the
country.</p>
<p>A military board has been appointed to settle this claims of
Generals Butler, Fremont, M'Clellan, Banks, and Dix for military
precedence of rank.</p>
<p>President Lincoln had sent a reply to the committee who forwarded
him the resolutions passed at the Albany Vallandigham meeting. The
President says that the ordinary law courts are inadequate to the
emergency. He continues:--" Military arrests and the suspension of the
Habeas Corpus Act are constitutional wherever public safety demands
it. Mr. Vallandigham was arrested by the military because he was
warring against the military, by labouring to prevent the raising of
troops and encouraging desertion." President Lincoln states that he
does not know whether, in his own discretion, he would have arrested
Mr. Vallandigham, but he thinks commanders in the field better judges
of particular cases. He will discharge Mr. Vallandigham as soon as he
can by any means believe that public safety will not suffer by it.</p>
<p>There are now about 30,000 coloured troops in the Federal army and
5000 coloured men in the Federal navy.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says:--"Since July,
1862, 57 steamers and 91 sailing-vessels left Nassau for the rebel
ports. Fifty-one of the former and 45 of the latter landed their
cargoes, affording immense aid to the rebels and realising vast sums
for the speculators. Forty-four steamers and 45 sailing-vessels
reached Nassau from the Confederacy during the same period."</p>
<p>The privateer Clarence, the tender of the Florida, has captured
seven brigs and schooners off Virginia Cape. The captain of the
Clarence transferred his guns to the barque Saxony, which he had
captured, and burned the Clarence. Twenty-five Federal vessels have
left Northern ports to capture the Saxony and the Coquette. The
privateer Japan has captured the ship Dictator.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>In answer to Lord Stratheden, Earl Russell said the French Ambassador had
called upon him that afternoon, and informed him that there was no truth in
the rumour that the French Government intended to make any communication
to her Majesty's Government in reference to mediation between the
Northern and Southern States of America.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Tuesday.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. Layard, in reply to Mr. Foster, stated that no communication
had been received tram the French Government since last autumn in
reference to interference in the American war.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Proposed Recognition of the
Confederate States.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Roebuck</hi> moved an address to the Crown,
praying that her Majesty would be graciously pleased to enter into
negotiations with the great Powers of Europe for the purpose of
obtaining their co-operation in the recognition of the independence of
the Confederate States of North America. He contended that the South,
by their gallant defence, and even by their victory over the North,
had earned a right to a recognition of their independence, and this on
every ground of international polity. Those States ought to be
acknowledged by England because it was their right, and also because
it was to the interest of England to do so in reference to the supply
of cotton, sugar, and tobacco to this country. The United States were
becoming the bullies of the world, and he would rejoice to see the
balance of power equalised on the American continent by the
reconstruction of the Union. He urged that the time had come for recognition by France and England, which
would put an end to the war. He stated that he was personally
authorised by the ruler of France to express his feelings on this
question, which were stronger than ever in favour of recognition of
the South; and he was assured by the Emperor himself that he had
desired Baron Gros to communicate that opinion to the English
Government, although this communication was not formal.	The Emperor
stated his reason for not making a formal communication, because his
despatch on the same subject on a former occasion had been sent by the English Government to the United States; but
he authorised him, (Mr. Roebuck) to state to the House that he was
prepared to act in all things with England, and especially in the
matter of the recognition of the Southern States. After this, what
excuse could be made by her Majesty's Government for not taking that
step?</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcap">B. Montagu</hi> moved as an amendment that the House earnestly desires
that an impartial neutrality should continue to be maintained by her
Majesty's Government during the present unhappy contest in the States
of North America.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Clifford</hi> supported the amendment.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcap">Chancellor</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcap">Exechquer</hi> objected to the motion in the first
place because it put into the hands of the House a function of the
executive Government; because it was at this moment especially
inconvenient, looking to the military situation of America while the
speech of Mr. Roebuck, couched as it was in a spirit of partisanship
for the South, was ill calculated to promote the object he had in
view. Recognition would not relieve Lancashire, and it was ill-advised
to lay down that as a doctrine when it was clear that this country, to
produce such results as were implied by Mr. Roebuck, could not stop at
recognition. Almost every man in England wished the war to come to a
close, but he denied that recognition would promote that end. There
was scarcely any case of recognition, pending a contest, which was not
followed by war in order to carry it cut. He contended that France and
England, situated as they were in reference to the States of America,
could not represent in the eyes of the world the principle of
impartiality in any interference between the contending parties.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">W. E. Forster</hi> urged that the motion,
if it meant anything, meant war--war to be waged for selfish
consideration; war which would be producttve of every possible
disaster to the commerce and the welfare of this country. In reference
to Mr. Roebuck's alleged communication to the House from the Emperor
of the French, he (Mr. Forster) deprecated the policy of joint action
with France, which inevitably led to war. A war with America, which
might and probably would ensue upon our intervention, would be one
against our kinsmen for slavery.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcap">R. Cecil</hi> argued that the conduct of the United States in cases of
recognition precluded them from objecting to the adoption of that course; and
he urged action in reference to the re-establishment of peace in the interests of
a large population of our own, which was desolate, owing to the failure of the
cotton supply.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Bright</hi> said that the motion, taken in
connection with Mr. Roebuck's character, his speech on this occasion,
and speeches elsewhere, might be taken as an address to the Crown
asking for a declaration of war, while he asked the House to accept
the lead of the Emperor of the French in this matter, a potentate in
whom not long ago he declared he had no faith. He contended that the
feeling which dictated this motion rested on a mean jealousy or a base
fear of America. He denied the power or the will of the United States
to act aggressively towards England or any other European nation, and
he protested against Mr. Roebuck raising a cry calculated to bring on
hostilities, between this country and a friendly nation, whilst he
would seek alliance for his country in a slaveholding State.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcap">G. Grey</hi>, in reference to a statement
by Mr. Roebuck of the readiness of the Emperor of the French to act in
conjunction with this country for the recognition of the South, stated
that no communication whatever on that point had been made to her
Majesty's Government.</p>
<p>The debate was adjourned to Thursday.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcap">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AMERICA.</hi>--Mr. W. E. Forster asked
Mr. Layard whether he could inform the House if it was true that
application was made some months ago that France should join England
in mediation between the Federal and Confederate States of
America.--Mr. <hi rend="smallcap">Layard</hi> denied the statements
made by Mr. Roebuck on a former evening, and said that no
communication had been made by Lord Lyons to Mr. Seward on the
subject.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate Invasion Of The
North.</hi></p>
<p>We have reports-not, however, very precise--of the movements of General
Lee to the 27th ult. This much seems certain, that a large portion
of the Confederate forces had passed into Pennsylvania and
Maryland, and that General Lee was endeavouring to isolate
Washington from the north and east as well as from the west. Thus far
General Lee has been enabled to carry out his plans without receiving
any material check. One division of General Lee's army is said to be
advancing to Budd's Ferry, fifteen miles below Washington, where,
with the aid of the pontoons the Confederates have carried with them,
the passage of the Potomac can, it is stated, easily be effected. This
division would probably march upon Fort Washington and re-establish
the batteries which formerly commanded the Lower Potomac and affected
the sea communications of the Federals. Another body of Confederates
first proceeded to Martinsburg, a town distant only a few miles from
Harper's Ferry, and thence they proceeded along the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad as far west as Cumberland, a part of Maryland which almost
unites Pennsylvania and Virginia, and is at the same time brought
near to Ohio by the great railway system of the Middle and Western
States. According to the Baltimore correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> General Lee was in strong force at Frederick City, Maryland, on
the 25th of June, and thence would either move on Washington or
Baltimore, or pass to the railroad between Washington and
Baltimore. General Hooker was also moving, and the right wing of his
army was said to be at Hagerstown.</p>
<p>So imminent is the peril that is supposed to menace Baltimore that the most urgent appeals are made to
the people by the Government, the Mayor of the city, the councils of
the military authorities, and the newspapers, to turn out to work on
the intrenchments which are being hastily erected for the defence of
the city, and to enlist in the various military organisations.</p>
<p>The despatches complain that there is universal indifference among the
people of Pennsylvania regarding the invasion. The <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that "the inhabitants seem to
have lost all spirit, and either retreat rapidly at the approach of
the Confederates or exhibit a strange apathy. Even the troops from New York or New Jersey are
not received with cordiality or enthusiasm, but the inhabitants
endeavour only to profit pecuniarily by their presence."</p>
<p>Immense mischief seems to have been done to the Northern cause by the
defeat and retreat of General Milroy from Winchester, that key of
the Shenandoah Valley which has so often changed owners during the
last three years. The Southerners claim to have captured from
Milroy 6500 prisoners, 2800 horses, 500 waggons, and stores to the
value of 2,000,000 dols.</p>
<p>The Washington correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi> gives the following summary of the Confederate strength
and movements:--</p>
<p><q>General Lee, for a week previous to moving from Culpepper in his last mysterious movement, gave orders, which
were stringently enforced, that no person, soldier or citizen, should
be allowed to enter or leave his lines. It is said that his army 
commenced to move on Saturday, and continued to pass through
Culpepper during all the intervening period up to Thursday of the
succeeding week. His force is said to have consisted of Ewell's corps
of 35,000 men, who marched out first, Longstreet's corps of 42,000
men, and Hill's corps of 28,000 men, who brought up the rear. General
Stuart's cavalry, 18,000 strong, protected the flank and rear,
while Jenkins, with 3000 men, accompanied Ewell into Maryland, the
destination of the main portion of the army. The artillery is said to
be in superb condition and very numerous. Stuart's command is said
to consist of six divisions of two brigades each, three regiments to
a brigade, and 500 men the average maximum number to a regiment. The
4th Virginia, the largest of all, on a recent review, numbered 714,
but every man that could be obtained was present on this
occasion.</q></p>
<p>The following are other fragments of news telegraphed on the dates
given:--</p>
<p><q>New York, June 26.--The Confederates under General Jones, with
cavalry and artillery, have, after a severe skirmish, driven the Federals
under Milroy out of Macconnellsburg and occupied that place. The
Federals have evacuated Carlisle, and fallen back to Harrisburg. The
Confederate advance in Pennsylvania is said to be 10,000 strong. The
Governor of Pennsylvania has called for 50,000 militia for
defence for three months. The Governor of Illinois has offered
10,000 men to resist the invasion.</q></p>
<p><q>June 27, Morning.-General Ewell entered Chambersburg on Wednesday, and isused on order forbidding
the inhabitants to sell liquor to the soldiers; also admonishing
persons not in military service to abstain from acts of hostility,
stating that acquiescence in the demands of the military authorities
would lessen the rigours of war. General Ewell's main force is
believed to have halted in the rear of Chambersburg, holding
all the roads and passes in the vicinity, and awaiting
reinforcements. General Early's division of Longstreet's corps,
consisting of ten regiments of infantry, with cavalry and artillery,
occupied Gettysburg yesterday.  It is supposed that General Early
will strike the Northern Central Railroad at Hanover Junction or
Fork, thirty miles distant.</q></p><pb n="27"/>
<p><q>The Confederates hold all the passes of South Mountain. They are
also in close proximity to Carlisle, but have not yet occupied the
place. The Federal General Smith commands the defences of the
Susquehannah. Colonel Pierce supersedes General Milroy at Bloody
Run. General Dana commands the defences of Philadelphia. The <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> says that two days ago half General
Lee's army was in Maryland and Pennsylvania; the other half,
immediately under the eye of Lee, was thirty miles south of the
Potomac, in the Shenandoah Valley. General Lee's whole army may be
described, in a military sense, as being in the same valley extending
thirty miles from Winchester to the Potomac, and thence fifty miles
northward to Chambersburg. The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>
does not anticipate a collision between Generals Lee and Hooker for
several days, and says--"It is probable that the first serious
hostilities will take place at Harper's Ferry, for that point, with
Lee's advance beyond the Potomac, is essential to Lee's communication
with the Shenandoah Valley and Richmond. Lee's siege trains will,
therefore, probably be first used against the Maryland Heights, in
conjunction with an assault by the reserved column of General
Longstreet."</q></p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General War News.</hi></p>
<p>Vicksburg still defies the attempts of General Grant, and the
Confederates have entire possession of Milliken's Bend, above the
city. Telegrams published in the <hi rend="italic">Richmond
Despatch</hi> state that a desperate fight took place at Port Hudson
on the 12th ult. The Confederates left their fortifications, charged
upon the Federals, drove them from their intrenchments, and spiked
their siege guns. Northern despatches add that General Banks ordered
an assault on the place at daylight on the 14th, and at eleven o'clock
on the same morning retreated to his intrenchments, having been
disastrously repulsed at all points, with the loss of 700 to 1000
men. [This attack is fully described in another column.] It was
supposed that another assault would be made on the 17th ult., Colonel
Dudley having volunteered to lead a storming column of 4000 picked
men. The Confederates were reported to be concentrating in General
Banks's rear to prevent his retreat to Baton Rouge. General Johnston
continues to accumulate troops on the eastern side of the Big Black
River, and, according to the latest accounts, some skirmishing had
taken place between the Confederate cavalry and the outposts of the
Federal army at the bridge by which this river is crossed by the
Vicksburg and Jackson Railway.</p>
<p>A body of negro troops under Colonel Montgomery has pillaged and
burned the town of Darien, in Georgia; and a body of 1000 Texans has
been repulsed at Lake Providence by negro troops.</p>
<p>Confederate General Jackson commands the department of East
Tennessee, and has under him General Pegram, with 8000 to 10,000 men,
which, together with the force in the Cumberland Gap region, is
expected to move into Kentucky. Colonel Saunders, recently sent by
General Burnside upon a bridge-burning expedition into Eastern
Tennessee, returned to Boston, Kentucky, on the 23rd. He reports that
he destroyed three important bridges on the East Tennessee and
Virginia Railway and great quantities of stores; also, that he
captured 500 prisoners, three pieces of artillery, 200 cases of
ammunition, and 1000 stand of small arms.</p>
<p>Richmond is defended by the corps of D. H. Hill, 21,000 strong, on
the south side; by Major-General French on the north, or near the
city, with about 17,000 men; while the heavy brigade, under General
Wise, is on the York River Railroad. General Corse, with two brigades,
occupies Hanover Junction, assisted by 3500 mounted Texans taken
prisoners at Arkansas Port and exchanged. This force is to be drawn
close around and concentrated near the capital in case the Federal
army should advance.</p>
<p>The Confederates have lost two of their ironclads, one was captured
by the Federals at Savannah, and the other blew up in the Apalachicola
River. Several steamers had been sunk by the blockading squadron at
Charleston, and it is announced that hereafter the squadron will sink
all blockade runners. Sixteen Mobile adventurers have captured the
Federal steamer Boston at the mouth of the Mississippi, afterwards
burning two barques, and taking the steamer into Mobile. The
Confederate iron-clad steamer Atlanta, formerly the Finlay, steamed
out of Savannah and was captured by two Federal ironclads, after
thirty minutes' fighting. The Confederate cruisers are growing more
daring. At the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, and in that neighbourhood,
they had destroyed numerous Federal vessels. Admiral Dahlgren will
succeed Admiral Dupont in the command of the South Atlantic
squadron. Mr. Vallandigham has run the blockade in a vessel bound to
Nassau.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE LAST ASSAULT ON PORT HUDSON.</p>
<p rend="center">The Correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi>, writing from Port Hudson, June 17, gives a long account of Banks's assault on Sunday,
the 14th, which proved very disastrous to the attacking force.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Federal Position.</hi></p>
<p>Since the previous assault the position had been somewhat
changed. We now have no centre, but only a right and left, which,
joined together forms nearly a right angle, completely inclosing the
rebel stronghold on the east bank of the river. General Grover's
division is now on the upper side of Port Hudson, extending a distance
of nearly four miles from the river to the interior, to a point within
supporting distance of General Auger's division, which is on the west
side of the rebel fortifications, and extends a distance of about
three miles in the direction of the river to within hailing distance
of our fleet.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Confederate
Position.</hi></p>
<p>Before proceeding to give the detail, the correspondent gives the
following account of the rebel position derived from observations
"from a high tree within less than one hundred rods of the first line
of rebel defences":--</p>
<p>Looking from the extreme north-easterly range of rebel rifle-pits
towards the river on the upper side of Port Hudson, a long line of
earthworks can be seen glistening with bayonets and protected by a
ditch nearly 12ft. in width, and, for the purpose for which it was
built, unusually deep. Within short musket range enfilading
breastworks command every possible approach to the enemy's
position.</p>
<p>As I have before indicated in speaking of the conjunction of our
right and left, the rebel defences form nearly a right angle, both the
lines of which extend to the river, inclosing a sharp bend in the
stream, by which our gunboats found it so difficult to pass. The most
accessible approach apparently to the rebel earthworks is over a clear
field about 600 yards in width, and which, at first sight, presents
the appearance of an almost perfect level. This spot, however, since
our last assault has been determined to be, although the most
inviting, the most treacherous, place along the entire line of rebel
defences. Our soldiers in their charge found it to be filled with
deep, narrow gullies, too small to cover a large body of troops, and
too large to make a passage over them, even for infantry, barely
possible. Horses are out of the question, and were not used at this
point. These artificial ravines are completely covered with fallen
trees and vines, which are so arranged as to nearly obscure them from
sight, and make an advance over them a matter of extreme
difficulty. In our charge upon the enemy's lines at this spot it was
impossible for our soldiers to keep in regular order of
bottle. Frequently whole squads of men would sink out of sight, only
to be rescued by the assistance of their comrades. Down the right line
of the enemy's works all approach to the fortifications is made
exceedingly difficult by high bluffs and deep irregular gullies. The
enemy's rifle-pits are, although bearing the appearance of very wide
constructions, built upon the most approved modern engineering
skill. Here again fallen trees have been so arranged as to make it
impossible to move artillery or troops in line of battle. The entire
distance of rebel works presented for our reduction are nearly eight
miles in extent.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">THE PLAN OF ATTACK.</hi></p>
<p>Last Saturday evening the order of attack was determined upon at
headquarters, and communicated to the Generals who were to command the
assaulting columns.</p>
<p>The point of attack was the extreme north-easterly angle of the
enemy's breastworks, and the plan of the assault was briefly as
follows:--The 75th New York, under command of Captain Cray, and the
12th Connecticut, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Peck, were detailed as
skirmishers, forming a separate command under Lieutenant-Colonel
Babcock, of the 74th New York. The 91st New York, Colonel Van Zandt
commanding--each soldier carrying a five-pound hand-grenade, with his
musket thrown over his shoulder--followed next in order. The
skirmishers were to creep up and lie on the exterior slope of the
enemy's breastworks, while the regiment carrying the grenades were to
come up to the same position and throw over their grenades into the
enemy's lines, with a view to rout them and drive them from behind
their works. The 24th Connecticut, Colonel Mansfield, with their arms
in like manner to the grenade regiment, followed, carrying sandbags
filled with cotton, which were to be used to fill up the ditch in
front of the enemy's breastworks, to enable the assaulting party the
more easily to scale them and charge upon the rebels. Following these
regiments came, properly speaking, the balance of General Weitzel's
whole brigade, under the command of Colonel Smith, of the 114th New
York. Next came Colonel Kimble's and Colonel Morgan's brigades, the
last of which, with another brigade, was under the general command of
Colonel Birge. This force was held to support the assaulting column,
which was under the immediate command of General Weitzel, who made the
attack on the right. General Emory's old division moved in conjunction
with General Weitzel on the left, forming a separate column. The two
divisions (General Weitzel's and General Paine's) were under the
command of General Grover, who planned the assault under General
Banks's order. General Weitzel's division was expected to make a
lodgment inside the enemy's works, and in that manner prepare the way
for General Paine's division. After the inside of the enemy's
fortifications had been reached skirmishers were to push forward and
clear the way, while both columns were to be deployed in line of
battle, and move towards the town of Port Hudson, where a grand
citadel, which forms the last means of rebel defence, is situated.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Attack Commenced.</hi></p>
<p>About daylight the 75th New York, which had been slowly advancing
approached the enemy's works sufficiently near to see his
fire. Previously the columns of the main body of General Grover's
command were formed in the woods skirting the enemy's breastworks. The
12th Connecticut, during the night, had lost its way in the woods, and
the 91st New York was ordered by General Weitzel to take the place
that had been assigned to it, and follow immediately in the rear of
the 75th New York. After the advance of the 75th and 91st Regiments,
General Weitzel's entire command commenced moving forward. Several
days previous our army engineers had been preparing a covered way,
which extended from the woods where our troops lay to within about one
hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's position. Through this covered
way our troops marched in single file up to the point when the first
line of battle was formed. The covered way was relied upon as being
sufficiently deep to afford protection to our soldiers; but it turned
out to be of no considerable consequence, owing to some fault in its
construction. After the advance had arrived at the end of the covered
way, they began slowly to push over the innumerable barriers that had
been planted by the rebels to obstruct their march. The difficulties I
have before spoken of concerning the open field immediately facing the
enemy's works were here experienced. The deep gullies covered over by
brush and creeping vines were completely obscured from sight, and were
only known to exist after our soldiers had plunged into them. Part of
our skirmishers deployed to the right while suffering severely from
the enemy's fire, and a portion of the advance took up a position on
the left of the point to be attacked. They were immediately followed
by General Weitzel's column. General Paine in the meantime advaced
towards the enemy's works with his command further on the left. Our
troops, as soon as they had left the cover of the woods, which were
scarcely 300 yards from the enemy's breastworks, were subject to the
constant fire of the rebel infantry. A portion of our artillery, which
was planted some distance in the rear of our advancing forces, kept up
a continuous fire on the rebel works, and served very much to protect
our troops as they were advancing to the attack.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Attack.</hi></p>
<p>After our skirmishers had picked their way up to within about
thirty yards of the enemy's works they sprang into the ditch,
expecting to be able to shelter themselves under the cover of the
rebel fortifications, and keep the enemy down while the regiment, with
the hand-grenades, should advance and perform their part of the work
in driving the rebels from their position. The portion of the 75th
which succeeded in reaching the ditch were immediately repulsed, and
nearly all of them were killed or wounded. The ditch was so enfiladed
that it was impossible for men to live under the murderous fire of the
enemy.</p>
<p>In consequence of the repulse of the portion of the 75th that
succeeded in reaching the ditch the hand-grenades could accomplish but
little. In fact, although they made many desperate but gallant
attempts to be of service, they rather damaged than benefited our
chances of success, for, as they threw their grenades over the rebel
breastworks, the rebels actually caught them and hurled them back upon
us. In the meantime, while the skirmishers were nobly endeavouring to
sustain themselves in their position, Weitzel's column moved up as
rapidly as possible, and made a series of desperate assaults on the
enemy's works, for which, for bravery and daring, the history of war
can hardly furnish a parallel. At this time, the sun having fairly
risen, the fight became general; a fog, which had partially obscured
the contending armies, lifted, and revealed their respective
positions. The enemy were fully prepared for us, and they lined every
part of their fortifications with heavy bodies of infantry. The battle
had begun in earnest, and General Paine's column as well as General
Weitzel's was actively engaged. Under the general plan of attack, as
directed by General Banks, Generals Augur and Dwight were to make
feints on the extreme left of General Grover's position, to distract
the attention of the enemy from the main assault. Accordingly, before
the engagement became general between General Grover's command and the
enemy, Generals Augur and Dwight had attacked the enemy.</p>
<p rend=center"><hi rend="smallcap">THE Repulse.</hi></p>
<p>The fight, however, though only intended at a feint, was, on the
part of General Dwight's command, exceedingly severe, and scarcely
less so with General Grover's. General Dwight's loss in killed and
wounded will probably exceed two hundred. General Augur's loss will
fall considerably short of that number. Under General Grover's
command, probably the most desperate fighting was done by General
Weitzel's old brigade. Colonel Smith, leading these veterans, fell
early in the action, mortally wounded. The charges made on the rebel
works by our brave soldiers showed a determination to carry then at
all hazards; but human bravery on this occasion was not adequate to
the accomplishment of their object. The most formidable obstacle that
presented itself as a barrier to our success was the rebel glacis,
which at the point attacked had been constructed in such a manner as
to make every bullet tell that was fired from the rebel breast works
while our troops were endeavouring to make the ascent. In fact, the
real natural advantages and engineering ability at Port Hudson have
been rather under than over rated. Immediately upon the fall of
Colonel Smith, Lieut.-Colonel Von Petten, of the 160th New York, took
command of the brigade, and gallantly led the charge until all further
hope of driving the rebels from their position was gone. Brigade after
brigade followed in rapid succession, storming the rebel works until
compelled to fall back with great slaughter under the terrible fire of
the enemy.</p>
<p>The fighing ceased at eleven o'clock in the morning. We having
been repulsed in every assault, our soldiers, under command of their
officers, laid themselves down under the shelter of the gullies,
trees, covered way--in fact, everything that could afford them
protection--and waited for the day to pass and darkness come on. Many
of our wounded who were accessible were carried from the field by
squads detailed for that purpose. It is a shameful reflection on
humanity that a large number of our soldiers, carrying the wounded and
dying from the field on stretchers, were shot down by the enemy, and
in several instances the wounded were killed while being borne from
the field. At nightfall, however, we commenced the burial of our dead,
and succeeded before the morning in carrying most of our wounded from
the battleground.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">The Losses.</hi></p>
<p>I have no time to give you further details, as we have not yet
entirely recovered from the confusion at the battle, and a courier is
about leaving with despatches. Our total loss, however, in this last
attack upon Port Hudson, will probably not fall much short of 1000. It
is rumoured, just as I am closing this letter, that we are to attack
the enemy again to-night.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SIEGE OF VICKSBURG.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">In</hi> a contest conducted upon so stupendous
a scale as the war now waging between the rival Confederacies of
America it must often happen that operations of the greatest import to
those concerned in them, and to the ultimate issue of the struggle
become for a time neglected in the interest excited by still more
stirring events occurring elsewhere. Thus, while with the keenest
interest we were following the army of the Potomac, as, broken and
breathless, it recrossed the Rappahannock after its last advance on
Richmond, our attention was diverted to the masterly and successful
march of General Grant to the very threshold of Vicksburg. And, again,
while we were looking anxiously for news which should tell that the
fall of this city of the Mississippi had rewarded the efforts of the
one Federal General who seems to combine skill in action with boldness
at the council-table, or that the Confederates had succeeded in
raising the siege, we are diverted by the intelligence of Lee's
invasion of the North; and the fate of Vicksburg, which at one time
seemed likely even to influence the issue of the war, becomes at once
of secondary importance. Satisfied, however, that before long the
operations having for their object the possession of the Mississippi
will once again assume the importance which they deserve, we do not
hesitate, while we are busy preparing a map that shall illustrate
General Lee's present movements, to lay before our readers a plan of
Vicksburg which may explain the operations by which General Grant
brought his forces to the gates of the town, and help them to
comprehend the news which any mail may bring of further events
affecting his position.</p>
<p>Before relating the movemem±s of the opposing armies a short
space may advantageously be devoted to a description of the arena to
which their struggles have been confined. We will ask our readers,
then, to imagine a wide, deep canal 1000 miles long, extending from,
say Birmingham, through France and Austria, to the Black Sea. Let them
further fancy England at war with France, Austria, and the Swiss
Confederacy for the possession of such a canal, and picture upon the
map of Europe, which it would intersect, two powerful fortified
positions upon bluffs overlooking and commanding its passage, situated
say in the heart of France and garrisoned by French soldiers. Such a
condition represents fairly the Mississippi River, having Pittsburg,
the Federal Birmingham, on one of its branches, running for 1000 miles
through hostile peoples with its free navigation which is one great
object of the Federal party to secure, impeded by the strong positions
of Vicksburg and Port Hudson. To gain this end, and acquire the free
navigation of this noble river, no sacrifice of life and means has
been spared by the North.</p>
<p>To begin with, it will be remembered that Columbus, Island No. 10,
Memphis, New Orleans, and Baton Rouge were all taken at a great
outlay, of men, money, and material of war. So much being secured, it
was projected to render the position of Vicksburg harmless by cutting
an enormous canal into which the water of the Mississippi might be
diverted and Vicksburg avoided. The work was begun, and a cutting made
across the heel of the horse-shoe bend of the river indicated in our
Map. The work was completed, the river rose and fell, but the
Mississippi refused to accommodate itself to the new channel prepared
for its waters, and remained obstinately "secesh."</p>
<p>General Grant next ordered the Admiral in charge of the Federal
fleet above Vicksburg to force some of his transports and gunboats
past the town at every hazard, and to meet him below the point of
confluence of the Big Black and Mississippi rivers, for the purpose of
conveying his army across the latter river at Grand Gulf. This
movement was effected with remarkable skill and success on the 10th of
May. Several valuable vessels were lost in the attempt, but those that
succeeded in making the passage were quickly repaired, and were found
sufficient to carry out General Grant's purpose. Following up this
success by rapid marches, in pursuance of a singularly strategic plan,
General Grant at once sought the rear of Vicksburg.</p>
<p>He was first met and his way disputed at Thompson's Mill, near
Jackson, by a small body of men under General Bowen. Grant's army
numbered 70,000 men, not all of whom were, however, available for
action in the field. The fleet which he had at his command may fairly
be regarded as a contribution equal to 25,000 more. But it was only
available at such points of his march when he came upon the river,
where it not only furnished him with artillery, but brought him stores
and kept open his long line of supply and, if need were,
retreat. General Bowen had only two brigades under his command. They
fought well; but after contesting his passage for twelve hours, gave
way, and Grant, unable in his haste to give due care to his dead and
wounded, hurried on. The difficulties of his advance, and the
sufferings of his army under a sultry sun, in a tropical climate,
with short supplies and forced marches may easily be imagined. Upon
his way to Jackson he was next met at Raymond, where General Gregg,
with 4000 men, disputed his passage for three hours; and <pb n="28"/>
again, in the vicinity of Jackson, he was held in check by General
Johnson, who fought to gain time, which was spent in sending
provisions into Vicksburg, and by General Pemberton there in
completing the defences of the town.</p>
<p>Jackson having been occupied, Grant moved towards Vicksburg. At the
bridges that crossed the Big Black River he was met, on the 16th of
May by Pemberton with a much inferior force by whom he was fought on
that day and on the next at Big Black River Bridge. General Pemberton
effectually checked Grant's progress; but was compelled to fall back,
in consequence of being outflanked by a division of Grant's army,
thrown across the river higher up, some eight miles. Forced to retire,
and exhausted with the unequal strife, General Pemberton found so much
difficulty in carrying his artillery from the field that he spiked
many pieces, and, having transported his forces over the river, burnt
the bridges behind him. At this time, too, Haines Bluff was abandoned
by the Confederates.</p>
<p>On the 18th of May Grant, having rebuilt the bridges destroyed by
Pemberton, found himself in communication with the Federal fleet upon
the Yazoo River, which had previously been commanded by Haines
Bluff. On the same night General Pemberton, in anticipation of the
strait to which he might soon be reduced, sent from Vicksburg all his
spare horses and mules, which, after many perils, succeeding in
running the gauntlet of the Federal lines. No time was lost, and, on
the 18th, the Federal fleet was directed to shell and bombard the town
from the river, while Grant attempted to carry it by a coup de
main. The assault however, was repulsed with terrible slaughter. In
three other attempts, made with equal gallantry, the Federal troops
met with the same dogged resistance, and were beaten back. In
narrating these events it is difficult to know whether to award the
greater praise to the skill, endurance, and gallantry with which the
Federal army overcame the vast difficulties which lay between the
landing at Grand Gulf and their position before Vicksburg, or the
indomitable gallantry with which the Confederate forces contested
their march and hold them now in check.</p>
<p>But, meanwhile, a cloud somewhat larger than a man's hand gathers
on the rear of Grant's position. General Joseph B. Johnson, known to
be one of the most skilful, experienced, and prudent of the
Confederate chiefs, has been busy collecting an army at Jackson, and
only waits for sufficient artillery to advance upon Grant's
position. Artillery is being conveyed to him as fast as the railroads
can carry it, while General Lee threatens the source of his supplies
from the upper rivers; and, in all probability, before these words are
read, a blow of some decisive kind to one or other of the combatants
will have been struck.</p>
<p>When General Grant advanced on Vicksburg General Banks was directed
to attack Port Hudson, in order to detain at or near that place such
of the Confederate forces as might otherwise be made available for the
relief of Vicksburg. Accordingly, about the 26th of May, General Banks
invested the works at Port Hudson by land and water with an army which was amply provided with the military resources which the Federals possess in such abundance. As in the case of Vicksburg, the fleet poured upon the garrison a continuous
and heavy fire, after which, on the 27th, General Banks ordered the
assault to be made. It was upon this occasion that the experiment was
first tried of using the new levies of negroes, with such dire results
to them, that out of 900 who went under fire but 200 returned
alive. The slaughter of the Federals generally was fearful, as again
and again General Banks threw his gallant and unfortunate army upon
the Confederate lines of defence, until it became but too evident that
the place could only be reduced by the slow operations of a siege.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the relative positions of the combatants upon this
part of the banks of the Mississippi. It would be premature as yet to
speculate upon the news which must soon reach us; but time, which is
all, probably, that the Confederate Generals require to complete the
plans which are in progress to raise the siege of Vicksburg, must be
telling seriously upon the Federal army, operating at a great
distance, from their supplies, in an unhealthy season, and hemmed in
on all sides by watchful guerrillas who lurk about their camps and
along the water-courses. What its present condition is it is
impossible to say; but it has been stated that General Grant's
forces, which on landing at Grand Gulf amounted to 70,000 men,had been
reduced on the way to Vicksburg to 45,000.</p>
<p>The disposition of the Federal forces around Vicksburg are so
plainly indicated in the Map that no verbal description is
necessary. It  will be remembered that during the determined assaults
upon the tower, in the earlier stage of the siege, General Sherman met
his death.</p></div2>

<p>One of the most valuable veins of petroleum yet discovered was
lately struck on the Farrell farm, Old Creek, Verango County,
Pennsylvania. When the well commenced flowing, the oil spouted to a
height of fifty feet, with a roar like a hurricane, and escaping at
the rate of two thousand barrels per day. A stop-cock was got on after
much trouble, and the flow can now be regulated to suit the
demand. Another flowing well in the vicinity was so affected by the
opening of the new well that its yield decreased over three hundred
barrels per day. The Farrell well, which is about 450 ft. deep, was,
at last accounts, flowing steadily at the rate of twelve hundred
barrels a day. This, even at the moderate prices ruling at the wells,
would yield the owners 3600 dols. a day.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">Great Battle At Gettysburg,
Pennsylvania.</hi></p> 
<p>An engagement extending over several days has been fought in
Pennsylvania between the picked armies of the rival
federations. According to accounts previously received the Confederate
Commander-in-Chief was reported to be massing his troops on the line
of the Cumberland Valley Railroad, between Chambersburg and Carlisle,
and at the same time the Northern army, under the leadership of its
newly appointed chief, General Meade (General Hooker having
resigned), was known to be advancing by way of Frederick and
Middleburg towards the Pennsylvanian frontier. From this intelligence
it was apparent that the meeting between the two armies could not be
far distant, and that it would probably take place in the confines of
Pennsylvania. Such has proved to be the case. The divisions forming
the advanced columns of the Federal army were met by a subdivision of
the Confederate army on the morning of Wednesday, the lst of July, on
the western side of the small town of Gettysburg. An engagement
followed, which resulted in the defeat of the Federal troops. So far
as we can gather from the telegraphic summary but two divisions of the
Northern army were engaged--one commanded by Reynolds and the other by
Howard. The former, having taken up a position on a wooded ridge to
the west of Gettysburg, was, while thus placed, attacked by the
Confederates. The Federal troops were in the first instance
successful. But after a short time fortune changed sides. The right
wing of the Federals was turned, and when, after two hours' fighting,
Howard came to the aid of Reynolds, he found it impossible to regain
the position on the right which had been taken by the
Confederates. He, however, brought his troops to the front, when
General Ewell came up with a force of 25,000 men, and succeeded in
placing the Federals under a cross fire. Both flanks were then turned,
and the Federal troops retired through Gettysburg after having
sustained considerable loss. The Confederates took possession of the
town, and so terminated the engagement of the 1st of July. It was,
however, but the prelude to a far more terrible one on the succeeding
day. It is described as having been one of the bloodiest battles of
the war, and, even judging from the meagre details which have reached
us, we can readily believe in the justice of the description.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd the main body of the Federal army, under
Meade, joined the divisions which, after the batlle of the preceding
day, had taken up a position to the south of Gettysburg. In the course
of the forenoon of that day Meade arranged his troops far the battle
which he knew to be imminent. His right wing rested on a cemetery to
the south of the town, and was composed of the first and eleventh
corps of his army. The left wing, which was commanded by
Sickles,rested on the crest of a hill, and the battle front of the
army had a north-western aspect. In the afternoon General Sickles made
a reconnoissance in force, which brought his troops into collision
with the Confederates, and shortly afterwards the engagement became
general. The Southern forces rushed to the attack with their usual
impetuosity. On the right the Federals were obliged to retire, but it
was only for a time. They rallied and recovered their previous
position. On the left the Confederates drove their opponents over the
crest of the hill on which they were placed and down the opposite
side. But the left wing of the Federal army, like the right, again
succeeded in regaining its previous position. When the sun set the
battle-field was covered with slain; but relative positions of the two
armies remained unaltered. In the course of the night the Confederates
renewed the engagement, but with little result. At eight o'clock on
the evening of the 3rd the Federal General reported that the
Confederates had opened a heavy fire against his left and centre,
which they maintained for three hours without intermission; and that
subsequently they had twice assaulted the Federal position, but with
ill success. No later intelligence had been received in New York when
the mail left.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi> gives some particulars
of Major-General G. S. Meade, promoted to the chief command of the
army of the Potomac, in room of General Hooker, who was relieved from
the command at his own request, being "impressed with the belief that
his usefulness as a commander was impaired":--</p>
<p>"General Meade was born in Spain in 1816; entered the Military
Academy at West Point from the district of Columbia, and was graduated
there in 1839, and appointed second Lieutenant in the 3rd Artillery;
resigned his commission, October 6, 1836; was appointed Second
Lieutenant in the Topographical Engineers, May 19, 1842; was breveted
First Lieutenant for gallantry at Monterey, in 1846; became First
Lieutenant in August, 1851; Captain, May 19, 1856; and
Brigadier-General of Volunteers, August 31, 1861. In June, 1862, he
was promoted to a majority in the Engineer Carps, which rank he still
holds in the newly-organised Engineer Corps of the regular army. Few
officers have performed more arduous duties or rendered more
distinguished and faithful service to the country since the
commencement of the war. In the seven day's fight before Richmond
General Meade was struck by a ball, which entered his side and passed
through his body, making a severe and painful wound. Under tender and skilful
treatment he rapidly recovered, and it was scarcely known that he had
left his couch when he was in his saddle, ready to take part in the
sanguinary battle of South Mountain and Antietam. In these engagements
he commanded the Pennsylvania Reserves--a corps whose reputation for
courage and discipline has been surpassed by none. He was with that
corps in the battles at Drainsville, on the Chickahominy, and in
Maryland. When General Hooker was wounded at Antietam General
M'Clellan placed General Meade in command of the corps which had just
been deprived of its heroic leader. During the action General Meade
received a slight contusion from a spent grapeshot, and had two horses
killed under him. He distinguished himself greatly during the battle,
being in the thickest of the fight, encouraging his men by his deeds
of daring and valour. At Fredericksburg he maintained his reputation
for coolness, courage, and skill, winning the unstinted applause of
the army and the hearty congratulations of a grateful and appreciative
people."</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcap">General War News.</hi></p>
<p>General French has abandoned Maryland Heights destroying all the
fortifications, and has moved to co-operate with General Meade. The
city of Carlisle, a few miles from Harrisburg, had been shelled by a
small Confederate force. Business in Philadelphia is entirely
suspended, and the Pennsylvanian collieries are closed. General Dana
has issued a proclamation stating that the Confederate strategy was
sufficiently understood to make it certain that Philadelphia was
their object, and urging the people to arm for defence. The Mayor of
Philadelphia has called upon the people no longer to close their eyes
to the startling danger and disgrace hanging over the State and
city. The defences of Baltimore are manned by 10,000 citizens, and all
arms have been taken from private persons. Martial law has been
proclaimed in Baltimore and Western Maryland. The Governor of New
Jersey has again called on the militia to go to the aid of
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The War Department issued an order on the 28th ult., offering a
bounty of 400 dollars, and one month's pay of thirteen dollars in
advance, to all the volunteers between the ages of eighteen and
forty-five whose term of service has expired or is about to expire,
and who  will re-enlist for three years or the war.</p>
<p>The bridge across the Susquehannah at Columbia, burnt by the
Federals to prevent the Confederate advance, is said to have cost
1,000,000 dollars.</p>
<p>General Dix, who had assumed the command of the Federal army on the
peninsula, had taken possession of White House and sent out a cavalry
force. This force had cut the railway bridge over the South Anna, and
had penetrated to within nine miles of Richmond. They captured several
prisoners, including General Fitzhugh Lee, who was lying ill at a
private house.</p><pb n="59"/>
<p>In Kentucky and Ohio much alarm existed in consequence of the 
advance of Generals Pegram and Marshall, with 15,000 men, through
Cumberland Gap.</p>
<p>In Tennessee General Rosencranz had commenced a forward movement,
and had driven the Confederates to Tullahoma. Bragg's forces had
retreated in a demoralised condition from Tullahoma to Winchester,
leaving behind them a large quantity of provisions and some guns.</p>
<p>The news from the Mississippi is of a doubtful character. The
defenders of Vicksburg are said to be showing great activity, and
General Johnston had advanced to within a short distance of Grant's
army. Johnston is said to have received reinforcements from Bragg, and
to be perfecting arrangements to attack General Grant. The bombardment
of Port Hudson continues. The place, however, was considered
impregnable; and it was believed that the siege would have to be
raised. The Confederate Generals Marmaduke, Price, and Kirby Smith
have got possession of several points along the banks of the
Mississippi, and would probably attempt to seize Milliken's Bend and
obstruct the navigation. The Confederates were very active in the
neighbourhood of New Orleans, which was evidently in jeopardy. In
Louisiana the Confederates were gradually reoccupying the places taken
not long since by the Federals.</p>
<p>President Davis has called upon the Confederates for troops for
home defences, to replace Lee's invading army.</p>
<p>The story of the Tacony and her crew is one of romance. Lieutenant
Read was detailed early in May from the Confederate steamer Florida,
formerly the Oreto, one of the Liverpool built war-steamers, to take
command of the brig Tacony, with an armament of one howitzer and a
crew of about twenty-five men. Sailing close along the northern coast,
he captured and burnt vessel after vessel, many of them of value. He
lured them sometimes to approach him by a signal of distress. The
ravage he committed was great, and a fleet of war-vessels was in
pursuit of him. At length he captured a schooner, which he thought
would better answer his purpose, and, transferring his armament to
her, burned the Tacony. Thus he hoped longer to elude his
pursuers. But a still bolder project occurred to him, the seizure of a
revenue cutter, the Caleb Cushing, which lay in the harbour of
Portland, Maine. He accomplished this owing to a favouring accident on
the night of the 26th ult., and put to sea. The loss of the Cushing
being discovered the following morning, the citizens hastily manned
two steamers, started in pursuit, and succeeded in overtaking
her. After a few shots had been exchanged Lieutenant Read set fire to
the Cushing and returned to the Archer, which was afterwards captured
by the steamers. All the ransom bonds of prizes released by the Tacony
were found on board.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">France</hi> has Mexico. The capital was
virtually won at La Puebla, and the north-western march of the French
was all but unopposed. It is, however, due to the military character
of our gallant neighbours to add that they lost no time in improving
their victory, and hastened to seize points at which a determined
resistance might have been offered with disastrous results to
themselves. They pushed forward with energy, and the Imperial eagle
has dethroned the eagle and serpent. The Sovereigns of the old world
have been somewhat in haste to congratulate the "Parvenu;" but there
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> matter for congratulation in this
success. We have from the outset expressed our conviction that a
French occupation of Mexico must do good--not unalloyed good, it is
true; but the imposition of anything like order and law upon a people
utterly unaccustomed to either cannot fail to lay the seeds of a
civilisation that will bear fruit in good season. We look with neither
real nor affected horror upon the operations of the French in
Mexico. At the very lowest, they are police operations of a salutary
character, but we have hope that they will prove to be something
nobler and better. We therefore hope, also, that the so-called
national party, which could never be consolidated while peaceful and
honest reform was to be done, but which was promptly welded into a
formidable conspiracy against a reformer from abroad, will discover
that further resistance is useless, and will accept the lessons which
the Tuileries schoolmaster has undertaken to teach. Those who see in
this Mexican conquest a tyrannical suppression of the liberties of a
people must have studied to little purpose the disgraceful history of
Mexico for the last quarter of a century. It was time that she should
be taken in hand, and, if the force under General Forey be not
sufficient for the tranquillisation of the region, there is an army in
another famous capital that is eager to get rid of those military
occupants, an army which might very well be transferred from the cause
of brigandage and applied to aid in its suppression.</p>
<p>The Federal Government in North America will probably have
something to say upon the subject of the occupation; and, indeed,
certain of the Northern organs have already been good enough to inform
the Emperor that as soon as the civil war shall have been concluded by
the subjection of the South, he will do well to evacuate Mexico, or
those who have visited it as conquerors may visit it again as
protectors and avengers. Setting aside this somewhat informal
notification, or regarding it as a hint which does not precisely
demand immediate attention, we may be permitted to consider what
effect a different result of the civil war from that indicated by the
New York press will have upon the plans of the Emperor. Now it is due
to that Sovereign to bear in mind that when he has issued a programme he always adverts to it at the close of his campaign,
and points out how far he has been able to carry out his announced
designs, and what he has deemed it wiser to abandon. The Emperor, when
Spain and England withdrew from active co-operation in his designs
upon Mexico, stated that he came for the good of the people, and for
the purpose of enabling the rightminded among them to execute
regenerative operations which had been rendered impossible by the
strife of factions and the absence of national ideas. Passing over the
question whether his Majesty had not supposed that the conquest would
be easier than it turned out to be, and whether he under-estimated the
strength of the hatred which unites robbers against the police, we may
give him credit for having conducted the war with an undaunted rigour,
and in the face of a general and discouraging readiness on the part of
Europe to believe that the campaign was disastrous. He holds Mexico;
but it has cost much. We mean nothing disrespectful in saying that
France is not more ready than England to make sacrifices without
securing some form of reward. It is true that we are usually cheated
the moment we lay by the sword and take to the pen; but we do our
humble best to recoup ourselves the losses we sustain, and France is
generally more fortunate. Now, the Americans, North and South, are out
of court in this matter. We all know what the Union gained by the
Mexican War, and unless American diplomatists have recourse to the Monroe doctrine (incorrectly so termed, by-the-way), and
 declare that European Powers have nothing to say on the soil of the
 New World--a logic against which England has the very best reason to
 protest--it is not for fellow-citizens of the Californians and Texans
 to object upon principle to any concession which a regenerated Mexico
 may make in gratitude to her French regenerator. But supposing that
 the South should establish its claim to recognition, and the rumour
 should be true that a French General has in his portfolio powers to
 publish such recognition in the great square of Mexico on the part of
 France, the relations of the Emperor and of Mr. Davis will take a new
 aspect. Clearly, the sea of Southern gratitude, to use a gracious
 form of words in lieu of a cynical one, will take a distinct form,
 and, between the kindness of the recognised Confederation and of the
 regenerate Mexico the Emperor may find himself obliged to accept the
 reward of his goodness. In plainer terms, a permanent French
 settlement in Mexico may be among the things of the future; perhaps
an incipient Algiers.</p>
<p>As regards the Mexicans themselves, we believe that such a result
of the war would be a benefit. The French are not good colonists, but
they are an admirable police. They, when in earnest to put down
brigands (such brigands not having had their poniards blessed at
St. Peter's) do the work effectually, and, as under the stern old
Romans, "the robber is smothered in his cave or stabbed at its mouth."
But it is with a higher class of ruffianism that France will have to
deal also, and with a fierce system of robbery and jobbery which sends
its agents into Government houses, and works ambidextrously with
proclamations and with pistols. A new organisation will have to be
devised and carried out, and the astounded Mexicans will have to learn
that law does not mean law conditionally on its exponent holding a
long knife; but means a rule to be obeyed silently and punctually by
all people and under all circumstances. We admit that to hope that
this lessonn will be learned in a hurry is a hope in the spirit of the
stage direction in a late wit's proposal to dramatise Lord Macaulay's
History--"Enter St. Augustine: a pause of five-and-twenty minutes
while he converts the Britons to Christianity." But the lesson will
be taught in time. The Arabs of Algeria have at length been made to
comprehend that they are to recover a debt by putting the defendant
into a court and not into a fire.</p>
<p>But as regards England. There is a swarm of little red marks on the
right of the map at North America which indicates that England has an
interest in knowing all about new settlers between 10 deg. and 30
deg. and 60 deg. and 110 deg. Well, we incline to think that should
the Emperor decide on a permanent occupation, we might have a worse
neighbour. We should have an ally, and one who professes, and, as we
believe, with truth, to consider England and France as the natural
leaders of the world, and Powers with whom it would be insanity to
quarrel, when, united, they have the world at their disposal. There is
another reason or two why a French settlement in Mexico would not be
disadvantageous to us, and we think that England will have no cause to
object to the congratulations of our Queen being added to those of the
other Sovereigns.</p></div2>

Government could only rely on the promise of Mr. Seward that in all
cases of this kind strict justice would be done. He had no official

<p>Any one who was so sanguine as to hope that the fratricidal contest
which wages in the once United States of America was even verging
towards a termination must now confess that a glance at the situation
dissipates any such fond idea. Without entering into a minute
consideration of the military events which have recently occurred it
may well be predicated of them that they have postponed the conclusion
of the civil war <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi>. Those whose
proclivities are towards the South, while giving every credit to Meade
for the only piece of real generalship that has been developed by the
Federal leaders, still preserve their faith in the star of Lee. They
still believe that, if he has received a check, he has nevertheless
retired in good order, and only leans back the better to leap forward,
as the French proverb has it. They assert that his movement into the
enemy's country was not an invasion, but a raid to procure stores and
provisions elsewhere than in his own somewhat exhausted territory:
they prophesy a great Southern victory, and treat the surrender of
Vicksburg as an organised <hi rend="italic">canard</hi> for Federal
purposes in connection with the chartered American anniversary of the
4th of July. Assuming that the next news fulfils these expectations we
still doubt whether carrying the war into the dominions of the North
was calculated to promote the cessation of hostilities. People talk
of a decisive battle won by the South as likely to bring about a
settlement of the dispute. In such a contest as that in which North
and South are engaged decisive battles are not likely to occur. As
yet, there has been no approach on either side to such a victory as
would be entitled to rank even theoretically, amongst decisive
battles; and we confess we do not see much chance of the attainment of
any such success either by Meade or Lee. This civil war has within it
peculiar elements. It is not the sanguinary sport of Kings, but the
deadly struggle of a divided people for political and social
supremacy. It partakes of the fierce contention between individual
men; it has the unnatural ferocity which characterises the hatred of
brothers which has risen to the height of a thirst for each other's
blood. It is not tempered by the chivalry which belongs to war carried
on between two different nations, and it has long passed beyond the
reach of that diplomacy which is always watching a favourable moment
to intervene in a quarrel between rival Monarchs. He is hardy who
ventures to predict anything which relates to this American
difficulty; but we will venture to say that the only circumstance
which seems to us likely to have an influence on the contest will be
the next Presidential election. Many reasons, which it is not
convenient for us to enter upon now, might be stated to show why this
event may become the turning point of the quarrel. It was the election
of one President which was the immediate cause of the war; the
election of another may be the means of bringing it to an
end.</p></div2>

<p>The tide of success seems to have set in at present for the
Federals. To the repulse met with at Gettysburg by General Lee,
announced in our last Number, we have now to add a still more serious
blow to the pride and interests of the South in the fall of
Vicksburg.</p>
<p>First, let us follow the fortunes of General Lee. By the details
which have come to hand of the battle of the 3rd inst., at Gettysburg,
we find that it was as General Meade described it, "one of the
severest actions of the war." It lasted twelve hours, from daybreak to
five in the afternoon; and during the whole of that time the
Confederate forces were engaged in successive assaults of the most
obstinate character on different points of the Federal position. The
battle opened by a vigourous cannonade and assault on the extreme
Federal left, the enemy striving, by a series of rapid and fierce
attacks, to pierce or turn it early in the day. After three hours'
fighting, however, the attnnpt not only failed, but the Confederate
right was forced back across the whole battle-field of that morning
and the previous day. During this attack on the left a resolute and
formidable attempt was made to flank the Federal right, and it is
clear that the superior position of the Confederates gave them every
prospect of success in this direction. Behind the Confederate left
rose a densely-wooded and lofty hill, from the summit of which the
Confederate batteries could command the Federal right and centre on
Cemetery Hill. The great effort of the day was to turn this position,
and at one time it seemed doubtful whether the effort would not be
successful. In the assault upon it General Hill's corps was brought
from the other wing to reinforce General Ewell. The reserve Federal
artillery brought into play from elevated points behind the Cemetery
Hill, and the vigourous resistance of the eleventh corps on the
Federal right, partially checked the Confederate advance; but the
opportune arrival of two bridgades of militia to reinforce the Federal
right obliged the Canfederates to retire. They retired, however,
slowly, fighting desperately at every step until the afternoon, when
their attempt to turn the right was finally abandoned. Within an hour
another and final effort was, however, made. The Confederate troops
were again massed along the whole Federal line, but by five o'clock
they were driven back at all points, and the engagement terminated,
leaving the field in the hands of the Federals. The loss on both sides
is roughly estimated at 30,000. The Federals have also captured a
large number of prisoners with numerous waggon-trains, colours, and
arms.</p>
<p>On the 4th, General Lee retreated from Gettysburg by two
roads--through Fairfield on one side, and through Cashtown and
Greencastle on the other--to Hagerstown, where his head-quarters
are. Hagerstown is only a few miles from Williamsport, on the Potomac,
where the bridge of boats, by which part of the Confederate army
passed into Maryland, remains. The Potomac is, however, so greatly
swollen by recent rains that it is impossible either to ford it or to
build pontoon bridges across it. General Meede marched in pursuit as
rapidly as the state of the roads would permit.</p>
<p>To the 13th there had been no fresh engagement, except some
skirmishes between the hostile armies in Maryland; but a battle was
believed to be imminent. General Lee, whose forces are said to occupy
a strong position around Hagerstown, was engaged in sending his
wounded men and his commissariat stores across the Potomac, but none
of his troops had quitted Maryland, and he had drawn fresh supplies of
ammunition from Virginia. There was a rumour that hehad been joined by
40,000 men from General Beauregard's army. The Federal forces under
General Meade and General Couch were concentrating in front of the
Confederate army, and would, it was supposed assume the offensive, and
assail General Lee's position.</p>
<p>Vicksburg has surrendered unconditionally. On the 3rd General
Pemberton sent two officers to the camp of General Grant, to ask that
commissioners should be appointed to settle the terms of the
surrender.  This request was refused. General Pemberton himself then
had an interview with General Grant, and the surrender was agreed
upon. The garrison, variously stated at 10,000, 12,000, and 27,000
fighting men, were paroled, and rations given them to enable them to
reach their lines. The guns and arms captured are very numerous. The
immediate causes of surrender were the exhaustion of supplies and
ammunition and the failure of General Johnston to come to the
assistance of the garrison. The fleet of Admiral Porter is now ready
to co-operate in the attack on Port Hudson, whilst is reckoned that no
fewer than 100,000 veteran troops are placed at the disposal of the
Federal Government. Of the whereabouts of Johnstone, who was to have
relieved Vicksburg, no mention is made. Southern papers speak of an
advance of their troops upon New Orleans, and the capture of some
thousands of Federal soldiers.  General Neal Dow has been
captured. These accounts are probably exaggerated. It appears,
however, to be certain that a considerable body of Confederates had
shown themselves between General Banks and New Orleans, and that
alarm existed in that city. The recovery of New Orleans was not
probable, but the relief of Port Hudson and the capture of Banks were
within the bounds of probability.</p>

General fix is reported to have abandoned White House, and

returned to Fortress Monroe, after destroying the railway communi

cation between Richmond and Lee's army.

The Confederate General Bragg has crossed the Tennessee River

and destroyed the bridge at Bridgeport. It is stated that General

Bragg will make the Tennessee River his future line of defence.

(Jeneral Morgan, the active Confederate leader, with 8000 men, has ea.ptcred Corydon, Indiana, and is advancing to Jeffersonville, where there are large Federal supplies. Business is suspended at Indiumpolls, and the Governor of Indiana has called out 50,000 men.

Between 8000 and 9000 Confederates, under Generals Holmes, Price,

and Maim aduke, made an attack on Helena, Arkansas, on the morning of the 4th. They advanced in three columns, but the roughness of the ground prevented them bringing up their artillery, and they attempted to carry their works by assault. The centre column charged in the direction of Port Cnrti, and took three lines of rUle-pits. The flank attack was not so successful, which subjected the centre to an enfilading fire, which swept them clown in great numbers. They were soon surrounded, and one whole brigade, numbering 840, was captured.

Among the vessels recently overhauled by the Confederate cruisers was the George Griswold, which some time ago brought to Liverpool a cargo of provisions for the operatives of -the cottonmanufacturing districts. The ship was on her way from Cardiff to Rio with a cargo of coals, belonging, it would seem, to British subjects; and he was, therefore, released on the captain giving the bond usually demanded in such cases. The following vessels have been captured and burnt by the Alabama:-The ship Amazonian, bound from New York to lionte Video, was burnt on the 2nd of June; and the Jabez Snow, bound from Liverpool for Monte Video, was burnt on the 29th of Hay. The crews of these vessels were landed at Monte Video. The Georgia captured the ship Hope, bound from Boston- to the Cape of Geep Hope, together with the G. W. Seaver, bound from Boston for Rio. The latter vessel was released upon giving bonds for 15,000 dole. The Pemambuco papers state that the Iorida, Confederate cruiser, bas taken possession of the Bocas Wands--a small group of desert ioeks near the Island of Fernando Noronita- as her base of operations.

At Washington, on the evening of the 7th, President Lincoln, --j General Halleck, and Secretaries Seward were serenaded on the receipt of the news of the surrender of Vicksbnrg. In returning thanks the President made an unimportant speech, General Halleck claimed l the merit of retaining General Grant in command, and consequently of the victory he achieved. Secretary Stanton declared that the real victory had been won over Copperheads as well as rebels. Mr. Seward admitted that he was originally opposed to the war, and desired to put it off, if possible. If that were a weakness there was a warrant for it in the character of Him who died to save the world, who desired the cup to pass from Him if his Heavenly Father pleased, but, if not, He would accept it. Another report states that Mr. ieward said He had been censured for his predictions that the rebellion would be ended in ninety days, and at would have been ended before it was begun if councils of patriots had been held. It had been protracted by the hopes held out of foreign interference, if foreign nations would keep their hands off the Americans would settle all their own quarrels."

The New York Herald save that there has been a crisis in the Cabinet in reference to the peace question. Mr. Seward wished to issue a Presidential proclamation offering an amnesty to all but the leaders of the rebellion, withdrawing the emancipation proclamation, suspending the Confiscation Act, and offering protection to the personal property and rights of the Southern people. According to the Herald, lie was opposed by a majority of the Cabinet. The 'epnblican party are said to be preparing a petition to the President. in reference to the restoration of peace and the Union, on the basis of the extinction of slavery in 1876.

The Washington Government had refused to allow Mr. Stephens, the Confederate Vice-President, to present in. person to President Lincoln important communications from Presdent Jefferson Davis. '['he Southern papers state that 'Vice-President Stephens's visit to Washington was either to arrange for the exchange of prisoners or to inform the Federal :Government that if private property was not respected the Confederates would retaliate. The New York Herald asserts that Vice-President Stephenss message was a proposition from President Davis for a separate Government for the North and South, but only one President. The Tribune says that the Secretary of War has given orders for mounting guns and garrisoning the forts in Portland Hai5bour, and has authorised the Governor of -Maine to raise artillery companies for the defence of the coast towns.

It is stated that the Federal Government has ordered a levy of d00,000 conscripts. A serious riot has occurred at New York caused by the enforcement of the draught.

AMERICA,

EERIOtS RIOTS AT NEW YORK.

The attempt to enforce the conscription in New York has either provoked, or been made the excuse for, formidable riots. That city was for three days in the hands of a mob, which commsucefl with stopping the draughting, destroying the building in wjich it was going on, and assaulting the officers. This was but the prelude. Houses were assailed, plundered, and fired; shops sacked; the streets filled with the denizens of the back slums; and the obreak at last took the shape of an anti-abolitionist crusade, and a hunt or unarmef negroes, and the burning down of the Coloured Orphan Asylum. The outbreak ended with a thieves' carnival.

Balloting began on Saturday, the 11th ult., and durng that day the names of more than ri)OO conscripts were drawn. O the morning of the 13th a mob assembled in front of the Provost Marshal's office broke into it, destroyed the ballot-boxes, and fired the buildwhich, with the adjoining houses, was completely destroyed, as the firemen refused to attempt to extinguish the flames. The mob, which is said to have consisted of about 15000, persons, composed mostly of the labouring population, infuriated women, and lads of seventeen downwards, and to have been headed by a Virginian named Andrews and some three hundred other leaders, afterwards dispersed in strong bodies throughout the city, and committd atrocious outrages. The rioters burned the Armoury, the Coloured Orphan Asylum, and many houses inhabited by obnoxious persons or by negroes. They sacked the office of the New York Tribuee and fired the building, whih was, however, saved from destruction by the firemen. They assailed all the negroes whom they found in the streets, and murdered some fifty unhappy blacks-one of whoni they banged and burned by a fire kindled beneath him. A party of the Provost's Guard fired on the mob, but were overpowered and horribly used; and many policemen were slain or maltreatefiSuperintendent Kennedy saving his life with difficulty. On th

 following day the riots were renewed, and all the shops were closed-, business being completely suspended, cabs and omnibuses having ceased to ply, and the city telegraphs having been destroyed by the mob. More houses, including the Postmaster's, were burned, and the Mayor's dwelling was assailed. There were several encomitei

between the soldiery or militia and the rioters, and many lives were lost. The mob seizul Colonel O'Brien and hanged him on a lamppost. The disturbances spread to Staten Island, and some ncgroes' houses were burned in Brooklyn; but few or no further murders of blacks were committed, as the negroes had fled from the city. On the 15th the riots continued, business was again suspended, and there were several fresh collisions between the troops soil mob in the upper part of New York.

During these riots the authorities had not been idle; for they had summoned a special police, had called out the militia, and had brought a considerable body of troops from Baltimore, while Governor Seymour had declared the city and county of New York to be in a state of insurrection. But the diminution of the rioting on the 15th nit, seems to have been mainly due to a proclamation and speech of the Governor of the State of New York. In his proclamation, Governor Seymour declared that the only opposition to tie conscription that would be allowed was an appeal to the Courts, and that he would suppress rioting by every means in his power. In his speech, however, he said that he had applied to the Federal Cabinet at Washington, and had urged the postponement of the drauht. Headded that the decision of the courts on the question of the' legality of the draught must be obeyed if the draught were declared legal, but that he would use his influence to prevent inequality between rich and poor.

New York papers of the 13th slate that the riots had almost entirely subsided on the previous day. The wards where the greatest excitement had prevailed were filled with large forces of military, who patrolled the streets entirely unmolested by the populace. Business went on almost as generally as before the unfortunate disturbances took place, and all the cars and stages performed their trips as usual. A number of regiments had arrived from different quarters, and the authorities did not apprehend any further disturbance.

The Republican press argue that the riots in New York are really part and parcel of the Southern rebellion, while the Democratic press assert the obnoxious conditions of the draught to be the sole cause. But Americans would gladly escape the principal blame of this

graceful riot, and lay it on the Irish,

lies officially announced that the Government will sustain the enforcement of the draught with military force.

There has been resistance to the draught in Boston, but the disturbances were promptly suppressed.

In Philadelphia and Massachusetts the draught was proceeding quietly.
WAR NEWS.

General Lee's army has repassed the Potomac into Virginia at Wiliiaxisport and Failing Waters; and the movement, which appears to have been completed on the 13th or 14th ult., was said to have been effected in good order, though the Federal forces captured two guns and 2000 prisoners, including an entire brigade of infantry, winch may be presumed to have composed the onfederate rearguard. General Lee, when last heard of, was at Front Royal, making his way towards Richmond.

The Confederate General Morgan's" raid" into Indiana and Oho ha

Li Tennessee General Rosencrana was still driving General Bragg before him, and had captured 4000 prisoners.

General Dodge officially reports that he routed the Confederates under Forrest and Biffles in the neighbourhood of Corinth.

The fail of Port Hudson has followed that of Vicksburg. The fortress surrendered unconditionally on the 8th nit. The number of prisoners will not exceed 7000-one informant places them at 6000. There had been no general engagement at port Hudson for some days previous to the surrender, all having been quiet, excepting that artillery practice was kept up on both Sides. Provisions had 1eeu short with the Confederates for some time, and, their communications having been cut off, they could not obtain more supplies. There were no hopes of succour from the forces known to be in the vicinity; hence there was no alternative but surrender or starvation.

Immediately after the surrender of Vicksburg General Sherman marched against General Johnston, and is said to have defeated bun after a very sanguinary engagement.

A fresh attack on the defences of Charleston commenced on the 10th cit., and a landing having been effected on Morris Island, all the Confederate works on that island, with the single exception of Fort Wagner, were captured by the Federals. According to accounts of the 12th cit., the siege at Fort Waoner was progressing; and five irouclads and fifteen gunboats were engaged in battering and bom bardmg the Confederate defences.

A vessel that has arrived at Falmouth re uorts the capture SI1

destruction of two fine North American vessels by Captain Semines, of the Confederate cruiser Florida. One of the vessels is said to have had bar silver on board to the value of £20,000. The crews of the two vessels were put on board the ship that brought the news IA) Falmouth.

LOYI)ON: SATURDAY, AU'GVST 1, 1863,

RECORD, not comment, and far less prediction, seems the only

philosophic treatment of the great Transatlantic struggle. For

every prophecy has in its turn been falsified, and the sagest arguments are made ridiculous by the latest telegram. A very short time ago, and no colour could be too roseate for depicting the condition of the South. Its fortresses were impregnable, while its gallant armies were advancing to hoist the secession flag upon the steeples of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, Again' all, changed, for the tenth time. A new Federal General (in his childhood known to the Duke of Wellington, it is said, though dates smile scrnfnlly at the statement) has confronted the Southern victor, prevented his advance, and made his retreat an act of probable wisdom. Two of the great fortresses have fallen, and the third is menaced by a more powerful force than has yet assailed it. The resources of the North are telling fearfully upon the Confederates.

Yet the next mail, or its successor, may have a new story to tell. Meade may have followed his foe, been led into a trap, and been discomfited ; or some new and brilliant stroke of Southern tactics may have thrown some hitherto unattached territory into the alarm which shook Philadelphia and almost roused New York. The dread game is being played on so large a board, and with such utter absence of rules, that none of its chances should surprise us. In the meantime, and at the very moment when Meade's skill and valour had excited the enthusiasm of his countrymen, New York was suddenly delivered

¥ over to a worse enemy than the Confederate. Riot was rampant, the negro was hunted down by the light of a score of conflagrations kindled in various quarters, the authorities were defied and outraged, and some of them murdered, and violence and plunder were theorder-or disorder-of the hour. The rabble had broken loose. We hear since that the military have used. shot and steel freely, that large numbers of the rioters have been slaughtered, and that the law is once more master, and will enforce the conscription. But the scenes, which are presented to as with a general exaggeration, corrected by the elaborate detail which the American reader loves, will scarcely pass from the memory of the New Yorker. He had previously only heard of slaughter: he has now seen it. and in its most repulsive form.

No Englishman can read of such work without regret. Upon the war itself there may be two opinions, and there can be no doubt that there are many British partisans of the South as of the North, though the majority of us cordially approve the policy of our Government and agree with the sentiment expressed in the Royal Speech; but all of us deplore the New York outrages. We never tolerate at home the interference of rioters or the mob in settling a question; and, where there are two sides actively espoused, and a rabble thrusts itself

into the struggle, both sides coalesce and put down the rioters.

We have the Anglo-Saxon liking for seeing any dispute settled

by legitimate means. Hence the people of New York, who have been exposed to the brutalities of a fractional portion of its dangerous classes, have our sympathy, and We shall all be glad to know that the strong hand has restored order. it is a libel upon Englishmen to allege that they have the slightest toimation for the perpetrators of atrocities like those which are described by
the American correspondents. It is possible that there may

have been some in the riots who hate or fear the conscription but itis obvious that the majority of the rioters are scoundrels whose ferocity and greediness have been roused, and who took advantage of the absence of troops to commit these outrages. We hope to hear that the castigation has been ample and effectual; and we have a right to expect our relatives in New York to believe that we feel towards them in the matter as they would feel towards us if they heard that a St. Giles's mob had broken loose, had ravaged certain districts of the metropolis, and bad been met by a cavalry regiment and dealt with according to desert. We are almost ashamed to have to insist upon this, but certain writers have made it necessary that such an assurance should go forth to the West.

We may add another, and we do so in all heartiness aud sincerity. The London season is over, a portion of our population has already escaped from town, and those who remain axe but devising plans for recreation and amusement. Another fortnight and our notables will either be in their country houses, regaining their own. health and ministering to the pleasures of their friends, or they will be hastening away over Europe, many with their faces set for other continents. The middle class, after a prosperous season, will be imitating their leaders, but in a modified degree. A noble harvest is all but ready. We are assured, on the highest authority, that European complications and American war have not materially injured our commerce. Care has been taken for the class most affected by the latter casualty, and there will not be much "complaining in our streets." We are at peace with the world, and we have no epidemic among our people or among our flocks. We have every reason to be thankful; and most of us are about to endeavour to enjoy our selves. It would be unworthy of us did we, in our own hour of comfort, forget our kinsmen whose fortune is now so different. We speak of the whole of the States of America; we speak not of Federals and Confederates, but of our brethren who talk our language and who think of England as the mother country. At this moment how opposite is their condition. Their best men, their citizens, fathers, husbands, brothers are in arms, and engaged in a war which off era no promise of conclusion. Their commerce is hindered, their produce belongs o the armies, and they are struggling with a taxation which must grind them cruelly. A conscription calls Northern and Southern alike into the field. And they have to deDlore the loss of thousands and thousands who have fallen in the field, or by a less enviable fate, and who, if this weary war continues, will be followed to the grave by other thousands. Such is the autumn to which our American brethren are looking. Let them, throughout the length and breadth of their noble country, accept the assurance that, though they turn a cold and scornful eye towards those who 'will take neither one side nor the other, the sympathy of Englishmen and Englishwomen goesforthto them, andthat those who seek to persuade them otherwise utter cowardly and wicked untruth. Without, we dare assert, any mingling of a selfish motive in the feeling, the news that the quarrel had been somehow adjusted, and that the sword was sheathed, would cause a shout of joy over the island, and as warm thanksgiving would ascend as on the day which President Lincoln has set apart for a religious service. These are not idle words, and. inasmuch as we know that they will be read in most parts of the States, we call upon American readers to note then', and to remember them when the time of slaughter shall have passed away.

to the army from the Nrict of Columbia, and entered theserviceas brevet Second I tenant of the 3rd Artillery on the 1st of July, 1835. He did not receive his full commission until the 31st of December, 1835, when he was made a full second Lieutenant. On the 26th of October, 1836, he resigned his connection with the United States' army, and was engaged in private pmsuif.a until 1842. On thel9th of May, 1842, he was reappointed to the United States' military service as a Second Lieutenant of Topographical Engineers. In this capacitT he joined the troops engaged in the Mexican War. His conduct in MexIco was marked by determination and bravery, and at the battle of Palo Alto he won great reputation. During the several conflints of Montery, on the 21st, 22nd, arid 23rd days of September, 1846, he again distinguished himself, and for his bravery was breveted a First Lieutenant, to date from the 23rd of September, 1846. This brevet was awarded in May, 1847. During the month of August, 1851, he was promoted to a first lieutenancy of his corps, and on the 19th of May, 1856, was further promoted to a captaincy.

When the war broke out, and

President Lincoln called for three

hundred thousand volunteers, the Pennsylvania Reserve Corps was raised and placed under the charge of General M'Call, as division corninander, and Generals Reynolds, Heads, and Ord, as brigade commanders. Heads was appointed a Brigadier-General of volunteers, with a commission to date from

f.1 31,1861. He wasthenplaced

iltarge of the second brigade of

that division, and proceeded to organize it at Tennallytown, near the waters of the Potomac, and in this vicinity wintered during 1861-2. When the army of the Potomac began to move upon Manassas, duningMarch 186-2, the division in which General Meade served was attached in the first corps, then under GeaeralM'Dowell. With him they remained north of the Rappahannock until after the battle of Hanover Station, when they were added to the army of the Potomac, Occupying part of

Re led these troops ctur1n

the eventful battles of South Mountain and Antletanu; and when, at the latter battle, General Rooker was wounded and had to leave the field, General Mesde for a short time had charge of the ninth army corps, formerly under General Reno.

After General Burnaide had been placed in charge of the army of the Potmac Ileneral Reynolds, who formerly commanded the Pennsylvania Reserves, after the retirement of General M'Cafl, wan ordered to command the whole of the first army corps, and General Meade was formally placed in command of the division of Pennsylvania Reservez.

On
the 15th of December, two days after this eventful battis, he was ordered to command the fifth army corps, formerly under General Fitz-John Porter and more recently under General Butterfield. To enable him prcxperly to hold, that position he was appointed by the President a Major-General of volunteers, and was regularly nominated to the United States' Senate during January, 1868. The Senate making certain objections to the fists of appointees, it was revised, and General Meadel name again sent in by the President. Dining March, the Senate, in Executive Session, confirmed the appointment, and General Meade took his rank and commission as MajorGeneral of United States' volunteers, from the 29th of November, 1862, and assumed the command of the fifth army corps.

When General Hooker assumed command of the army of the

Potomac and reorganised the same, he retained General Meade as the

commander of the fifth army corps, General Butterfield having

obtained a position on the Stat of the commanding officer. During the advance upon Chanceilorsville General Meade's corps formed part of the right wing of Hooker's army. The corps started on its march on the 20th day of April, 1863, and arrived at Kelly's Ford on the 28th. The next day it crossed the Rappaliannock by that ford and the Rapidan by bly's Ford. It then pushed on to Chancelloraville, where it arrived on the 30th and engaged the skirmishers of the Confederates, taking their rifle-pits and temporary wOrks. During the fearful contests of May 2, 3, and 4 General Meade's corps played its part in the same distinguished manner that had characterised the troops under his special command since the commencement of the war. It bore its part manfully, and in tkeendcovered theretreat of the whole of Hooker's army. During the subsequent heavy forced march General Measles troops bore up under the burning rays of nearly a tropical sun; and, although other corps straggled and hung back, Meade's corps held its own.

On the morning of June 28 Colonel Hardie arrived by special train

from Washington, as bearer of despatches relieving General Hooker from the command of the army of the Potomac and appointing Major-General Meade his successor.

The despatches from America recently published show that General

hteade is equal to the duties of his high position. Starting in pursuit

of the Confederate army, under General Lee, which had invaded Maryland and Pennsylvania, the rival forces met at Gettysburg. A series of fierce assaults made by the Confederates on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of July were repelled; General Lee was constrained to fall back on the Potomac, and, as we learn this week, has withdrawn his anoVfrinia,learirgabrigadeof infantry, with two guns, in the Uds of
In the course of a debate in the Rouse of Common some

time ago, Mr. Laird stated that soon after the outbreak of the civil war in America a gentlemen from the United States waked upon him "with the view of getting vessels built in this country for the Federal Government." Mr. Welles, the Federal Secretary to the Navy, has written a letter, in which he states that no person was ever authorised by the Northern Government to' apply to Mr. Laird, or any other foreign builder, to supply ships to the United States. On the other hand, the Navy Department had been solicited for orders by persons professing to represent Bnglish ship-building dries; and Mr. WeUea has an" indistinct remembrance" that "more than one person" "Importuned" on behalf of the Messrs. Lalrd. But he "pursued a uniform and undeviating policy in regard to each and all of those applications, declining, in every instance, any proposition to bold, or procure to be built, vessels for our (Federal) navy abroad." Mr. Laird, however, adheres to his original statement, and has offered to place In Lord Palmerston's hands the documents upon which he relies for the vindication of his veracity. He has since replied to the letter of the Federal Secretary to the Navy, by publishing what we presume are the documents he offered to place in the bands of Lord Palmerston, with the view of showing that he only stated the truth when ho told the Rouse of Commons that overtures had been made to him for the construction of ships of war for the service of the United States. Mr. Laird withholds for the present the name of the gentleman who represented himself to be the authorised agent of Mr. Gideonwelles; but we infer from one of the letters that the hon. gentleman may yet consider himself bound, In selfdefence, to make a disclosure which, in the interest of his correspondent he has been anxious to avoid. Mr. Lard further states that If any person bas "Importuned" the American Navy Department in behalf of his firm, he has done so without any authority.
AMERICA, WAIt NItWIt

We have intelligence from New York to the evening of uly 25

The position and intentions of General Lee were at that date somC what doubtful. It was at one time thought that he was rapiCl1Y retreating down the west side of the Shenandoah Valley, and General Me&le crossed the Potomac at Harper's Perry, and moved down the western side of the Blue Ridge to intercept him; but it was fOU1

that the Confederate General was closely hugging the line of the Upper Potomac, and fears were entertained of another invasion

Maryland. Another conjecture was that he had delayed there tO

carry across his plunder and to carry away the new crop of that fertile valley, and that lie intended to cross the mountains into Baste

Virginia at Chester or Thornton Gap. In that case probably a battle

Xelv. who was superintending the construction of the

PItiimrc e'l Ohio Railroad, was driven back by the Confederates r tin inic from North Mountain to Hancock. General Gregg had encmm :rul General Stuart's cavalry, 10,000 strong, between lhq hcr1'rown and Martineburg. An obstinate fight ensued, General (rrg holding his ground, but suffering heavy losses.

The daring raid of Morgan into Ohio has, according to one account, come to an abrupt termination. General Shackleford officially reports that he chased General Morgan over fifty miles, bringing him to a stand, when a fight ensued which lasted an hour. At the expiration cif that time the Confederates fled, taking refuge upon a high bluff. ( neral Skacklef,,rd demanded the immediate and unconditional surrender of Morgan and his forces. They surrendered with the excepth a of Morgan, who deserted his command, taking with him a: small squadron. General Shackleford captured 1504) to 2004) prisoners. But General Morgan. who was thus annihilated, was, at the last advices, still marauding Ohio at the head of a large force.

An extensive Federa" cavalry expedition left Newbern on the 18th alt, to penetrate into North Carolina, destroying bridges and railroad communication. The expedition burned the railroad bridge over the

Tar River and 5000 bales of cotton. Another Federal cavalry expe-dition, after severe fighting, captured and destroyed Wytheville, South-Eastern Virginia, taking 100 prisoners and two pieces of stilllery. They cut the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad at Wytheville.

 From Charleston the accounts are conflicting-one version affirming that Fort Wagner still holds out, and the other that the whole of Morris Island has been captured by the Federals. The Charleston papers assert that the city will be defended street by street. The whole coloured population had been impressed to work on the defences. I

The main interest of the news from America is with respect to

the feeling in the South. According to a Richmond journal the 100,000 Southern men who had paid for substitutes for military service must thcnieelves be draughted. Dictatorial powers are claimed for President.: Davis, and martial law insisted on for the whole Confederacy. In Alabama, South Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia it was announced that the people were organising actively for defence. The Vew' Orleans Era says President Davis has issued a proclamation ordering all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five to repair to the conscript camps. The Richmoe Inquirer speaks of a Navy Company having been formed, the object of which is to put as many privateers as possible upon the sea to pre- upon Federal commerce. This paper contemplates the disintegration of the great Southern armies and a conscquent guerrilla warfare, which should be principally upon the sea.

The news from Mississippi Valley shows that the Federals are following up their late successes. General Johnston, retreating from the neighbourhood of Vicksburg, threw his array into Jackson, where he held the Federals at bay for more than a week. On the 16th he evacuated the town, and his pursuers gave up further chase of him. The Richmond Whig says that the evacuation of Jacksoti left in the enemy's hands the rolling stock of the Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern, Mississippi-Central, and Mississippi-Tennessee Railroad. Over forty engines were lost. "The loss," continues the Richmond Whig, "is incalculable, important, and wholly irreparable."

 The garrison of Port Hudson, when they surrendered, had eaten

their last mule. The moment the surrender was completed the enemy

sent out a request that nix thousand rations should immediately be sent in, as the garrison had eaten its last mule. This was found to be literally the fact.

We have further tidings of the operations of the Confederate cruiser

Georgia. That vessel had, since our last news of her, captured three American vessels, two of which were released, whilst the third, which was laden with coal-an article of the greatest value to her captorwas being emptied, with the view, it is alleged, of fitting her also out as a privateer. The steamer lizzie has been captured off Abaco, and the steamer Kate Dale off Portugal, with 800 bales of cotton. The City of New York has arrived out. The Scotia has been intercepted off Cape Race.

rnB LATE DiOTS iK 1EW YORK.

New York is again quiet, and the negroes have once more begun to show themselves in the streets. The Common Council have passed a

series of resolutions, voting a fund of 500,000 dollars to pay the 300-:

dollar exemption fee for such as are not able to pay for themselves, and pledging themselves to try the validity of the Conscription Acts. Mr. Opdyke, the Mayor, vetoed the resolutions; but it is supposed they will be carried again by two-thirds of the body, which will annul the veto. It was supposed that the draught would recommence in a week. Coloured men will not be accepted as substitutes for white draughted men. The Mayor has offered a reward of 500 dollars for the apprehension of any person who committed murder or arson during the late riots. A subscription has been opened for the relief of coloured people. Governor Seymour, in a special order, had released the special constabulary from further duty, and states that a sufficient force of the State militia had arrived to maintain order. Pears, suspicions, and jealousies are mentioned as existing respecting the designs of Governor Seymour with respect to his contested right to the control of the State militia

In a list of losses by incendiary fires seventeen distinct fires are enumerated, comprising one or more buildings, and the estimated loss is 400,000 dollars. Fifty-six patients have been taken to the Bellevue Hospital, of whom thirteen have died. Fifteen dead bodies have been placed in the dead-house of the hospital; the names are unknown. Most of the injured seem to have received gunshot wounds. About thirty persons concerned in the riots have been captured by General Brown, and are held as military prisoners. It is stated, however, that they will be handed over to the civil authorities. More than 200 rioters were shot or bayoneted.

The New York Hsrald has resumed it silly gasconade about a

union between North arid South to make war on France said England.

It aSSerts that the conscription will be enforced, not to put down the rebellion, but to meet the threats of England, as the Government is deteimineci no longer to suffer privateers to be fitted out in that country. The seine journal urges the Government to grant the Confederates all their tights, under the Constitution, and at once proclaim war against Prance and England.

MISC LLAxEor.

The department of Virginia has been annexed to that of North Carolina, and placed under the control of General Foster, whose head-quarters will hereafter be at Fortress Monroe.

A steamer had arrived at New Orleans from Natcher, and left on a return trio to St. Louis, thus demonstrating the reopening of the Mississippi.

The World announces that General Meade tendered his resignation to the President as soon as he discovered that General Lee had crossed the Potomac, but that the President refused to accept it.

The United States' District Court has affirmed the decisions of the Lower Court, condemning the steamers Onachita and Elizabeth, the schooner J. S. Toone, the brig Sarah Star, and the car-¡o belonging to Mr. D. Evans, but has reversed the decision eonemning the cargo belonging to Mr. Monroe.

Mr. Vallaucligham, in an address from Niagara, accepts the

nomination for Governor of Ohio. He says that, after his ournayings, he found himself a free man, on British soil, arid exercised the pr-i. -vilegea and rights the usurper had denied him at home. He denies the practicability of subjugating the South by force of arms, and states that he met in the South not a man, woman, or ohild who was not resolved to perish rather than yield to force. He met no one in the South. whatever his opinions or station, political or private, who did not declare his readiness, when war thaI 1 have ceased and the invading armies are withdrawn, to consider and discuss the question of reuukn.

The brother of Mr. Vallandigham, a elergym ito, together with a Dr. Clarke. were arrested on the 17th, at Newark, Delaware, but were released upon taking the oath of allegiance. No cause was assigned for the arrest.
