<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Europa we are in receipt of papers to the 13th

and telegrams to the 15th, inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CAPTURE OF BEAUFORT.</p>

<p>Of the eighty-four transports and war-vessels which constituted the naval expedition when it set sail from Hampton Roads seventy-five arrived safely in the harbour of Port Royal, on the coast of South Carolina, about midway between Charleston and Savannah. The bombardment commenced on the 7th inst., and, after a fight of four hours, the Confederates abandoned the forts at the entrance to the inlet, and retreated precipitately. The Federals captured two forts, forty-three guns, military equipments, charts, and other valuable papers. The Confederates complain that their artillery was badly served, while that of their enemies was ably handled. The Federals in the attack lost only one gun-boat, whose hands were all saved. On the following day the Federal army, numbering 15,000 men, landed and established themselves at Beaufort, the seaside resort of the platers. The settlement, together with the neighbouring plantations, had been totally destroyed by the Confederates. Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp. The loss of life seems to have been small. The Federals set down their loss at eight; that of the Confederates is loosely estimated at a hundred. The small fleet of the Confederates, commanded by Commodore Tatnall, took no part in the action. Many of them escaped up the inlet leading to the Savannah river, others were run ashore, and the remainder were intercepted by the Federal vessels. Of the nine Federal vessels which were disabled en route, seven returned to Fortress Monroe, and two were wrecked on the coast of North Carolina. One of these contained ordnance stores, the other, troops to the number of 75 (who were taken prisoner) and horses, of whom all were lost except 15.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND</p>

<p>In Western Virginia the town of Guyandotte, on the Ohio River, was attacked by 600 Confederates, and, out of 150 Union troops stationed there, 100 were either killed or taken prisoners. The Confederates then retreated, when a loyal regiment retook the town and set fire to it, reducing the greater part to ashes.</p>

<p>At Piketown, the capital of Pike county, Kentucky, the easternmost county in the State, General Nelson (Federal) defeated General Williams's forces and took their leaders prisoners, The Secessionists lost 400 killed and a large number of prisoners.</p>

<p>A battle took place in Missouri on the 7th, of which the accounts are very unsatisfactory. It appears that an expedition left the Federal camp at Cairo, Illinois, and landed at Belmont, in Missouri, nearly opposite Columbia. The expedition numbered about 3500 men, and made an attack on a Confederate camp, numbering, they say, 7000. The enuny were driven out of their entrenchments, and their camp destroyed. As the Federals were retiring, booty laden, they were taken in the rear by a body of Confederates and compelled to retreat to their boats, leaving their booty to the enemy. The Federals admit a  loss of from 300 to 500 in killed, wounded, and missing.</p>

<p>The army of the West has not advanced beyond Springfield. General Halleck, of California, hss been appointed to command it. He is one of the four Major-Generals of the regular army of the United States. He entered the army in 1839, and is now about forty-two years of age. He has written two works on military matters, and till recently was practising law in San Francisco. General Fremont, on his return to St. Louis, received an ovation from the Germans of that city.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SOUTHERN COAST.</p>

<p>The late gale, in which the North Briton was lost, raged with almost unexampled severity at Hatteras Inlet, and the high tide had overflowed the space outside the forts to such an extent that a new channel was being formed between them. It was apprehended that the forts might thus be rendered untenable. Some clothing and stores taken down from Fortress Monroe for the use of the Indiana regiment stationed there were washed away, after being landed, and lost. The ocamp of this regiment was submerged and everything it contained washed away. The regiment has since been brought back to Monroe. Much sickness prevails among the occupying force on hatteras.</p>

<p>The Southern journals report the arrival of the Confederate steamer Theodora at Savannah with a valuable cargo of stores.</p>

<p>The steamer Bermuda escaped from Charleston with a cargo of rosin and turpentine and 2000 bales of cotton. She was permitted to take a cargo of cotton as a mark of gratitude for the valuable supply of arms and ammunition she had brought; but, as a general rule, ships running the blockade for Europe are not allowed by the people to take cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis and Vice-President Stephens have been re-elected to the positions they now severally occupy.</p>

<p>Judah P. Benjamin has been appointed Secretary for War.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEFENCE OF THE COASTS.</p>

<p>Governor Curtin, of Pennsylvania, has written a caustic reply to Mr. Seward's circular letter. He objects to corresponding by slips cut from newspapers; he is surprised that the late Congress was not solicited to pass appropriations for this purpose if things were more menacing then than now. He says that he does not feel himself justified in calling a special Session of the State Legislature, while Congress will reassemble a month before the regular Session of the fotmer body. The whole subject of coast defences could only be dealt with by the general Government. Even if the States were to undertake the job, the competition in the money markets for loans between the nation and the States would be very injurious to both. Pennsylvania had already advanced considerable sums for raising volunteers, and the Federal Government had thrown great difficulties in the way of repayment. On the whole, he suggests the abandonment of Mr. Seward's plan.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The captain of the slaver Erie had been convicted of the capital offence by a New York jury. This is remarkable as being the only conviction of the kind since 1820 when the traffic was declared piracy by Congress. Another trial for a similar crime is progressing in New Bedford.</p>

<p>In New Jersey the Democratic party had carried the State. In Maryland the Union ticket prevailed. To this result the surveillance exercised over the polls by General Dix's troops greatly contributed.</p>
<p>A memorial was in circulation in St. Louis, asking Congress to relieve Missouri from the national taxes, because her citizens have already suffered so seriously from the war.</p>

<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuters's office yesterday (Friday):-</p>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the Steamer City of New York, which arrived at Queenstown on Thursday, we have intelligence from New York to the 15th inst:-</p>

<p>There is no conclusive evidence of the occupation of Beaufort by the Federals. The Charleston papers of the 12th inst. deny that the Federals have occupied the town, and state that reinforcements had been sent thither by the Confederates who were preparing to defend the town. The Federals, however, have occupied Hilton Island, the cotton crop on which was found to have been fired by the residents before leaving. The <hi rend="italics">Charleston Courier</hi> says there is little cotton stored at or near Beaufort. The New York journals state that the Federal Government has not determined whether Beaufort shall be made a port of entry. The Southern journals state that black flags have been hoisted at Charleston and Savannah as an indication that no quarter would be given and that none would be asked.</p>

<p>Eighteen Federal officers, prisoners of war at Richmond, have been selected to be hung, should the Federal Government hang the crew of the privateer Savannah.</p>

<p>Confirmatory accounts have been received of bridge-burning on a most extensive scale by the Union men of East Tennessee, Missouri.</p>

<p>The Federal army has evacuated Springfield, Missouri, returning to St. Louis.</p>

<p>It is reported that a United States' war-vessel has captured a large British steamer, supposed to be the Fingal, laden with arms, at Key West.</p>

<p>Colonel Cochrane, in addressing his regiment at Washington, urged the arming of the Southern slaves against their masters. The Secretary for War was present on the occasion, and is reported to have fully endorsed Colonel Cochrane's speech.</p>

<p>A despatch from Fortress Monroe reports the arrival of the United States' steam-sloop-of-war San Jacinto, with Messrs. Slidell and Mason on board.</p>

<p>The reported battle at Pikeville, Kentucky, was very much exaggerated. There were no killed, and the number of wounded and prisoners is reduced to 80 and 50 respectively.</p>

<p>The report of the capture of the Sumter has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>S<hi rend="smallcaps">TARTLING</hi> news has been brought by the West Indian mail steamer La Plata, which arrived at Southampton on Wednesday. On the 8th inst. Mr. Slidell, the accredited commissioner to France from the Confederate States, and Mr. Mason, engaged on a similar mission to France, with their respective secretaries, Messrs. Eustis and M'Farland-who had run the blockade at Charleston and arrived at Havannah on the 18th ult., were forcibly taken out of the British mail-steamer Trent by the commander of the American steam-frigate San Jacinto.</p>

<p>It appears that on the 7th inst. the Trent sailed in her regular course of service from Havnnah for St. Thomas. On the following day, while the Trent was approaching a narrow passage in the Bahama Channel, a large steam-ship of war, which showed no colours, was seen waiting ahead. The Trent hoisted the British ensign, but elicited no responsive display of colours until she had approached within about 200 yards of the strange ship, which then fired a shot across the Trent's bow, hoisted the United States' flag, and fired a shell to leeward of the Trent. Captain Moir, the commander of the Trent, hailed the United States' steamer's captain, who replied that he wished to send a boat on board. A boat, containing two officers and ten men, boarded the Trent; and the boat's commanding officer, Lieutenant Fairfax, demanded to inspect the passenger-list, but was refused permission. He then declared that his commander, Captain Wilks, of the United States' steam-ship San Jacinto, had received information that Messrs. Shideil, Mason, Eustace, and M'Farland were among the passengers, and required that they should be given up to him. Captain Moir and Commander Williams, the naval officer in charge of the mails, refused to comply with the requisition; and the Confederate Commissioners, who were standing near, claimed the protection of the British flag under which they were sailing. Lieutenant Fairfax said he would take charge of the Trent, and made a signal to the San Jacinto, which immediately dispatched several armed boats, containing about 100 marines and seamen, who with drawn cutlasses boarded the Trent, arrested the Confederate Commissioners, and forced them into the boats. While this was doing, Commander Williams protested against the act in the following terms:-</p>

<p>In this ship I am the representative of her Majesty'S Governmsnt, nd I call upon the officers of the ship and passengers generally to mark my words when, in the name of the British Government, and in distinct language, I denounce this as an illegal act, an act in violation of international law-an act, indeed, of wanton piracy, which, had we the means of defence, you would not dare to attempt.</p>

<p>Mr. Slidell, as he was forced into the boat, requested the Trent's Captain to report exactly what had occurred, and declared that he looked to the British Government for redress for the outrage committed upon him while he was under the protection of the British flag. The American officers next complained that they were short of provisions, and asked for a supply for their prisoners, which was given by Captain Moir for the "exclusive use " of Messrs. Slidell, Mason, Eustis, and M'Farland. Lieutenant Fairfax said that he was ordered to take Captain Moir and his papers on board the San Jacinto; but Captain Moir refused to go unless he was forcibly removed from his quarterdeck. Lieutenant Fairfax thereupon told Captain Moir that he wanted nothing further, and ordered his men into the boats, which returned to the San Jacinto, leaving the Trent to prosecute her voyage.</p>

<p><hi rend="italics">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 30, 1861.</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has been for some time rumoured that a vessel of war bearing the flag of the Federal States of America was lying in the track of our West India mail-steamers with the intention of searching them for certain commissioners sent by the Confederate States to Europe. The statement was received with a good deal of incredulity, and the surprise and indignant feeling have been proportionably strong at the intelligence of the course pursued by the Commander of the San Jacinto towards the mail-packet Trent. Apart from the violation of right and the insult to the British flag which are necessarily involved in this transaction, there would appear to have been a savageness in the mode in which the proceedings were conducted, from which we are inclined to augur that the American officers were actuated by that feeling which generally induces persons who are doubtful whether they are in the right to overdo their parts. It is quite clear that it needed not the additional circumstances of ferocity implied in firing, first round shot and then shell, at an unarmed steamer, merely for the purpose of bringing her to; or the personal violence which is reported to have been used in the arrest of Mr. Slidell in particular, to elicit in a manner not to be mistaken the spirit of this country in regard to this proceeding. The most decided indications of public opinion have been afforded that England will not tamely submit to have her vessels boarded and passengers forcibly torn from beneath the protection of her flag. If, as has been asserted, it has been the object and design of the Federal Government to force Great Britain into an attitude of hostility, without question full reason and justification has been now afforded. Such an act, if done under the direct sanction and authority of the Executive at Washington, speaks for itself. Neither of the parties can desire a more complete "casus belli." It remains to be seen whether the proceedings of the commander of the San Jacinto will be adopted or disavowed by his Government. It is well known that American naval officers have been always somewhat hasty in asserting what they conceive to be the rights of their country; and in many cases it has been necessary on the part of those representatives of other countries with whom they have come into collision to exercise great forbearance. When the matter is looked at, considered with that coolness and calmness which its importance requires, it seems almost impossible to suppose that so flagrant a trespass on the rights which by international law are covered by a flag can have been deliberately planned by the American Government, or that when temperate but firm demands made for the disavowal of conduct on the face of it so unjustifiable on all grounds but one-that of seeking occasion for a quarrel-that disavowal will not be given. Notwithstanding the indignant feeling which has been evinced in this country on the receipt of this intelligence, there is no doubt that the gravity of the consequences which may ensue will be acknowledged by every Englishman. It is to be hoped that in the Northern States of America a corresponding feeling will prevail.</p>
-------
-------

<p>By the capture of Beaufort, the summer resort of Carolinian planters, the United States' Government have fully avenged the insult of Fort Sumter. In April the solo remiaining star-spangled banner on South Carolinian Soil was ignominiously lowered. In November the United States' flag has again been hoisted there, while that of the Confederates trails in the dust. But the war, in its ever-expanding magnitude, has long since outgrown the puerile issue on which it was commenced. The passionate resolve to redress an outrage inflicted on the Federal flag has long since deepened into a purpose of conquest. It would be a chimerical to hope that this success would tend to placate the North as that the forcible opening of a Southern port will lead to a renewal of the Southern trade with Europe.</p>

<p>This time, at least, the blow has fallen in the right place. Hitherto the border States-Maryland, Virginia (East and West), Kentucky, and Missouri-have alone felt the ravages which attend the shock of invading armies. Yet all these regions, except Eastern Virginia, are still in the Union. It has been the fate of the border Slave States to act as a sort of breakwater to the fury of the Northern storm behind which the revolutionary Gulf States dwelt in safety and comparative repose. On the Northern frontier of Secessia was the " shell" with which the far South incased its softer and more vital parts. All attempts to break through that shell by a front attack have hitherto failed. But the fleet has accomplished what the unaided army could not. South Carolina is the very heart and focus of the revolution, and the Isle of Anglesca of old was not more given up to Druidical worship than are the sea islands, on one of which the Federals are encamped, consecrated to slave-grown products. Negroes, rice, and the finest sorts of cotton-these are the pride and glory of Beaufort county, situated midway between Charleston and Savannah, the two principal southern ports on the Atlantic coast. Full five-sixths of the population of Beaufort county are slaves.</p>

<p>The angry North has at last condescended to carry the war into "Africa." In the border Slave States, where slavery is not of vigorous growth, the Administration and every General, except the deposed Fremont, have been sedulous to deprive the war of an anti-slavery character. But in this thickly-settled region, where slavery flourishes rankly, the Northern army of occupation must, in the very nature of things, and in spite even of the ingrained prejudices of the men composing it, become an instrument of emancipation. Already the telegraph tells us " Large numbers of negroes came into the Federal camp." These late chattels will not be restored to their owners. The Federal Government, which, in the border States, restores fugitives to "loyal" owners, rightly conjectures there are  no loyal proprietors in South Carolina, and at length allows its camp to be a gladsome City of Refuge to all who may flock thither. The slaves of this region, removed by a whole heaven from Canada, had no hope of escape from thraldom but death. A host of men from the North, contending for empire and a flag, but stung by the repulses at Bull Run and Ball's Bluff, suddenly appear in the midst of the negroes, consent to abandon their practice of slave-catching, and fastidiously resign themselves to the inevitable consequence that a chance of freedom will thereby be opened to a more or less numerous band of a downtrodden race. Had the midsummer cry of "Forward to Richmond!" availed we should never have heard of this autumnal invasion of the South Carolina coast. Adversity has taught the North to conquer one poor iota of her prejudices. It is this aspect of the camp at Beaufort which will give it an interest in the eyes of the onlooking world superior to that attaching to to Fortress Monroe, Hatteras Inlet, and Fort Pickens.</p>

<p>The second success of the fleet will be highly welcome to the Administration and the Commander-in-Chief, for two reasons- one political and one military. The Northern people had again grown impatient at the inaction or disasters of the two armies on the Lower and Upper Potomac. They demanded a victory, and demanded it in vain. General M'Clellan obstinately inculcated "patience," that virtue so difficult for an excited Democracy to observe. The universal feeling was," Something must be done; we want some equivalent for our money and other sacrifices." Popular enthusiasm threatened to flag, the subscriptions to the national loan fell off, and murmurs against the Administration began to make themselves heard. The achievements of the fleet will calm this dangerous mood of the public mind and give the Commander-in-Chief a few more weeks to mature his plans. In a military point of view, the 15,000 men at Beaufort will operate as an invaluable diversion of the enemy's forces. The invaders are within sixteen miles' distance of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad, whose wooden bridges and trestle-work are easily destructible, and whose iron tires if once thrown into the river cannot now be replaced. The Confederates have to make head against a force of, say, 350,000 Federals pressing upon them on a line of 1500 miles, stretching from the Atlantic to the Missouri. Up to the present time they have done so with a fair amount of success. But can the Confederate Generals create new armies to watch every body of men whom the Federal fleet may throw upon their almost undefended coast? Or can they detach a sufficient number of men from the frontier without leaving the road to Richmond, Nashville, and Memphis open to their foes? It is evident that General Scott, for one, does not so believe, for his last words to time New Yorkers were, that by April or May next the "rebellion" would be surely crushed.</p>

<p>If the South still preserves the advantage of greater earnestness and singleness of purpose, the superior financial strength of the North begins to tell. The appeal of the planters to the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury and the reply thereto are signs that the South is "shortwinded" in this respect. Doubtless this difficulty would vanish if the South could make sale of her cotton, rice, and tobacco; but here the Federal fleet sails in and pitilessly relegates the South to her native resources. The Federal Government is well supported by the banks of the three chief cities of the North, and the people relieve the banks of the seven-and-three-tenths per cent Treasury notes nearly, but not quite, so fast as they are issued Northern patriotism, as expressed in <pb n="540"/>

the readiness to take the Government loan, has by no means equalled the superabundant enthusiasm we are accustomed to witness in France on similar occasions, but seems to have exceeded the lagging offerings of the Italians for their late loan. American national sentiment, valued in dollars, stands midway between that of France and Italy. The immense quantities of grain and flour which the North has all this year been selling to British and French purchasers keep the exchange in favour of the Americans, and enable their banks, in spite of the stoppage of the usual export from the South, to retain the specie in their vaults. Thus confidence is maintained; the banks have not suspended specie payments and, notwithstanding Mr. Seward's uncalled-for and reckless circulars, Government and railroad stocks of loyal States are higher now than they have been since the Presidential election.</p>

<p>In the mean time, among the mountains of Western Virginia a revolutionary movement has been progressing which is independent, to some extent, of both North and South. The people of thirty-nine contiguous counties of the trans-Allegheny section of Virginia, occupying an area about twice the size of Wales, and numbering 282,000, of whom only 9000 are slaves, have declared their independence of the State of Virginia, and, organised themselves, with great unanimity, into a new state, called Kanawha, from the river of that name, which traverses it. Although the Kanawhans occupy a territory of giant value to the United States, and although the region has been liberated from Confederate armies by M'Clellan and Rosencranz, yet this demonstration meets with no favour from the Federal Government, which cannot now afford to countenance the right of revolution, even when it is made in behalf of the Union and the old flag. Separated as these people are from Eastern Virginia by physical barriers similar to those which divide Savoy from Italy, and united to the adjacent free-labour States by similar pursuits and moral and political sympathies, it is very improbable, come what may, that the old territorial arrangements will ever be restored. But the incident furnishes another proof that the air of America was charged with revolution, and that the time was ripe for a recombination of the heterogeneous elements of which the United States for the last forty years have been composed.</p>

<P>M<hi rend="smallcaps">UCH</hi> interest is felt in the recent determination of the Federal Government to fortify its coast, lake, and frontier line, as conveyed in Mr. Seward's instructions of the 14th of October. The American Government, however, have for some time past been repairing and enlarging the system of fortifications on the Canadian frontier. One of the strongest of the enlarged works is Fort Montgomery, at Rowse's Point, at the head of Lake Champlain. This fort has been nicknamed Fort Blunder, because erected upon British soil, afterwards given up, under treaty, to the United States. The fort has been considerably enlarged, and is now nearly completed. It will mount sixty-five guns in position, and twenty-five en barbette. It is protected on the land side by a moat and rampart of earth; and, on the whole, it is a very formidable work. Rowse's Point is about thirty-eight miles from Montreal, and upon the main line of railway communication between Boston, New York, and Canada. Lake Champlain, which lies between the States of New York and Vermont, extending for four miles into Lower Canada, is 105 miles in length, north to south, its breadth varying from ten miles to half a mile. It contains numerous islands, receives several rivers, and discharges its superfluous waters by the Richelieu river into the St. Lawrence. This lake was the centre of  many important military operations during the revolutionary war, and now forms an important medium of commerce.</p>
