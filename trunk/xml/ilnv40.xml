<p rend="center">THE PAST YEAR.</p>
<p>...And here it becomes necessary to infuse into our domestic chronicle
a foreign element. The disruption of the United States of America in
the spring, and the consequent civil war, has had an obvious bearing
on our interests and our policy. The path of neutrality and of
non-interference has been a narrow and a difficult one for our
statesmen to tread, owing to circumstances over which England has no
control, and to which we do not think it necessary now to do more than
allude. Unhappily, the affair of the Trent has left us in such a
position that on the first day of the new year we were anxiously
awaiting intelligence which would bear with it the issues of peace or
war with a kindred people. At this point it will not be out of place
to advert to the attitude which France has adopted towards this
country, one of loyal alliance and coincidence of opinion, which,
spontaneously expressed, has been followed by Austria and Prussia,
and, therefore, may be said to have gained the acceptance of the
majority of the Great Powers of Europe. Nor should we pass over the
remarkable signs which are apparent of a new era in the administration
of the affairs of France, taking a direction which can be traced to
the insensible influence of England; while the expansion of our trade
with our nearest neighbour, owing to the recent arrangements between
the two countries, has been such as to promise almost to compensate
for the, we trust temporary, loss of our commercial dealings wit 
h America.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Africa we have news from New York to the 10th
ult. This steamer was detained for thirty-six hours by Lord Lyons in
order to take out dispatches.</p>

<p rend="center">HOW THE NEWS FROM EUROPE WAS RECEIVED.</p>

<p>The steam-ship Europa arrived at Halifax on the morning of Sunday,
Dec. 15, bringing European advices to Dec. 2. A very full summary of
the opinions of the English press on the Mason and Slidell case, and
the important decision of the British Government, as well as the
opinion of the law officers of the Crown, was telegraphed to New York
and Washington, where the news was received on Sunday afternoon. No
journals were published, however, on Sunday; but the nature of the
news gained currency through private circles, and caused intense
excitement&#x2014;the more so as the previous advices per Hansa had led the
public to believe that there would be no difficulty with England on
this question.</p>
<p>A full telegraphic summary was published in the American journals
of Monday, Dec. 16, and the Mason and Slidell case became the
absorbing topic of the day. The press and the public generally seem to
deprecate war with England, and to cling to a vague idea that the
matter would be settled by some diplomatic arrangement. Unanimity at
first, however, appeared to prevail among the press and public upon
the most important part of the question&#x2014;namely, the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and the universal opinion was that the
"national honour" of the country could never permit the surrender of
the prisoners under any circumstances whatever.</p>
<p>The following day, Dec. 17, the feeling universally was much calmer
and quieter throughout all circles, and the general opinion was that
war would certainly not ensue; the idea of giving up Messrs. Mason and
Slidell was even discussed, and its probability entertained, the
argument being, if the Federal Government was in the wrong in taking
these men, there is no disgrace in surrendering them; and if they were
right, the question can be discussed or settled by arbitration.</p>
<p>The Europa's mails were delivered in New York Dec. 18, and their
contents closely scrutinised. Captain Seymour, Queen's messenger,
and Mr. Cooke, messenger from Mr. Adams, arrived in New York on the
morning of Dec. 18, and at once left for Washington by special train,
where they arrived at midnight.</p>
<p>The tone of the New York morning journals of Dec. 18 was materially
changed on the Mason and Slidell question, and a degree of moderation
was observable in discussing the subject very different from the articles of the few previous weeks.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th news from England to Dec. 6 was
telegraphed from Portland, and the announcement of the formidable
warlike progress being made in Great Britain again created great excitement.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EFFECT ON THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES.</p> 

<p>The bankers began to discuss the propriety of suspending cash
payments, and held a meeting immediately to come to a decision
thereupon. The New York Bank statement of the 16th showed that a large
decrease of their stock of specie (to the amount of nearly 3,000,000
dols.) had taken place, although there had been no shipments to
Europe. It was perceived that hoarding had commenced; nevertheless,
the banks of the three chief cities agreed to continue for the present
to meet their obligations in coin if demanded.</p>

<p>In the Stock Market there was a general fall of about three per
cent, and in some instances of from five to six per cent. Sterling
exchange rose to 111. In the Produce Market saltpetre advanced to
15c. per pound; and at the public sales brimstone, tea, and coffee
were withdrawn.</p>

<p>On the 18th Secretary Chase arrived in New York, and was closeted
with the bankers all day. What passed at the interview was studiously
concealed from the public except that Mr. Chase assured the bankers
that the demands of England would not be made an occasion of war by
the Cabinet of Washington.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons had not had any interview with the Secretary of State up
to the hour of the steamer's leaving; but the American Cabinet had had
several protracted sittings, the spirit of which, according to public
rumour, tended towards a peaceful settlement. It is observed that the
Ambassadors of England, France, and Prussia did not attend the
President's levee.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The proceedings of this body have been important, both in a
domestic and international point of view. Mr. Lovejoy's motion
censuring General Halleck for his order forbidding slaves to enter his
camp was defeated in the House by 78 against 64. This is regarded as a
triumph of the Administrative and Conservative Republicans over the
Emancipationists. In the Senate a motion to inquire into the conduct
of the Secretary of State in causing the arrest of persons in the
loyal States was defeated by 25 against 17. The bill to grant 1000
dols. to the owners of the British ship Perthshire, for wrongful
detention, was passed by the House. Mr. Cox, in introducing the
measure, said "that the prompt action of Congress in awarding it is
intended as an earnest to Great Britain that this Government will he
as earnest to indemnify for a wrong as to defend a right." On the
16th, Mr. <sic>Vallandingham</sic>, of Ohio, a pro-slavery Democrat, introduced
resolutions calling upon the President to maintain the stand already
taken in regard to Captain Wilke's action, and pledging to him the
full support of the House in vindicating the courage of the Government
and people of the United States against a foreign Power. He moved the
previous question, but the resolutions were referred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs by a vote of 109 against 16, the mover and his
seconders voting in the negative. Nothing has yet been done by either
House towards carrying out the recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury concerning the emission of a national currency in lieu of the
bank-notes now in use.</p> 

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federal armies have made no movement of importance during the
week. The popularity of M'Clellan is decidedly on the wane. Ship
Island, at the mouth of the Mississippi, has been occupied by the
Federals. Neither General Burnside's expedition nor that which has
been organised to descend the Mississippi had yet sailed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>A terrible fire had broken out in Charleston, attributed to negro
incendiarism. Five hundred and seventy-six <sic>building</sic> were consumed,
including a majority of the churches and public buildings. The loss is
set down at 7,000,000 dollars. The case has been brought before the
Confederate Congress by a special message from President Davis, and a
sum of 250,000 dollars appropriated to the relief of the sufferers.</p>

<p>In Nashville gold is at a premium of 40, and silver of 35, per cent.</p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>

<p>Public opinion in Canada supports the stand taken by the British
Government. The Canadian papers brought by the American mail are full
of military news. Preparations for war are being made on all hands,
and volunteering is being carried on with admirable spirit.</p>

<p rend="center">LATEST NEWS FROM ABROAD.</p>
<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Renter's office
yesterday (Friday):&#x2014;</p>

<p> <hi rend="smallcaps">America</hi>.&#x2014;New York, Dec. 20,
Afternoon.&#x2014;(Per Anglo-Saxon, vi&#xE2; Portland and Londonderry.)A
battle is reported to have taken place in Missouri in which 1300
Confederates, finding themselves surrounded by the Federal forces,
surrendered with their baggage and equipments. Reports are current
that the Confederates have evacuated Galveston. 120,000lb. of
sea-island cotton have arrived at New York from Beaufort:
400,000lb. more are reported ready to be shipped. Vice-President
Stephens, of the Southern Confederacy, is said to be seriously
ill. The projected Federal expedition under General Villes from
Beaufort has been abandoned. A treaty between America and Mexico is
reported to have been subjected to Congress, by which the Federal
Government agrees to pay Mexico 11,000,000 dollars to refund the
British and French claims. Mexico is to grant America commercial
privileges and permission to transport troops across the Mexican
territory.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Trent Affair</hi>.&#x2014;New York, Dec. 21.&#x2014;It is reported that
Lord Lyons has had several informal interviews with Mr. Seward, but
that no official communication on the subject of the Trent affair has
yet passed between them. It is rumoured that Mr. Seward sent a
communication to the British Government previous to the receipt of the
Europa's advices. The belief in a pacific solution is universal. The
New York <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> state that Messrs. Mason and Slidell will be
surrendered. The <hi rend="italic">World</hi> however, says that they
will not.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Annual Emigration Returns&#x2014;Extraordinary Falling- 
Off</hi>.&#x2014;On Wednesday the emigration
officials at Liverpool issued their annual returns of the emigration
from that port during the past year. At the beginning of the present
year, and indeed up to May, there was every promise that the exodus
from this port would equal, if not surpass, that of any previous
year. In May, however, the American crisis assumed a serious aspect,
and the emigration all at once dropped off; and from that period up to
the present time there has been a regular and continued decrease, and
now the emigration trade of the port is at a complete
standstill. Ships that formerly carried out their 500 to 700
passengers can now scarcely raise two dozen&#x2014;indeed, brokers will
scarcely take the trouble of having a vessel surveyed by the
Emigration Commissioners, though the expense is trifling. The number
of vessels sailing under the Act, or Government supervision, and
number of passengers they carried, are as follows:&#x2014;To the United
States, 139 vessels, of 220,213 tons burden, carried 1365 cabin and
26,212 steerage passengers; to Canada, seven vessels, 6720 tons,
carried 124 cabin and 1005 steerage passengers; to New South Wales,
two ships, 2344 tons, 526 steerage passengers; to Victoria, thirty
ships, 49,326 tons, 468 cabin and 9090 steerage passengers; to South
America, one ship, 287 tons, 8 cabin and 81 steerage passengers: making
a total of 179 ships, and 38,879 passengers. Of ships not under the
Act, 348 carried to various parts of the world 6761 cabin and 9387
steerage passengers&#x2014;16,148 passengers in all. Thus the total number of
passengers sailing under the Act was 38,879; and not under the Act,
16,148: 55,027 in all. Of these, 11,591 were English; 20,343 Irish;
2071 Scotch: the remainder belonged to other countries. In 1860 there
sailed under the Act 255 ships, 381,650 tons, 2796 cabin passengers
and 65,487 steerage passengers, or 68,283 passengers. In the same year
there left 15,491 passengers "not under the Act." Another feature of
this enormous decrease is, that whereas in former years people made
remittances to this country in order to assist their friends "at home"
to emigrate to the States, affairs are now reversed, and money is
forwarded through agents to bring people from America. The tide of
emigration to Australia flows slowly but steadily, and has hardly
received any impetus from the deranged state of American affairs.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">London, Saturday, January</hi> 4, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> events of the year having been
summarised in another part of our Impression, we have now to
complete the record by adding the latest news from the only part of
the world where events have at the moment a strong interest for
English readers. The arrival of the Africa places us in possession of
a large mass of details, which our contemporaries have sought to
arrange ingeniously, mosaic fashion, so as to present a picture of the
American mind with reference to the dispute with England. We do not
know, however, that the picture is a likeness, clever as is the
manipulation of material out of which it has been produced. The only
part which has, we think, been "reliably" (to use a vile word)
presented is that which indicates the surprise which has seized the
States at the attitude of this country. We have submitted so long, and
with such good-natured forbearance, to every caprice, whim, and
impertinence of our cousins that they had, not perhaps unreasonably,
concluded that we had lost sight of the truth that under some
circumstances patience ceases to be a virtue. We have shown, in
contradiction to the incessant allegations of the Transatlantic press,
that we did understand America and the nature of American
institutions; and that, though ourselves working with a responsible
Government, mutually dependent, and resting on the opinion of the
intellectual and solvent classes of society, we could make all
allowances for the difficult position of a Government under the
dictation of mobs, and abandoned by the culpable selfishness of the
respectable population. But the last outrage has been so flagrant that
not only is England aroused, but all the strong Governments of
Europe&#x2014;some of them little inclined to be friendly to us&#x2014;exclaim with
united voice that such a thing cannot be borne; and the intimation of
Earl Russell that there is a limit to our forbearance, though such
notification was a matter of indisputable necessity, has astonished
the Americans. The various utterances of the journals are not worth
collecting, except in so far as they reflect the opinion of the
peoples or may be supposed to be acceptable to it. The better men in
the States are said to have recognised the justice of our
demand, the Commander of the Army (at whom the Democratic party is
said to cast strange glances, as at a future Dictator who shall put
down the Abolitionists) having at once declared, it is alleged, that
Mr. Lincoln must restore the Commissioners and apologise to
England. But the formal delivery of the English demand would seem not
to have taken place when the Africa's bag was sealed. The Congress, so
ready the other day with a sycophantic compliment to Captain Wilks,
had refused by 109 to 16 to back up his "action" any further, and had
referred the question to the Government itself. Mr. Chase, the
American Gladstone, had assured the representatives of the financial
interest that the dispute would receive a speedy and pacific
solution. So far, therefore, things may be said to look a little
better; but it would be worse than foolish to augur that the danger of
war has passed away. We wish that we could believe the Seward party
wise enough and patriotic enough to consider the question only on its
merits. They have never given any proof of such a statesmanlike
disposition. They have sought nothing but popularity and the applause
of that part of the populace whose good opinion is a reproach to
honest men. Meantime they are being hard pressed by the Abolitionists,
who are more in earnest than any other section of the American public,
and who, naturally, are indignant that the slavery-hating Englishman
is placed in such a situation that he cannot sympathise with the
enemies of the slaveowner. It is hinted that the Abolitionists mean much
more active hostility to the Government, and already the alarmists on
the Seward side threaten the severest reprisals. With such foes close
upon them, and with the discontent which the impatient mob is showing
at the prudential inactivity of General M'Clellan (there were idiots,
even in the London Common Council, who assailed Lord Wellington in the
same way for his unmatched Peninsular tactics), and with a fearful
expenditure to provide for out of an almost empty treasury, the
position of the divided and intriguing Cabinet of Mr. Lincoln is far
from enviable. This is to be much regretted, because the fact may make
it impossible for the President to do what justice and true wisdom
dictate in regard to England. He may feel himself obliged to make
political capital, and refuse to yield the men, at the risk of
bringing down prompt chastisement from the armed hand of England. A
brilliant victory over the South at this moment would be the best
guarantee for peace between us and the Americans&#x2014;the national vanity
would be appeased and prudent counsels would have a chance of
prevailing. But there is small hope of anything of the kind; General
M'Clellan adheres to the Fabian system; and, though he counsels
justice, he takes no steps to do what alone would make justice
tolerated. In this, of course, we have no right to blame him. If his
own views of the future are such as are imputed to him&#x2014;and if they are
he is far too wise a man to give any sign of the kind&#x2014;he may not be
displeased to see the Government embarrassed by enemies whom it may be
his mission to put down. Thus the matter rests until fresh advices
arrive; and we repeat that the utmost that the last dispatches
permit us to say is, that the Americans are surprised at our energetic
protest against outrage, and seem inclined to consider that we may
have good grounds for action.</p>

<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi>, Dec. 6.</p> 
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A few</hi> hours after dispatching my last
letter I heard of an act which had I known of sooner would probably
have induced me to suppress much that I had written favourable
to the Union cause. A people's conceit had been overlooked by me in my
belief in a principle, and I had smothered much of that feeling which
most Englishmen are prone to after a probationary course of American
arrogance. Anxious to do my duty to your readers, and honestly to
publish my convictions, I have never for a moment allowed myself to be
carried away by acrimoniousness, and personally I have heard much that
is bitter for an Englishman to hear. As I have said before, I have
looked upon the Union as a principle that should and ought to be
preserved&#x2014;as an edifice, great and wonderful of its kind, built at the
cost of infinite intellect, wealth, and labour. Though the
architecture that has served for model in its construction may be
contrary to our notions of perfection, yet we cannot see a noble pile
destroyed without some feeling of compunction at its ruin. In this
spirit have my former letters been written.</p>
<p>Your readers are long before this aware that an English Royal Mail
steamer has been boarded by a United States' ship of war, and from
beneath the folds of the British flag four gentlemen belonging to the
"Southern Confederacy" have been forcibly removed. As to the legality
of this act I have nothing to say; it rests with the authorities on
international law to decide the question between the two Governments,
though as a subject of Great Britain I, with the captain of the Trent,
must protest against the violation of that flag which it is an
Englishman's creed to believe inviolable. But I have much to say in
reference to the bearing of the people of the Northern States since
they have been informed of this, according to their journals, "most
heroic achievement." It will make us all blush, when we turn back to
our chronicles of the sea, to find how utterly insignificant are the
deeds of our own naval commanders when compared to the brilliant
exploit of the Captain of the San Jacinto and her crew in boarding an
unarmed passenger-ship. I am not writing idly while giving utterance
to this sentiment. I am prompted to do so by the panegyrics pronounced
by one and all here on the deed which is to form "the brightest page
in contemporaneous history;" and, being in the minority, I must needs
bow deferentially to the opinions of the mass. But if, in the
minority, I might presume to express my own notions of what has been
done, I should suggest the idea that, if Captain Wilks be an honest,
true-hearted sailor, he must repudiate thoroughly, and with feelings
of something more than disgust, the vile and maudlin adulation of
those who would seek to magnify into Nelsonian proportions an event
which he, probably, estimating at its proper value, would soon have
forgotten. I am not going to quarrel with Captain Wilks for placing
himself in the position which has elevated him, through the absurdity
of his countrymen to the somewhat ludicrous pedestal on which he finds
himself. He no doubt considered he was doing his duty; and it remains
for Crown lawyers and other learned authorities to determine whether
he has done so or not.</p>
<p>When the first intelligence reached here of the capture of Slidell
and Mason, with their secretaries, the public excitement was greater
than anything I have witnessed throughout my experience of the
campaign. The arguments at the American Bar (rooms) went fast and
furious; the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> (few of the
latter) were bandied from one stump orator to another, and most of the
discussions ended in any amount of smashes (brandy-smashes, I mean),
while numerous skins (whisky skins) were roughly handled by judge and
jury. "Waal now, Mister, I guess that the overhauling of that
thaar Britisher is a big thing anyhow, and I'll be dogged
if Cap'n Wilks ain't been right smart to lay a hand on them skunks"
(meaning the Southern Commissioners). This opinion was of course
received with unanimous applause, when another gentleman moved "That
now Uncle Sam had got'em in his fist he should squeege 'em
pretty tight, and not mind nary international laws." Amongst the
better classes the feeling is just as strong in favour of what
has been done, and I have heard persons of consideration say that they
would rather see Slidell and Mason hanged in the face of an English
fleet than have them given up should international treaties place
England in a position to demand their surrender. But the other day I
overheard the following conversation in reference to the possible
recognition of the South, and the probable demand of England for
reparation to her flag:&#x2014;"Now, just look here: can't Pennsylvania
raise 800,000 men?" "Well, she can whip France, and I reckon New York
can fix England, and tother States can easily whip the South."</p>
<p>There is hardly a corporation in New York or Boston that has not
given a public reception to Captain Wilks. City halls have been turned
into josshouses, and the guest has been made the joss before whom
all have bent in wondering admiration. Historical societies have
thrown wide their portals, their members have assembled in solemn
conclave to welcome to their midst the hero of the hour, and with the
leaves of their ponderous tomes spread open, and goose-quills neatly
nibbed, they have told the rough seaman that such men as he made
history, and that theirs was the task in the present instance of
inscribing one of the brightest pages in the chronicles of
centuries. Can the momentous drama now being acted in the New World be
so travestied? Can an intelligent people be duped by such mockeries
and not perceive their shallowness? The system of raising a golden
calf one day and falling prostrate in blind worship before it, then
breaking it to pieces the next because the prayers offered have not
been answered, is very much the fashion here just now. First we see
the veteran Scott removed from the high pinnacle beneath which
thousands chanted their hymns of praise. Numerous minor idols of
popular or political belief follow in his wake, while only latterly
Fremont the chosen has been summarily dismissed from his command to
make way for a successor whose career may be more short-lived
still. And, if the signs of the times may be accepted as an omen, "the
coming man, the modern Alexander, the young Napoleon," as journalists
have delighted to term M'Clellan, with oceans of other adulatory
titles&#x2014;he, too, has nearly run his course. Already strong parties are
sapping at the foundations of the pedestal on which he stands, and a
bitingly-sarcastic pamphlet has appeared bitterly attacking him for
his want of energy and the sluggishness of his movements. How long,
let me ask, will Captain Wilkes maintain his position in the niche
which he at present occupies in the Walhalla of Northern heroes? Well,
in the discussions that have been created by this all-absorbing topic
of Slidell and Mason, much has been elicited that is antagonistic to
England; and I, who have been a strong partisan of the North, lament
that it should be so. The arrogance and selfishness of those whose
cause in my Liliputian manner I had espoused has been portrayed as I
never saw it before, and I feel I have only been doing my duty in
expressing myself as strongly as I have.</p>
<p>With regard to the conduct of the war I can say but little; matters
on the Potomac remain nearly in statu quo, The vast accumulation
of troops, much better drilled and disciplined then they were, are
lying idle within their lines, though it is impossible to say whether
they will go into winter quarters where they are or advance. With the
exception of a few reconnaissances, no movement whatever has taken
place, and this torpid condition of matters is raising a great outcry
throughout the North; the capitalists who have been furnishing
Government with funds expressing loudest of all their discontent. It
appears to me that the plan of the Cabinet is to operate on the
Southern seaboard by means of naval expeditions, and I suspect they
hope to draw off from the centre the troops of the Carolinas,
Louisiana, &amp;c., for the protection of their various States. The
success of such strategy would have the effect of weakening the
Confederate forces at Centreville and Manassas, where it is reported
they have an army of over 70,000 men, strongly intrenched, and
perhaps enable M'Clellan to make a dash towards Richmond. However this
may be, I am getting tired of this continual "Wait another week and
you will see something done,<sic>'</sic> which I am constantly being told by
officers high in command. At present I am almost at a standstill for
subjects for illustration, and I shall have shortly, in case of
nothing transpiring here, to look around me seriously for another
field. The only persons who appear to me to display any amount of
activity are the greedy hordes of hungry contractors, who are
determined to have their pound of flesh from the sorely-pressed
Union. They flock here in myriads, and it was only last evening that I
had pointed out to me a gentleman with a gracefully-curved proboscis
who, by a lucky stroke of "Pishness, my tears," had succeeded in
bagging a hundred thousand dollars of the public money.</p>

<p rend="center">THE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF 
GREAT BRITAIN AND THE UNITED STATES, FROM 
THE TREATY OF GHENT UNTIL THE INAUGURATION OF 
PRESIDENT LINCOLN.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is necessary to preface the following
catalogue of the principal international questions which engaged the
attention of the Governments of Great Britain and the United States
from 1814 to 1861 by observing that the object of the editor is not
the base one of further inflaming the public mind against the United
States' Government and people, but the simple and legitimate one of
affording desirable and seasonable information to the readers of this
Journal. In order, further, to guard against the possibility of
misconstruction, we beg to draw attention to three facts&#x2014;first, that
the seceded States are equally responsible with the loyal States for
the past policy of the United States, be it good or evil; secondly,
that the present Administration and Congress of the United States are
substantially revolutionised organisations which ought not in equity
to be held too strictly accountable for the misdeeds of a past with
which they do not, in many respects, desire to be identified; and,
thirdly, that the great mass of the party now in power in the United
States consists of those, or the sons of those, who in former times
have loyally striven to preserve peace between the two countries, and
without whose co-operation that peace could never have been so long
preserved unbroken. If, on the present occasion, the conduct of the
Republican Administration and Senate on this their first trial only
rises to a level with the maxims of the extinct Federalist and Whig
parties, whose political heirs they are, there is no danger of the
affair of the Trent being allowed to drift into the last extremity of
war.</p>
<p> In 1817 General Jackson, of Tennessee, warring against the
Seminole Indians in Georgia and Alabama, marched into Florida, then a
Spanish possession, without declaring war, seized two Indian traders
named Arbuthnot, a Scotchman, and Ambrister, an Englishman, whom he
accused of inciting the Indians to hostilities, and tried them by a
court-martial, which sentenced the former to imprisonment, the latter
to death. General Jackson took upon himself the responsibility of
executing both. The Marquis of Lansdown, at the opening of the Session
in 1819, brought the subject before the House of Lords, and
stigmatised the act as "one of those naked acts of violence which
disgraced those by whom it was committed." Lord Liverpool stated in
reply that the execution took place without the authority of the
American Government, and that the act was not such as necessitated a
demand for reparation, the refusal of which would necessarily bring on
a war between the two countries. The action of General Jackson in
overruling the milder sentence of the court-martial could not, he
said, be spoken of without horror. No more notice was taken of the
event in Parliament; but the Opposition party in Congress loudly
condemned the conduct of General Jackson. It is a little singular that
this outrage, which is narrated in every school history in the United
States, where the unfortunate victims figure as "English emissaries,"
is not even alluded to either in our "Annual Register," "Knight's
Pictorial History of England," or Miss Martineau's "Thirty Years'
Peace."</p>
<p>In 1818 a commercial treaty was made between the two Governments.</p>
<p>In 1823 President Monroe and Mr. Canning co-operated in securing
the independence of the revolted Spanish American colonies. It was on
this occasion that the celebrated "Monroe doctrine," directed against
European interference on the American continent was first broached.</p>
<p>In 1837 the Canadian rebellion broke out and engendered a plentiful
crop of troubles. American "sympathisers" on the northern frontier,
after robbing the United States' Arsenal at Buffalo of its store of
arms, crossed the border and joined themselves to the rebels. A party
of them took possession of Navy Island, in the Niagara River, two
miles above the Falls, and within the jurisdiction of Canada. They
were supplied by a small steamer called the Caroline. One night a
party of Canadian militia, under the command of Sir Allan M'Nab,
crossed the river, cut the Caroline from her moorings in American
waters, set her afire, and let her float down the Falls. An American
citizen, named Durfee, shared the fate of the Caroline; and public
opinion in many quarters called on President Van Buren to declare war
against Great Britain; but wiser counsels prevailed. No reparation was
ever made for this act.</p>
<p>In 1840 this affair was the parent of another singular
complication. Alexander M'Leod, a loyal Irishman, while in a tavern at
Lockport, in the State of New York, made a foolish boast to the effect
that he was one of the party engaged in cutting out the Caroline. A
mob arrested him and threw him into gaol on the charge of aiding in
the murder of Durfee. The British Minister at Washington protested
against this act of the mob, declaring the operation to have been
effected in obedience to the colonial authorities, and therefore an
international question, for which an individual engaged therein as a
soldier was not liable. The British Government assumed the
responsibility of the destruction of the Caroline, and demanded the
release of the prisoner. The local magistrates were about to release
him on bail, but a mob overawed them. A committee of the Federal House
of Representatives demanded that the man should be held. As the
Federal Government would not prosecute, the State of New York stepped
in and tried M'Leod for an offence against one of her
citizens. Fortunately there was unquestionable evidence of an alibi,
and a verdict of acquittal was procured.</p>
<p>For many years the disputed question of the North-Eastern or Maine
boundary had been a chronic source of trouble between the two
countries. Fortunately for the cause of peace, the Whig party
triumphed in the Presidential election of 1840, and the Administration
of President Harrison immediately addressed itself to the task of
settling this formidable difficulty. On the British side Lord Aberdeen
was actuated by similar feelings, and Lord Ashburton was sent over to
the United States charged with this special mission. He and
Mr. Webster, the then Secretary of State, negotiated a treaty
(ratified in 1842) which settled the boundary line as it stands at
present. There were parties on both sides who were discontented with
this negotiation. Lord Palmerston stigmatised it as "the Ashburton
Capitulation." In reply to analogous attacks in the United States'
Senate, Mr. Webster produced a map with the boundary line marked in
the handwriting of George III, which proved he had made a good
bargain. His conduct in concealing this map from Lord Ashburton was
unfavourably commented on in England, though defended by the chiefs of
the Conservative party.</p>
<p>At the same time the treaty for the suppression of the African
slave trade was entered into. The "right of visit" was tacitly
allowed, and the Americans agreed to keep a squadron on the African
coast to guard against the abuse of the American flag.</p>
<p>The case of the Virginian brig Creole arose in October, 1841. While
this vessel was on its way from Norfolk to New Orleans, some slaves,
who formed part of the cargo, obtained possession of the ship, wounded
the captain and some of the crew, killed a passenger who owned some of
the slaves, <sic corr="and">aud</sic> carried the vessel into the British port of
Nassau, New Providence. Of the 123 slaves on board nineteen were
arrested, on the requisition of the American consul, on the charge of
mutiny and murder. The case against the negroes was pressed with zeal
by the Federal Government, but the law officers and law peers of Great
Britain were unanimous that there was no law by which the negroes
could be tried or detained. The nineteen prisoners were therefore set
free.</p>
<p>The Maine boundary question had hardly been settled when the Oregon
or North-Western boundary dispute acquired highly-dangerous
proportions. Even so early as 1822 Lord Castlereagh told the American
Minister in London that such was the condition of this question that
war could be kindled by holding up a finger. In 1818 an agreement had
been entered into opening the Oregon territory to the occupation of
settlers from both countries. On this footing things had remained
until 1844. The partisans of war sent out thither a numerous American
emigration, which greatly added to the difficulty of a peaceful
settlement. The American war party claimed the whole territory up to
54 deg. 40 min.; and in the Presidential election of 1844 Mr. Polk, who
was pledged to enforce this claim by war, if necessary, was elected in
preference to Mr. Clay, the Whig candidate, who favoured a
compromise. Mr. Polk's Message in December, 1845, was substantially a
war message; but, thanks to the moderation of the Senate, where the
Whig and Southern Democratic senators acted in alliance, a compromise
was agreed to settling the line to the Pacific at 49 deg., and giving
the island of Vancouver to Great Britain. President Polk, in assenting
to this arrangement in 1846, threw the responsibility upon the
Senate.</p>
<p>In 1850 the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty was made, about the true
construction of which a serious difference was to arise a few years
later.</p>
<p>In 1852 the Newfoundland fishery dispute broke out. Lord Derby's
Government sent instructions to the commanding Admiral to protect the
exclusive rights of the colonists within three marine miles of the
coasts of British North America, as provided for by the Treaty of
1818. The execution of these instructions caused great excitement in
the United States, which was increased by the inflammatory popular
speeches of Mr. Webster, then Secretary of State. American ships of
war were ordered to the spot and a collision was imminent.</p>
<p>The final settlement of this question was effected by the
Reciprocity Treaty of 1854, negotiated at Washington by Lord
Elgin. According to this arrangement the legislation affecting the
commerce between the United States and British America was altered in
a free-trade direction, the navigation of the St. Lawrence was opened
to American bottoms, and the exclusive right of shore-fishing was
abandoned.</p>
<p>In consequence of the filibustering expedition of Lopez against
Cuba, the Governments of Great Britain and France, in 1853, invited
the Government of the United States to enter into a tripartite treaty
to guarantee the possession of Cuba to the Spanish Crown. Mr. Everett,
then Secretary of State, refused to accede to the proposal.</p>
<p>In 1854 President Pierce, on some trifling pretext, ordered the
bombardment of Greytown, a city under the protection of Great
Britain. This act received the reprobation of the principal
Governments of the civilised world.</p>
<p>In 1856 the differences between Great Britain and the United States
on the Central American question came to a crisis. Under the
provisions of the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty the American Government
claimed that Great Britain was bound to surrender her possessions in
British Honduras, the Bay Islands, and the Mosquito Protectorate. Lord
Clarendon declined to accede to this interpretation, but offered to
abide by the award of a third party. To this the American Government
would not listen, and at the commencement of 1856 war seemed
imminent. Nevertheless, the American Government did not press its
requisitions to the point of war, and, after some fruitless attempts
to negotiate on a more moderate basis, this question has been settled
by the abandonment by Great Britain of the Mosquito Protectorate and
the Bay Islands, the former by treaty with the State of Nicaragua, the
latter by treaty with the State of Honduras.</p>
<p>In 1856 occurred the dismissal of the British Minister at
Washington (Mr. Crampton), on the false charge of having engaged in
the enlistment of soldiers for the British service on United States'
soil, Great Britain then being at war with Russia. On a similar charge
of breach of the neutrality laws three British Consuls had their
exequaturs withdrawn from them.</p>
<p>In the same year the resolutions of the Congress of Paris in
reference to maritime law were submitted to the United States'
Government for adoption. The Administration of President Pierce
refused to assent to that article which abolished privateering, unless
a clause were added exempting private property from seizure at sea. To
this proposal the Government of Lord Palmerston refused to assent, and
it was afterwards withdrawn by Mr. Buchanan, the successor of
Mr. Pierce.</p>
<p>In the same year the United States' Government purchased of the
salvors the derelict British barque Resolute, of the Arctic
Expedition, equipped and refitted her, and sent her back to England.</p>
<p>During Mr. Buchanan's term of office, with the close of which this
resum&#xE9; will terminate, but two points of difference arose. In
1858 the British Government, in the desire of stopping the slave trade
off the coast of Cuba, exercised "the right of visit" in the Gulf of
Mexico. This caused a unanimous burst of indignation from both the
great parties of the United States, and the practice was formally
abandoned by the British Government. All propositions for adopting
means by which the nationality of vessels suspected of being engaged
in the slave trade could be ascertained were rejected by the
Administration of Mr. Buchanan.</p>
<p>In the same year the Atlantic cable was laid, and messages of
mutual good will were exchanged between the Queen and the President
and the Mayors of London and New York.</p>
<p>In 1859 General Harney seized the island of St. Juan, the right to
which is claimed by both nations under the treaty relating to the
North-western boundary. This act of General Harney, being contrary to
an express understanding between the two Governments that neither
party should occupy the island until the right of possession had been
determined, led to a remonstrance by the British Government. General
Scott was sent to the Pacific coast to overrule General Harney. The
affair terminated in the joint occupancy of the island, and in the
recall of the offending General.</p>
<p>In 1860, on the invitation of President Buchanan, the Prince of
Wales made a tour through the Northern and Western States. The
incidents of this memorable tour are still so fresh in the public mind
that it is unnecessary to dwell upon them. It will be a terrible irony
on the civilisation of the age, a standing reproach against human
nature, if this visit of reconciliation&#x2014; which seemed to be a fitting
finale to a bitter and long-standing international feud&#x2014;should, after
all, be nothing but a mocking prelude to a third war with the United
States&#x2014;war so often imminent, yet, as we have seen, as often
avoided.</p>

<p rend="center">SCIENTIFIC NEWS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumatic Pile-Bridge</hi>&#x2014;Mr. C. C. Martin, the American engineer
who completed the Brooklyn Waterworks, carried on the erection of a
bridge across the Savannah River until interrupted by the civil
war. This bridge is on the line of the Charleston and Savannah
Railroad, about sixteen miles from the latter city. When completed, it
will consist of six fixed spans and a swing-bridge, with an aggregate
length of 900 feet. The two abutments and seven piers are to consist
of pneumatic piles&#x2014;the abutments and four piers to be of two piles
each, the piers at the end of the swing-bridge to consist of four
cylinders each, and the pivot-pier of five. The cylinders are cast in
sections, nine feet in length and six feet outside diameter, with two
inches of metal. The apparatus for sinking these piles consists of a
large flat boat, upon which is placed a 16-horse power steam-engine,
and two double-acting air-pumps, hoisting apparatus, &amp;c. In the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Franklin Institute</hi>, Philadelphia,
appears an interesting account of the process of sinking the
cylinders, with illustrative woodcuts. Two portions of cylinder are
made airtight by whitelead, and held in proper position by "guys,"
&amp;c. The pumps are set in action, and the cylinder sinks into the sand
(about six feet in three minutes) on the application of a vacuum. As
the process proceeds, a syphon pipe and other apparatus are
employed. When at last a stopcock is opened, and the compressed air is
allowed to escape suddenly, the upward pressure from within is removed
and the cylinder, by its own weight, forces itself deeply into the
sand. The amount of sand which enters the cylinder under the bottom
when the pressure is allowed to escape is astonishing. When a cylinder
sank less then a foot the sand rose inside it twenty-two feet (equal
to twenty-one cubic yards), which was brought in by the rushing water
in a few minutes. On one occasion, when the men were at work in a
cylinder, they suddenly heard a sound like the report of a cannon, and
all became as dark as night. The report was occasioned by the sudden
removal of the pressure from without, while within the air was
condensed. The darkness was occasioned by the rapid condensation of
the vapour held in invisible suspension in the condensed air, forming
a thick fog.</p>

<p rend="center">PROSPECTS OF THE YEAR.</p>
<p>...Although we believe that there was scarcely an Englishman whose
first and warmest feeling was not a determination to hold to the
honour of his country and the vindication of international rights, yet
it can hardly be supposed that any one amongst us was blind to the
sacrifices and the inevitable consequences which must follow a hostile
venture of any kind who did not recognise the truth of the saying that
peace is the happy, natural state of man, and that it were better that
she should be allowed still to go on achieving those victories which
are no less renowned than those of war. In short, the point on which
the fortunes, the events, and the happiness, more or less, of the new
year turned was our relations with the Federal States of America.</p>
<p>If to a certain extent we are still held in suspense in that
respect, there is now much, very much, to encourage the hope of a
pacific solution of a difficulty, the extent and importance of which
we in this country at least have never underrated. In the first
instance, as we all know, the matter in dispute did not strike on the
American mind with any sense of that real magnitude which has since
been somewhat more acknowledged. The palpable change in the feeling,
as we believe, which has come over the bulk of those whose influence
on the action of the Federal Government could probably not be
overrated seems to be the most natural thing in the world. The mind of
England was expressed with a unanimity, a directness, and a thorough
apprehension of the gravity of the question; the course of her
Majesty's Ministers was prompt, the deliberations of a single Cabinet
Council resulting in a special address to the Government of
Washington, the substance of which it was evident must be in
accordance with the voice of public opinion; and at once, and with an
activity which spoke well for the condition of our administrative
departments, preparations were made for any eventuality. The process
of reasoning amongst the Americans must have received its first
impulse from these facts; at least the notion that what had occurred
was a small matter involving no serious consequences must have been at
once disabused. Reaction, arising, not from anything which could be
construed into timidity, but from an appreciation of<pb n="34"/> the
importance of the issue, may reasonably be supposed to have even then
commenced in the States. But when it was ascertained that first and
foremost France, then Prussia, then Austria, and, as it is said, even
Russia, spontaneously expressed opinions that, on principles of
international law, the affair of the Trent cannot be justified, it was
hardly to be conceived that a nation which the leading Powers of the
civilised world in combination declare to be in the wrong could
persist in backing up its error even at the cost of a war, which to
call disastrous would be employing a very feeble phrase indeed. There
never was a [better] situation in which a great people could afford to act
gracefully and to bend, with no loss of honour, before an acknowledged
law of society. It seems to us that it would have been mere frenzy in
the Americans to stick to a quarrel which, in universal international
opinion, is deficient in that element of justice which, did it exist,
would thrice arm those who espouse it. To the petulant outbreaks on
this question of the professors of "bunkum" which some of the latest
accounts tell us have not been wanting, even in the comparatively
sedate discussions of the Senate, we attached little weight, for we
believed they were no longer in accordance with the feeling of the
American people at large; and, if the matter in dispute has been
settled with less graciousness than might be desired, it will be owing
to some such ruder spirits as those who have recently made
uncompromising motions in Congress with a want of success which is in
itself not a little significant.</p>
<p>Happily we are able to say that the first great cause which must
have influenced the destinies of the twelve months into which we have
just entered has been removed; that there will be no war...</p>
<p>As we set out, so we conclude, that, when we looked forward to the
new year, much, if not all, of its happiness depended on the news we
were awaiting from our kindred in the West. Now that we know that
there is to be peace between us, we do not reflect with anything but
satisfaction on the course which this country adopted, and we think
with equal pleasure on the course which has been adopted by the
American Government.</p>

AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> the arrival of the Jura we have news
from New York to the 28th ult. The City of Washington's advices had
previously relieved us of our painful suspense as to the issue of
peace or war.</p>

<p rend="center">SURRENDER OF MESSRS MASON AND SLIDELL.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons received his despatches early on the 19th ult., and had
several unofficial interviews with Mr. Seward, at which the demands of
the British Government were made known to the American Secretary, but
not formally delivered. Mr. Seward met Lord Lyons in a friendly
manner, but entered into no conversation with him on the points
involved. It was not till the 23rd that Lord Lyons formally presented
the demands of the British Government to Mr. Seward, who received a
copy of Earl Russell's despatch.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons informed Mr. Seward that he would wait till the 30th for
a reply.</p>
<p>On the 25th M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington,
presented M. Thouvenel's letter to Mr. Seward, and on the 27th, three
days before the expiration of the term granted by Lord Lyons,
Mr. Seward conceded the demands made by Earl Russell.</p>
<p>After coming to this resolution the American Administration
immediately published the correspondence, in order, probably, to
justify its course in the eyes of Congress and public opinion. The
Jura brings the following summary thereof:&#x2014;</p>
<p>The correspondence commences with a despatch from Mr. Seward to
Mr. Adams in London, declaring that Captain Wilks acted without
instructions, and hoping that the British Government would consider
the subject in a friendly temper. Mr. Seward says also that the
British Government may expect the best disposition on the part of the
Federal Government.</p>
<p>The next despatch is from Earl Russell to Lord Lyons, stating the
outrage on the British flag, and hoping that the act was committed
without instructions from the Federal Government, as that Government
must be aware that Great Britain cannot allow such an affront to pass
without reparation. Earl Russell expresses a hope that the Federal
Government will offer suitable redress by giving up the four prisoners
to Lord Lyons.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward replied that the English Government rightly conjectured
that the act was without the authority or knowledge of the Federal
Government. He trusts that England will see that the Federal
Government neither practised nor approved any deliberate wrong in the
transaction, and declares that Great Britain has a right to demand the
same reparation as the United States would expect from any friendly
nation in a similar case. Mr. Seward says he is aware that he argues
on the British side of the case; but in doing so he is only defending
American principles. He quotes the instructions from Mr. Madison,
Secretary of State in 1804, to Mr. Monroe, Minister to England, and
says, "If I decide this case in favour of my own Government I must
disallow its most cherished principles and for ever abandon its most
cherished policy; but the country cannot afford such a sacrifice. The
Government cannot deny the justice of England's claim." Mr. Seward, in
conclusion, states that the four prisoners are at the disposal of Lord
Lyons, and asks his Lordship to indicate a time and place for
receiving them.</p>
<p>Lord Lyons, in his reply, says he will forward Mr. Seward's
communication to the British Government, and will confer personally
with him in regard to the reception of the four gentlemen.</p>
<p>The note from M. Thouvenel to the French Minister on the Trent
affair is included in the correspondence.</p>
<p>On the 24th it was said on good authority that thus far only the
President and Secretary Seward had handled the question on the
American side, the last regular Cabinet meeting having been adjourned
by a note from Mr. Lincoln, to avoid the risk of a general and
premature discussion.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEBATE IN THE SENATE.</p>
<p>On the 26th Mr. Hale, a Republican Senator from New Hampshire,
demanded the correspondence with England on the Trent
question. Mr. Sumner, of Massachusetts, the chairman of the Committee
of Foreign Affairs, objected to this demand.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale stated that he had heard the Cabinet were considering the
proposition to surrender Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said also he
would favour foreign arbitration; but, if England had demanded the
surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, the Federal Government should
declare War against England. "If they were surrendered, the Senate,"
said Mr. Hale, "would be subject to the scorn and indignation of the
country, and the Administration would be hurled from power." Mr. Hale
believed that Napoleon would desire to wipe out the stain of Waterloo,
and that thousands of Irishmen in Canada would join the Federal
cause. Mr. Hale concluded a violent speech against England by urging
war sooner then the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell.</p>
<p>Mr. Sumner urged that the consideration of the question should be
delayed until it was presented in a practical form. He denied that
there was proof of arrogant demands on the part of England, or that
the Administration had not considered the question of arbitration, and
stated his belief that the matter would be honourably and amicably
adjusted.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale's motion was tabled for future discussion.</p>
<p>On the 23rd the House of Representatives adjourn until the 2nd
instant.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEELING AMONG THE COMMERCIAL CLASSES.</p>
<p>The trade circular of Messrs. Neill Brothers forcibly describes the
transition of sentiment among this class:&#x2014;</p>
<p>The first emotion when the news of that event became public in this
country was a mingled one of surprise and delight with the boldness
and neatness of the exploit and at finding such important enemies in Northern
custody, and of fear that the act was illegal and impossible to
maintain. Even the President himself admitted that the prisoners would
probably have to be given up. But forthwith the press of this country,
whose main policy is to charm their readers and increase their own
popularity by telling the public whatever they will like to hear,
devoted themselves heart and soul to the work of convincing themselves
and their readers that the act was perfectly legal, in accordance with
precedent, and especially with English decisions. It is easy to
convince those who wish to believe; and as all the argument was on one
side, with none to expose its fallacies, sophistries, and
misrepresentations, it is not surprising that the mass of the people
should have been speedily satisfied; and, being convinced as to the
legality of the act, neither was it surprising that among a people so
self-confident as to their power of judging correctly and so vain of
their military strength, a unanimous determination should be arrived
at and expressed not, under any circumstances, to part with the
prisoners. The mob desired to hold them, right or wrong; the more
respectable citizens determined to hold them because they had already
been so easily convinced it was right. . . . .Thus for a few days war
between Great Britain and the Northern States seemed almost
inevitable. But we are happy to be able to inform you that during the
past three days there has been a most salutary and extraordinary
change in public sentiment here and<pb n="35"/> throughout the
country. It was to a great extent a game of brag, after all, and none
the less so that the people had deceived themselves quite as much, if
not more, than they deceived others..... Whereas, a week ago, nine out
of every ten men would tell you that England might threaten as she
pleased, but the prisoners would never be given up, now the balance of
opinion is quite the other way.....Upon a deliberate review of the
delicate, and apparently extremely hazardous, relations of this
country with Great Britain, we are inclined to believe war between the
two nations now more distant than we thought it before the present
complication arose. The American Government had for some time past
acted upon a presumption that England's interests in the preservation
of peace with them were so great that she would bear any number of
petty indignities rather than make them a cause of war. This idea will
now probably be modified, and there may be a little more of that
respect shown to British subjects which they are accustomed to receive
in other foreign countries, and fewer arrests of them without process
of law or opportunities <sic corr="for">fir</sic> their justification or defence.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEELING OF THE PEOPLE.</p>
<p>The popular feeling in intensely hostile to England. Even those
journalists and others who urge the necessity of yielding in the
present instance do so, avowedly, from motives of expediency,
recording a vow meanwhile that henceforth England's difficulty shall
be America's opportunity. No passion less strong than that for
restoring the Union would, they say, allow them to consent to the
surrender of the captives. It is freely charged that the British
nation, in its desire for cotton and to dismember the Union, is only
seeking a pretext for a quarrel, and that they have taken advantage of
the momentary weakness of the United States to humiliate the latter to
the dust. It must be observed, however, that these lively expressions
of resentment were uttered before the despatches from the Continental
European Governments had been published.</p>

<p rend="center">A NEW DIFFICULTY.</p>
<p>The telegraph reports a new outrage on the British flag, apparently
similar to that of Commander Wilks. The Federal steamer Santiago de
Cuba overhauled, on the coast of Texas, the schooner Eugenia Smith,
sailing under the British flag. She found nothing contraband on board,
but took from her deck two passengers, who, from the papers found upon
them, were supposed to be agents of the Confederate States. These
passengers, Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, had arrived at New York, and
been confined in Fort Lafayette. The telegram says that the schooner
was sailing between Matanzas and Havannah, two Cuban ports; but for
Matanzas, Metamoras, a Mexican port, should probably be read.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TREATY WITH MEXICO.</p>
<p>A treaty between the United States and Mexico is reported to have
been submitted to Congress, by which the Federal Government agrees to
pay Mexico 11,000,000 dols. to refund the British and French
claims. Mexico is to grant the United States commercial privileges and
permission to transport across the Mexican territory.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>The harbour of Charleston has been destroyed, sixteen whaling hulks
filled with granite, having been sunk in three parallel lines
equidistant across the channel. The flow permitted to the water will
prevent the cutting of a new outlet, and the obstruction will soon
accumulate a triple line of sandbanks across the entrance.</p>
<p>A force of 1300 Confederates have surrendered themselves to the
Federal forces on Missouri, with their baggage and equipments.</p>
<p>There has also been a slight engagement at Drainsville, near
Leesburg, in Virginia, in which the Confederates, being overnumbered,
were forced to retire.</p>
<p>From Beaufort, South Carolina, the Federal forces have dispatched
to New York a cargo of 120,000lb. of sea-island cotton, gathered by
the refugee negroes, and there were 400,000lb. more ready for shipment
by the next vessel.</p>

<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>
<p>Congress has raised the duty on tea to 20 cents per pound, on
coffee to 5 cents per pound; on sugar, 2 1-3, 3, 5, and 8 cents per
pound, according to quality, and on molasses to 6 cents per
gallon. These measures were in accordance with Mr. Chase's
recommendation. These duties came into force immediately, and apply to
all goods in warehouse.</p>
<p>Congress has appropriated 1,500,000 dollars for gun-boats on the
western lakes, and 1,200,000 dollars for the establishment of a naval
d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The New York banks have lost five million dollars in specie in a
fortnight, and the Sub-Treasury four millions; yet only about half a
million has left the country, although the rate of exchange gives a
profit on the export of specie to England. It is evident, therefore,
that hoarding has begun. Under those circumstances a suspension of
cash payments is considered to be imminent.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Abolitionist leader of Boston, had
delivered an address in favour of emancipation and against the
"reconstruction" of the Union, in the Cooper Institute, New York, to a
crowded audience, consisting of the &#xE9;lite of the city.</p>
<p>At the annual dinner of the New England Society to commemorate the
landing of the Pilgrim Fathers, a letter from Mr. Seward was read,
dated Dec. 11, of which the following is the material portion:&#x2014;</p>
<p>Dear Sir,&#x2014;Pray present my apology to the sons of New England for
declining their invitation to the New England dinner. My duties here
allow me little enjoyment of the holidays. If it were an Old England
dinner instead of a New England feast I would certainly strain a point
to attend. I would like so good an opportunity to attempt to show to
our cousins across the seas that there is no material benefit or moral
influence that can accrue to us that will not also increase the
prosperity and greatness of Great Britain, and that every disaster
that befalls the United States is also pregnant with suffering and
sorrow sooner or later to be borne by Great Britain.</p>

<p rend="center">LATEST NEWS FROM ABROAD</p>
<p>The following telegrams were received at Mr. Reuters office
yesterday (Friday):&#x2014;</p>
<p>...Thomas D'Arcy M'Gee, in a letter just published, declining to speak
at a festival of the New England Society, at Montreal, writes as
follows:&#x2014;</p>
<p>"I declare most absolutely, and it is well that the opponents of
Canada should know in time, that the Irish inhabitants of this colony
will be found embattled as one man in defence of the Canadian
Constitution and the Imperial connection. There is hardly a group of
Irish settlers in Upper or Lower Canada that I have not personally
visited during the last four or five years. There is not a man of note
amongst them, layman or cleric, that I have not met: and I declare
that I have yet to meet the first man of all those bodies and orders
of men who does not frankly and loyally prefer our Canadian
Institutions to those of the United States. Formerly, I believe, it
was different with many among them (as I own it was some years ago
with myself); but since the era of 'the knownothing' movement the last
vestige of political preference for the United States has disappeared
among the Irish here."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Arrival of a Federal War-Steamer at Southampton.</hi>&#x2014;</p>
<p>A correspondent writes from Southampton on Wednesday evening as
follows:&#x2014;"The Tuscarora, one of the new screw-corvettes built for the
Federal Navy, arrived in the river this afternoon, about half-past
three o'clock, from New York. She left that port on the 15th ult., and
had a very rough passage across the Atlantic, and put into Fayal for
coals, sailing thence eight days since. From Fayal she has had fine
weather. The Tuscarora is commanded by Captain T. Augustus Craven, and
her officers and crew number about 200 in all. She mounts nine heavy
guns, two of them the famous 11-inch columbiads (both on pivots), six
broadside guns, and a rifled Parrot gun on the forecastle. The
corvette is a smart-looking vessel, of 1200 tons burden, and barque
rigged. She is just built, and only arrived at New York from
Philadelphia on the 9th ult. It is understood that her mission in
these waters is specially to look after the Nashville, and generally
to protect the interests of Federal shipping. The Nashville remains in
dock, and her future movements are, of course, kept profoundly
secret. She is coaled and ready for sea; and it was rumoured this
morning that she was going out of dock during the day into the river;
but up to this time (five p.m.) she is lying quietly in her
berth. Whether she will now keep her quarters a close prisoner, keenly
watched by the Tuscarora, until the conflict is over, or whether, on
some favourable opportunity, she will venture to 'run the blockade'
and escape, time only can determine."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 11,
1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> dove has come and not the eagle. On
Wednesday evening a telegram from Lord Lyons was brought by the City
of Washington mail-steamer announcing that the act of Captain Wilks
was annulled by the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their
two secretaries. The relations between England and the Northern States
are, therefore, placed upon their former footing.</p>
<p>That Mr. Lincoln has performed this act of justice is
sufficient. In what way it has been done, what the document with which
Mr. Seward has accompanied the notification to Lord Lyons may be, what
the American journals may say, what indignation may be expressed by
mob meetings&#x2014;are all considerations which may be set apart from the
main point. A Government has had the wisdom to do justice and to
repudiate, by deed if not by word, an outrage upon the flag of another
Government. It may be that the right thing has been done in the wrong
manner, and that there may be little cause for sentimental outbreak
upon the subject. But right has been done, and the horrors of war have
been averted; and in this there is surely enough to prompt the myriads
who will assemble to-morrow in the House of Prayer to offer grateful
thanksgivings to Him who " heareth and answereth prayer."</p>
<p>It would, at the same time, be an absurd affectation to pretend any
doubt as to the human means that have wrought this most desirable
issue. England has made at once an unmistakable manifestation of
feeling and a magnificent demonstration of power, and public opinion
and wise statesmanship have acted in unison. It was made clear to the
American Government that we should enforce our rights, and the
President has had the prudence to risk unpopularity for the hour
instead of encountering defeat and disgrace for his country. We do not
see that it is either necessary or generous to examine too closely the
reasons which he may offer to the excited people of America. If he
chooses to tell them that they are engaged in what has, up to the
present time, been an unsuccessful war, which is costing them a
million and a quarter of dollars every day, and that for the sake of
detaining four gentlemen in a State prison it was not worth while to
engage in a new contest, in which the overwhelming force of the most
powerful nation in the world, supported by the opinion of Europe,
would instantly be brought to bear upon the North, we have no right to
complain that he should take that line, instead of boldly declaring
that he unhesitatingly reversed a wrong. Mr. Seward's State paper, be
it what it may, has been framed rather for his own countrymen than for
England, and will in due course be answered, no doubt, by the terse
dialectics of the Foreign Office. Some of the journals will, of
course, be venomous, and will threaten us with signal chastisement
when the empire of the North shall be re-established and the South,
trampled, shall be unable to interfere. For this, and for the Greek
Kalends, we will wait patiently. The single point on which it is
possible that the good-hearted John Bull may feel he would like to
reply is the allegation that he made his demand "in the hour of
America's disasters and distress." This is altogether a bran-new
statement of the case. Six weeks ago we were solemnly and vauntfully
assured that America was exceedingly rich and powerful, and had nearly
three-quarters of a million of soldiers ready for anything. The South
was to be repressed the moment General M'Clellan should be ready to
move, and then the army of the North could move upon Canada, or
Ireland, or Yorkshire, if necessary. Therefore we had no right to know
anything about distress or disaster, and might consider ourselves as
doing a bold thing in asking the flushed and fiery champions of the
Union to surrender their prey. But, even supposing that the North were
unfavourably circumstanced, it could not justify her in doing a wrong
or us in submitting to one. It is not because a man is irritated and
upon bad terms with his wife and family that he is to be allowed to
rush into another man's house and carry off his property. We have,
however, made the demand for reparation in the most considerate way,
have done everything to conciliate, and, by means of a graceful and
informal piece of diplomacy, we left it open to Mr. Lincoln to seize
the opportunity of making an unenforced atonement for a pirate's
action. We are therefore clear of all blame in the whole transaction,
and legally, morally, and even sentimentally, we have shown ourselves
friends to the Americans. When the storm shall have gone down this
will be admitted by all except the viler of the journals. It is said
that a man whose position may, at no distant date, be a far higher one
than is now supposed&#x2014;the Commander of the American Army&#x2014;has already
declared that England has acted rightly.</p>
<p>We must now wait details, but we wait in a far different attitude
from that in which we were to be found until Wednesday. We welcome the
dove, and Britannia throws down the lanyard, rejoiced that she is
spared the pain of a straggle with those for whom, despite all their
unkindness, she ever retains a warmer sympathy than she can feel for
any other nation in the world.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the Illustrations of the civil war
in America which, by means of our Special Artist in the Federal camp
on the Potomac, we have been enabled to give in this Journal, some
have been devoted to showing the queer punishments to which the
rowdies of the camp are subjected; and our Number for the 28th of
December last contained an Engraving of the drumming a loafing scamp
out of the Federal army. These, however, are common incidents in camp
life. The provost-marshal of the Alexandrian division has had to carry
out a severer sentence. On Dec. 13 a private in the Lincoln Cavalry,
named Johnson, was executed at Fairfax Seminary, near Washington, for
desertion. The execution took place before a large body of troops. As
the procession passed along, the doomed man was seated in a waggon,
and by his side was a Roman Catholic priest, who was giving to him the
last ministration of religion. He held open a prayer-book before the
prisoner, who, with his head bowed down, was attentively reciting a
prayer. When he had arrived at the place of execution he alighted from
the waggon and seated himself on the coffin. Twelve men, detailed to
execute the sentence, took their position about six paces in front. He
addressed a few words to them, stating that as fellow-soldiers he
hoped they would forgive him for having committed the offence he had,
and that they would not do as he had done. A few parting words were
given to his spiritual adviser and three or four officers, after which
he prepared himself to have the sentence executed. He was seated on
his coffin when the word was given to fire. Eight balls pierced
various parts of his body, but as he only showed a slight tremor the
reserve was ordered to fire, and four other shots were fired, one of
which entered his eye, and another his mouth, and he fell
dead.</p></div2>

<p>The privateer Sumter, after being, as was thought, sighted off
Ramsgate, has turned up at Cadiz, where, with the officers and
crews&#x2014;forty-two persons in all&#x2014;of three Federal merchant-vessels which
she had destroyed at sea, she solicited permission to enter the
port. The American Consul demanded that this request should be
refused, but, the Government having been consulted, the Sumter was
admitted into the port without being saluted.</p></div2>

<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips delivered a speech in New York on the 19th
ult. in favour of the immediate abolition of slavery. Cooper's
Institute was crowded, and his audience included a large number of the
elite of the city. His radical anti-slavery sentiments evoked
unbounded enthusiasm.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PAST DANGER AND PRESENT DUTY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">To</hi> our inexpressible relief and gratification we were able to
announce in our last Number that the Government at Washington had
definitively acquiesced in the claim made upon them by the British
Government for the restoration of the persons taken from on board the
Trent by the Captain of the San Jacinto to the protection of the flag
beneath which they were illegally seized. A calm review of the facts
of the case, an attentive and dispassionate perusal of the diplomatic
correspondence, and a fresh survey of the fearful calamity from which
this decision has rescued both countries, have increased rather than
lessened our thankfulness for this peaceful issue of the difference
which three weeks ago looked so threatening. Both the countries
concerned have reason to rejoice, for, in the event of war, no matter
which of the two may have been the victor, it could have become so
only by passing over the mangled remains of its own most cherished
policy.</p> 
<p>Besides the usual and inevitable evils inseparable from a hostile
collision between two great Powers&#x2014;the waste of blood and treasure,
the interruption of trade, and the demoralisation of the people on
both sides&#x2014;war with the Federal States of America would have forced
upon Great Britain an immediate, and perhaps a permanent, sacrifice of
one of her foremost national purposes&#x2014;namely, the extinction of the
slave trade and the discouragement of slavery all the world
over. Whatever may have been the grounds upon which the States of the
North have come into conflict with those of the South&#x2014;whatever may be
the professed object for which they are carrying it on, at such
immense cost to themselves, and hitherto with so little apparent
success&#x2014;at whatever time and in whatever way it may be ultimately
decided&#x2014;one thing is certain, that as slavery was the remote cause of
the quarrel between North and South, so, but for foreign intervention,
slavery will be weakened, and in the end destroyed, by the prosecution
of the struggle. Quite apart from the will of either of the
belligerents, this seems to be one of the unavoidable consequences of
the present civil war&#x2014;the only one, we may add, which the people of
England have contemplated with anything approaching to a feeling of
satisfaction. A war with the Federal<pb n="58"/> States would
instantly have coerced us into unwelcome but not the less mischievous
complicity with the bitterest opponents of that policy with which,
more than any other nation upon the face of the earth, we have
identified the name and fame of England, for which we have made the
largest sacrifices and braved the ill-will of other maritime Powers,
and the final success of which seemed even to the most moderate
expectation to be very close at hand. England, allied with a
confederation of slaveholding States, the corner-stone of whose
constitution is not merely the lawfulness but the expediency of
slavery, and the thinly-veiled object of whose policy is the wide
extension of slave territory and the speedy revival of the slave
trade&#x2014;England, recognising such a confederation, and thereby imparting
to it a vitality and strength which it neither possesses nor deserves,
and assisting it to make good its position against the Free States of
the North, from which, for the sake of perpetuating and extending
slavery, it wantonly seceded;&#x2014;such a position as this would have been
for our country a cruel necessity, entailing upon it a humiliation,
and exhibiting to the world a scandal, for which no military nor naval
success could have been accepted as adequate compensation. Thank God,
we have escaped the danger.</p> 
<p>And yet, with this miserable contingency before their eyes, we do
not see how the British Government could safely or honourably have
declined to front it, nor how they could have met the embarrassment in
which it placed them more wisely or with more dignity than they have
done. As soon as the facts relating to the capture of Messrs. Mason
and Slidell on board the Trent steamer had been laid before them, they
were calmly referred to the law officers of the Crown for judicial
investigation as to the bearing in which they stood to the law of
nations; and, on the report of those responsible officers that the
Captain of the San Jacinto had taken upon himself to execute judgment
on his individual, and of course unrecognised, authority, without
appealing to the decision of a Prize Court, and had thereby offered an
affront to our flag, Earl Russell immediately forwarded to Lord
Lyons, our Minister at Washington, a despatch, couched in the most
courteous terms, assuming that the act of aggression could not have
been committed with the authority or approbation of the Federal
Government, and intimating that the only reparation which this country
could accept would be a restoration of the captured gentlemen to the
protection of the British flag. Confident as her Majesty's Ministers
may have been in the expectation that Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward would
see not only the justice but the policy of admitting this claim, it
behoved them in common prudence to make instant and effectual
preparation for the disagreeable alternative. Winter was setting
in. Canada, in the event of war, would lie exposed to the first
hostile blow from the Federal States. She was wholly unprepared. The
quarrel was not hers. England was bound to place her, if possible, in
a position of security before the rigour of the climate should
preclude all access to her along her own coasts. Hence the despatch to
Washington was immediately followed by the dispatch of troops to
Quebec and Halifax. All available means were taken to strengthen the
fleet. In short, while earnestly desiring peace, and shaping their
course so as to facilitate to the utmost its preservation, the British
Government exhibited the greatest promptitude, activity, and
forethought in making ready for war. In both respects, we believe,
they secured the approbation of the country.</p> 
<p>Mr. Seward's despatch to Lord Lyons has happily averted the dreaded
rupture of amicable relations between the two peoples. He has
justified our claim&#x2014;he has surrendered the prisoners. Let us accept
with generosity what has been conceded with a show of
cheerfulness. His able despatch might, under other circumstances,
provoke criticism. Its conclusion should disarm any such desire. A
mutual analysis of national motives would do neither nation the least
good, and would probably exhibit neither to unmixed advantage. On both
sides irritating questions might be asked which it would be difficult
to answer in any way that would not exasperate. We have asked the
Federal Union to do us right, and they have done it, openly admitting
that what we asked was justifiable and reasonable. Between individual
gentlemen such a course is held to bury the offence out of sight, and
the propriety of the rule is equally recognised by nations. We should
be sorry, therefore, to demean ourselves by raking among the ashes of
the past for matter of offensive comment, or food for
self-complacency. There is in any such attempt a revolting malignancy
and pettiness of spirit which true and magnanimous Englishmen will
scorn to countenance. Reparation having been made, bygones become
bygones. The wretch who shakes hands over his antagonist's apology and
concession, and thereupon begins to reopen his complaint, displays
himself as a pitiable example of impotency in the government of his
own passions. If the <hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi> fails to
satisfy him, he is justly believed to be nursing a wicked design
beneath a pretended regard for the unsullied purity of his name. Great
Britain, we are certain, will not be guilty of that unspeakable
meanness. What has been frankly yielded, even though more tardily than
she could have wished, will be as frankly received. Why it was not
offered before she will forbear to inquire; and no one better then she
knows, and none more fully than she can appreciate, the difficulty of
at once closing the ears and the heart against the whispered
insinuations of national pride. The last American war was occasioned
by our failing to determine in time what we resolved, when too late,
to surrender. We have reason to be thankful that Mr. Lincoln did not
delay his decision beyond the limit allowed him for deliberation.</p>
<p>We may extract if we will from the anxious experience through which
we have just passed two or three lessons that may be of service to the
world generally as well as to ourselves in particular. We have already
recorded our emphatic approbation of the steps taken by her Majesty's
Ministers to obtain redress for the injury inflicted upon us by
Captain Wilks. We sincerely wish that, inasmuch as it was well known
that they had sent out to the Government at Washington a courteous but
firm demand for reparation, and inasmuch as it could not be known that
such demand would be rejected, there had been less of angry excitement
during the interval. That portion of the public press which for the
last month has been labouring with great power, and, we are compelled
to confess, with too much success, to inflame the warlike passions of
the British people by parading before them as a premeditated and
defiant insult what turns out to have been the rash and foolhardy act
of a naval captain, committed on his own responsibility, has done
itself and the people of this country but little credit. Had it been
necessary to stimulate our own rulers to the performance of what was
due to the honour of this nation, some extenuation, if not excuse,
might have been pleaded for pursuing this course. But no such
necessity existed, or was believed to exist. Neither could the
extravagant and fierce denunciation of the American people and their
institutions contribute in the smallest degree to the pacific decision
of the Federal Government; for the greater part of it will have been
read across the Atlantic only after the offence has been disclaimed
and the reparation made. Unhappily, we have allowed ourselves to be
goaded into an unseemly display of passionate indignation, without any
obvious necessity and before the fitting occasion for it had arisen,
to the manifest danger of increasing the ill-will of America and the
exposure of ourselves to ridicule in the eyes of foreign nations. The
inconvenience which will, no doubt, accrue to us from this want of
self-restraint may well teach us that, when a people have taken the
proper steps to vindicate their national honour, it becomes them to
await the issue with self-possession and calm forbearance.</p>
<p>The events of the past month will, we trust, impress upon the minds
of our countrymen another lesson. The occasion has been one on which
the Emperor of the French, if actuated by the secret hostility to this
country which not a few have persistently laid to his charge, might,
without going out of his way, have turned to a selfish account by
leaving it to take its course. A war between England and America would
have made him master of the situation in Europe. Once more, as in the
presence of the Indian mutiny, he has rebuked our distrust by the
loyalty of his behaviour. He chose to throw the whole weight of his
immense influence with the Cabinet at Washington into the scale of
peace by urging a frank concession of our demand. We trust the fact so
honourable to his Government will be borne in mind when next an
attempt is made to sow between him and ourselves the seeds of a
groundless suspicion.</p>
<p>Lastly, let us, in parting from this subject, express our earnest
hope, as we have taken occasion to do more than once already, that the
difficulty from which we have just escaped will lead to a liberal
revision of maritime law. It is susceptible of vast amendments in
favour of neutral commerce, and, we believe, the policy of Great
Britain has hitherto been the chief obstacle to their being
effected. If the painful excitement through which we have passed
should conduce to the framing and establishment of a clear and
reasonable maritime code, the benefit will have been cheaply purchased
by the outlay to which we have been subjected by the affair of the
Trent. In that case the event will have furnished the happiest modern
solution of Samson's riddle, "Out of the eater came forth meat, and
out of the strong came forth sweetness."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Edinburgh and Nova Scotian we have news from
New York to the 4th inst. The chief points of interest are the
departure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell and their secretaries, and the
suspension of cash payments by the United States' Treasury and the
banks.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DEPARTURE OF MESSRS. MAS0N AND SLIDELL.</p>
<p>The Boston <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi> of the 30th ult. says:&#x2014;</p>
<p>There was no communication with Port Warren on the 28th, in
consequence of the gale, and the prisoners taken from the Trent were
ignorant of the decision of the National Government in favour of their
release. Next day newspapers were carried down, containing the
official correspondence, and Mr. Mason was noticed at the window of
his room perusing the intelligence with a smile of satisfaction upon
his countenance.</p>
<p> On the 1st inst., at eleven o'clock, the four prisoners left Fort
Warren, in Boston Harbour, very quietly, and went on board the steam
tug-boat Starlight, and were conveyed to Provincetown, on the northern
extremity of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where they were received by the
British steam gun-boat Rinaldo, which was to convey them to Halifax,
Nova Scotia, whence they would be conveyed to England by the Cunard
steamer.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EUGENIA SMITH CASE.</p>
<p>Orders have been given by the Government for the release of
Messrs. Zacchiri and Rogers, taken from the British schooner Eugenia
Smith by the United States' steamer Santiago de Cuba.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE CABINET.</p>
<p>A usually well-informed correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New
York Tribune</hi> gives the following account of what passed within
the White House in reference to the Trent affair:&#x2014;</p>
<p>At the first Cabinet meeting held after the seizure of
Messrs. Slidell and Mason, the President expressed himself in favour
of restoring them to the protection of the British flag if it should
be demanded. He said it was doubtful if the course of Captain Wilks
could be justified by international law; and that, at all events, he
could not afford to have two wars on his hands at the same
time. Attorney-General Bates echoed this opinion. He thought the
seizure unjustifiable, and was in favour of giving up the men upon
demand. Secretary Seward was non-committal. The other members of the
Cabinet disagreed with Mr. Lincoln positively; and Secretary Chase
argued forcibly and with warmth that the course recommended by the
President would be dishonourable to the United States as a
nation. Thus matters stood until the first belligerent note from
England. No further discussions took place, nor was the question again
mooted in the Cabinet until Christmas Day. The despatch from Earl
Russell to Lord Lyons was delivered at the State department on
Saturday, as we telegraphed the next day, and Mr. Seward immediately
went to work on his reply. Remembering the views of the Cabinet
previously expressed, Mr. Lincoln was not in haste to call them
together. One meeting was adjourned to prevent premature discussion,
and another on the regular day did not take place. The first was on
Christmas Day, and after Lord Lyons had made his
communication. Immediately M. Thouvenel's despatch had been delivered,
Mr. Seward's reply was read to the Council, in a session prolonged for
five hours. The despatch of M. Thouvenel had convinced the opponents
of the policy of surrender that the public opinion of Europe would
sustain England, and it was used to secure unanimity in that
policy. Mr. Seward's despatch, however, was subjected to much
criticism. Many alterations and modifications were suggested. The next
day a revised copy was read to the adjourned Cabinet meeting; further
changes were suggested; and the despatch, as a whole, was not approved
and adopted until Friday morning.</p>

<p rend="center">THE TONE OF THE PRESS.</p>
<p>The tone of the American press, taken as a whole, is much less
hostile to England since the settlement of the Trent difficulty than
it had been for many months previous. The Philadelphia papers are more
bitter than those of New York and Boston. There is, however, an uneasy
impression abroad that the British Government is only seeking an
opportunity for breaking the blockade of the Southern ports for the
sake of dismembering the Union and procuring a supply of cotton.</p>

<p rend="center">THE SUSPENSION OF CASH PAYMENTS.</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the 28th ult., the New York bankers held a
meeting and agreed to suspend cash payments from the 30th ult. This
example was followed by the banks throughout the country. The specie
in the vaults of the New York banks had fallen from 50,000,000 to
24,000,000 dols. Exchange on England had risen to 113, gold was
already at a premium of l&#xBD; to 2 per cent. The banks had
informed the Government that they could give it no more aid. They
refused to take the fourth loan of 50,000,000 dols. asked by the
Federal Government. The scheme of Mr. Chase for superseding the
ordinary bank currency by an issue of Government notes had been
dropped. The commercial classes were pressing on Congress the
necessity of providing a revenue to the amount of at least 150,000,000
dols. The popular subscriptions to the national loan are now merely
nominal in New York, not amounting to 100,000 dols. a week.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>
<p>The Senate has agreed to Mr. Sumner's resolution, asking the
President to transmit to the Senate all the correspondence which has
taken place since the Paris Congress in relation to neutral and
belligerent rights upon the ocean.</p>
<p>Mr. Stevens had introduced into the House of Representatives a bill
for abolishing Southern ports of entry.</p>
<p>The Navy Department had sent out specifications inviting proposals
from shipbuilders throughout the country for the construction of
ironclad steam-batteries. The commission appointed to examine the
Stevens floating-battery had reported against it.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had been confined to his bed for ten days by a
depressing attack of low typhoid fever. At last accounts his health
had somewhat improved.</p>
<p>The Comte de Paris and the Duc de Chartres, acting, it is said, on
the advice of their mother, had resigned their commissions in the
Federal service.</p>
<p>New-Year's Day was marked by especial cordiality on the part of the
diplomatic corps. All the Foreign Ministers, with their Legations,
were present at the official reception at the White House, and all
subsequently called on the Secretary of State. The presence of the
entire British and French Legations at both places was especially
noticed.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>There have been destructive fires both in Nashville, Charleston,
and Richmond. In the former city the commissary stores, including a
portion of the Ordnance Department, and valued at one million dollars,
were destroyed. In Richmond the theatre had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The Confederates in Kentucky had destroyed a large portion of the
railway between Louisville and Nashville.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> states that a large
Federal force from Beaufort had landed at North Edisto, on the South
Carolina <sic/></p>

<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The return of the chief emigration agent of the Canadian Government
for the year 1861 shows that the troubles in the neighbouring country
have partially turned the tide of European emigration towards
Canada. The gross total of persons landed in 1861 was 19,923, against
only 10,150 in 1860. This gives an increase of nearly 100 per cent;
and the agent "has every reason to believe" that the year just entered
upon will show, if Canada is spared the calamity of war, as large an
increase of immigration in 1862 over that of 1861 as that of 1861 was
in excess of the previous year. The nationalities of the immigrants
were:&#x2014;Norwegians, 8814; English, 3579; Irish, 3160; Scotch, 2011;
Germans, 2182; Russian Poles, 27; French, 10; United States' Citizens,
12; Canadians and others, 371. The destination of about half was the
United States.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ADDITIONAL OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE ON THE<lb/>TRENT AFFAIR.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> Tuesday's <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> are published some
documents making an important addition to the large mass of official
correspondence which has already been published with reference to the
Mason-Slidell case. These documents more immediately concern the
course of our own Foreign Office in the matter.</p>
<p>On the 19th of December Earl Russell wrote to Lord Lyons, giving
the details of an interview which took place on that day between his
Lordship and Mr. Adams, the American Minister. On that occasion
Mr. Adams communicated to our Foreign Secretary the substance of
Mr. Seward's despatch, declaring that Captain Wilks, in seizing the
two Southern Commissioners and their secretaries, had acted without
the authority of the Washington Government, which stood "quite
uncommitted" on the question at issue. The noble Earl's comment upon
this explanation was, that he "thought it would stand in place of an
apology." On the point which still remained to he settled, Lord Lyons
was instructed as follows:&#x2014; "If he (Mr. Seward) asks what will be the
consequence of his refusing compliance, I think you should say that
you wish to leave him and the President quite free to take their own
course, and that you desire to abstain from anything like menace."
Mr. Adams asked Lord Russell point-blank, "whether, if Lord Lyons came
away a declaration of war would be the immediate consequence?"&#x2014;a
question to which the noble Earl replied that "nothing was decided on
that point; we should wait for a reply from America, and then decide
upon our course."</p>
<p>In a despatch dated January 11, Lord Russell has the satisfaction of
announcing to our Minister at Washington&#x2014;who is thanked for the
"discretion and good temper" he has manifested in this important
matter&#x2014;that the liberation of the prisoners and the explanations
offered by Mr. Seward "constituted the reparation which her Majesty
and the British nation had a right to expect." His Excellency was,
however, informed that her Majesty's Government could not assent to
the conclusions arrived at by the Federal Secretary of State on some
points of international law, and that the discussion of these
questions would form the subject of a special despatch. "In the
meantime," adds Lord Russell, "it will be desirable that the
commanders of the United States' cruisers should be instructed not to
repeat acts for which the British Government will have to ask for
redress and which the United States' Government cannot undertake to
justify."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ADVANCED POST OF GENERAL BLENKER'S DIVISION
SURPRISED<lb/> BY CONFEDERATE CAVALRY.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist in the Federal camp,
visiting the advanced posts on the 12th ult., came upon General
Blenker's pickets at <sic>Auandale</sic>, about ten miles from Washington. Whilst
he was in the neighbourhood a dash was made at them by a squadron of
Confederate cavalry&#x2014;fine, rough-looking fellows, dressed in
nondescript uniforms, red shirts, grey tunics; some with boots and
some without; armed with sabres and revolvers. Many of them were very
powerfully built, and as they rushed in among the men of the 45th New

<p rend="center">THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL RAILWAY SUSPENSION<lb/> BRIDGE OVER THE
NIAGARA RIVER.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> magnificent work was erected for the
purpose of connecting the New York Central and the Great Western of
Canada Railways, and the cost was contributed by both companies in
equal portions. It is by means of this bridge only that an unbroken
journey can be made from New York, or Boston, to the western part of
Canada, without changing carriages; the consequence of which is, that
the best and cheapest route to the west, not only of Canada, but also
of the United States, is still by the New York Central and the Great
Western of Canada Railways, although many other western routes have
sprung into existence since this was completed. Chicago and the
western prairie country generally are reached by this route more
easily than by any other, as is also Detroit and all parts of
Michigan.</p> 
<p>The great bridge the subject of our present notice was not the
first of the kind which spanned the gorge of the Niagara River, an
ingenious suspension-bridge having been constructed across it many
years ago by Mr. C. Ellett, but of very fragile and temporary
character when compared with the present work.</p>
<p>The Niagara Railway Suspension-bridge was erected from the designs,
and under the personal superintendence, of Mr. John A. Roebling, at a
cost of 400,000 dols. The first engine crossed over it on the 8th of
March, 1855. It carries a double line of rails on the upper part, and
an ample roadway for carriages below.</p>
<p>The plan adopted in the construction of this suspension-bridge
differs materially from those usually built in England. Instead of
flat wrought-iron plate-links, connected together by pins passing
through their extremities, Mr. Roebling uses a simple wire-cable, or
rather four wire cables, each 10in. in diameter, and composed of 3640
separate wires, the whole of the cables being capable of bearing a
weight of 12,000 tons; the actual load they carry never exceeds 1000
tons. The wire ropes are securely anchored in the solid rock,
30ft. below the surface; they pass over the summits of four solid
stone towers, 80ft. in height. Beside the wire cables there are 624
suspending-rods, whose ultimate strength is equal to 18,720 tons;
these support the roadway at different parts, and are connected with
the cables above. There are also sixty-four over-floor stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1920 tons, and fifty-six river-stays, whose
ultimate strength is 1680 tons; these latter stays extend from the
bridge to the rocks on either side of the ravine. The total length of
span between the towers is 800ft., and the "railway track," as it is
always called in America, is 250ft. above the surface of the water in
the river.</p>
<p>The great object sought to be obtained in this remarkable bridge,
after strength to carry its load, was rigidity; for in all
suspension-bridges, as ordinarily constructed, the deflection and
oscillation would be such as to entirely prevent their being used for
the purposes of carrying railway traffic. The Niagara Suspension
Railway-bridge, although not perfectly rigid, is sufficiently so to
allow of heavily-laden trains passing over it at a maximum speed of
five miles per hour; even then a very considerable deflection takes
place, but not such as to in any way betray weakness; on the contrary,
it is rather an indication<pb n="68"/> of strength, as showing the
correct action of all its parts, by which means a true bearing is
obtained over every part of it.</p>
<p>A wonderful amount of ingenuity and mechanical skill is displayed
in the construction of the roadway, which forms a species of lattice
or tubular girder, the railway track being on the top outside, and the
carriage roadway on the bottom inside. The frequent admixture of wood
and iron, and the numberless small bolts and screws passing through
the former material, will require constant care and supervision to
prevent decay occurring, and may probably cause the cost of
maintenance of the bridge to be excessive. Portions are now being
constantly renewed, and always with an increased strengthening of the
parts. The bridge, however, taken as a whole, must be looked upon as a
decided success and a triumph of American engineering skill; while the
advantages of a perfect communication between the United States and
the most valuable portions of the British possessions in North America
cannot be overrated. The general effect of the Niagara
Suspension-bridge is that of extreme lightness and beauty; the
situation in which it is placed is exceedingly fine, being in view of
the Great Falls, while below it the Niagara River rushes through its
confined channel, a foaming, noisy rapid 150ft. deep, almost as
terrible in its roar and force as the mighty cataract itself.</p>
<p>A bridge similar to the Niagara Suspension-bridge, and of even
greater span, but only carrying an ordinary roadway, ha[s] been
built over the River St. John, in the city of St. John, in New
Brunswick. This bridge, some time after it was erected, gave way
during a terrific gale of wind. The suspension cables remained sound
and fully equal to their duty; but the roadway had been insecurely
connected with the abutments, and it broke adrift at that point. The
whole length of roadway oscillated many feet clear of the abutment
altogether, yet only a portion of it gave way, the bridge proving
itself in all other respects equal to withstanding strains that it
never was expected to be subjected to.</p></div2>

destroyed by fire. Between 200 and 300 horses were either burnt to
death or received such injuries that it was deemed humane to destroy them. More than 1000 sets of harness were also destroyed.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Etna we have news from New York to the
evening of the 11th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">WAR NEWS.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had not yet fully recovered from his attack of
typhoid fever, but had taken several airings in a carriage.</p>
<p>General Burnside's expedition had left Annapolis and would
rendezvous at Hampton Roads. The precise destination of this
expedition has been kept a profound secret. The Boston <hi rend="italic">Traveller</hi> announces that several divisions of the
army of the Potomac will reinforce this expedition.</p>
<p>A fight is reported to have taken place at Huntersville, in Western
Virginia, in which the Confederates retired with loss in killed,
wounded, clothing, and stores.</p>
<p>A portion of the Mississippi expedition had already started on its
mission, which is supposed to be an attack on Nashville.</p>
<p>The steamer Vanderbilt had arrived in New York from Port Royal with
about 700 full bales of Sea Island cotton.</p><pb n="81"/>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S COURTESY.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has tendered to Lord Lyons permission to the British
troops en route to Canada to land at Portland, and proceed by railroad
through Maine to their destination.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The Richmond papers declare that their army is suffering severely
from the cold and that it is to a great extent demoralised. They think
that Great Britain will not be satisfied with Mr. Seward's despatch
upon the Trent question, and will make further demands. The Richmond
<hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> thinks that the sinking the stone fleet
will do no harm to the city of Charleston, but will render it
impregnable to a sea attack. Since the sinking of that fleet the
steamer Ella Warley, from Nassau, ran into Charleston with a cargo of
arms, medicines, and other stores. Several vessels have left the
harbour and run to sea by other channels, one of which has recently
arrived in Liverpool. The captain saw nothing of the blockading
fleet.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>
<p>In a debate in the House of Representatives on the Trent question
Mr. Vallandigham expressed himself dissatisfied with the surrender of
Messrs. Mason and Slidell. He said that America would be at war with
England in less than three months unless the Federal Government tamely
submit to the recognition of the South and the raising of the
blockade. Mr. Hutchins, of Ohio, considered that Mr. Vallandigham
wanted war with England for the benefit of the South. Mr. Thomas, of
Massachusetts, was of opinion that England had done that which had
implanted in the American breast a sense of wrong which would wait the
opportunity to strike a blow of retributive justice.</p>
<p>Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate's Committee of Foreign
Affairs, has spoken in the Senate, and taken positions similar to
those of M. Thouvenel and in advance of those taken by Mr. Seward. He
said:&#x2014;</p>
<p>If Captain Wilks suspected the Trent he should have taken her into
port for decision. No Federal court, however, recognising American
precedents, could have lawfully condemned the Trent or detained the
Commissioner[s]. The American Government has committed itself fully and
unreservedly to the right of a neutral flag to cover civil
passengers. The question has been argued with the greatest ability and
thoroughness by the most eminent American statesmen, including
Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, and other Presidents, and the whole record
of American diplomacy is luminous with arguments against such acts as
that of Captain Wilks. Captain Wilks, misled by a British law book,
violated American principles. England, by demanding the Commissioners,
stultified her history and virtually acknowledged the justice of a
position long maintained by America. The American people (concluded
Mr. Sumner) are indebted to Captain Wilke's act and Mr. Seward's
statesmanship for a great political triumph.</p>
<p>The Naval Committee has reported on a bill for the construction of
twenty iron-plated steam gun-boats.</p>
<p>The Committee of Ways and Means have reported a bill authorising
the issue of 100,000,000 dols. worth of demand notes, which will
constitute a legal tender, be receivable for Government dues, and
exchangeable at any time for Six per Cent Bonds, redeemable in twenty
years.</p>

<p rend="center">TRADE AND FINANCE.</p>
<p>Exchange on London has risen to 114; gold to 4 per cent premium,
and silver to 1&#xBD; per cent premium. The imports of foreign dry
goods into the port of New York for the year 1861 amount to 43,600,000
dols., against 101,800,000 in 1860, being a fall in one year of 63 per
cent. In the year after the celebrated financial crisis (1858) the
imports amounted to 61,000,000 dols. The arrivals in New York of
passengers from foreign ports were 80,790 in 1861, against 266,627 in
1860; of passengers from California, 9117 against 10,710 in 1860.</p>

<p rend="center">ADDRESS OF CONDOLENCE WITH THE QUEEN.</p>
<p>At a crowded meeting of British residents held at the English
Consulate in New York an address of sympathy and condolence with the
Queen was adopted.</p>

<p rend="center">NEWSPAPER CENSORSHIP IN MISSOURI.</p>
<p>The Provost Marshal of St. Louis has notified to all newspapers
appearing outside that city that a copy of each issue must be sent him
for inspection, under penalty of suppression.</p>

<p rend="center">THE GOVERNORS' MESSAGES.</p>
<p>The opening of the year is the season when most of the State
Governors present their annual messages to their respective
Legislatures. The Governor of the Border State of Maine complains of
the deep and bitter hostility of large numbers of the people of New
Brunswick and Canada. He thinks that Portland should be made the
Quebec and Halifax of the United States, and that with only present
means of defence Portland would in the event of a war with Great
Britain soon be in possession of the enemy. It is requisite for these
purposes not only to construct military works on the coast, but
military railroads for their connexion with one another. If the United
States do not at once set about these works, Maine must do so on her
own account. He complains that the attitude of England has been marked
by many exhibitions of the most positive unkindness and ill-will,
while her friendship for the rebels has been manifested by an unbroken
succession of favours, valuable in themselves, but more valuable for
the hopes encouraged by the ostentatious manner in which they were
conferred. "We have all thought till recently that war with England
was scarcely within the category of possible events. That she should
make a war which she must know this country would feel and history
would record was waged by her in the history of barbarism and wrong,
and designed to inflict an irreparable and unprovoked injury upon a
nation which had been, in honest faith, her best friend and, as far as
the wishes of its people were concerned, her truest ally, was what the
American people could not believe."</p>
<p>The Governor of Michigan, another Border State, speaks "of the
manifest disposition of foreign Powers to intermeddle with our
domestic affairs," and recommends the Federal Government to establish
at some convenient point in the north-west an arsenal and manufactory
of arms, and also a naval station, to be located in Michigan.</p>
<p>The Mayor of New York, in his Message, urges that rafts or other
barriers should be anchored at the Narrows, in readiness to obstruct
the channel, if necessary.</p>

<p rend="center">DESPATCHES FROM LORD LYONS TO EARL RUSSELL.</p>
<p>In Friday's <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> were published copies
of some despatches from Lord Lyons. The first informs Earl Russell
that Messrs. <sic>Zacharie</sic> and Rogers, taken from on board the Eugenia
Smith, under the British flag, and confined in Fort Lafayette, had
been released, and the act disavowed; a second refers to a case in
which a captured British schooner, the James Campbell, was taken into
port with the British flag flying under the American-a proceeding
which has been rebuked by Mr. Seward, and ordered not to be repeated;
and the third relates that certain English seamen, captured for a
break of blockade, having been required to take an oath never to be
engaged in such a proceeding again, have been declared by Mr. Seward
absolved from such oath.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE TUSCARORA IN SOUTHAMPTON WATER.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> vessel, whose presence in Southampton Water has caused the greatest excitement for the last fortnight, still keeps her position off

the mouth of the Itchen, supposed to be waiting the arrival of the

Sumter and holding a sharp look out on the movements of the Nashville,
still safely berthed in Southampton Docks. On Monday week the
Tuscarora weighed, and proceeded down the water, anchoring for the day
between Calshot Castle and the Lightship, returning to her old
moorings in the evening. On the following Thursday she made an
excursion round the Isle of Wight, and completed her cruise by
bringing up off Osborne, which quarters she quickly received notice to
leave, and she then returned to her old position as shown  in our
Engraving. She is a smart, handsome-looking craft, heavily armed, with
eight Dalhgren guns&#x2014;two of them, placed amidships, are the
famous columbiad 120-pounders&#x2014;and a rifled 30-pounder of Parrot's on her forecastle. She is commanded by Captain Craven, and has a large and well-appointed crew of 200 men.</p>

<p>Messrs. Slidell and Mason and their secretaries have sailed from Halifax for Bermuda.</p>

<p>The United States' Government is erecting batteries on Croil's
island in the Long Sault of the St. Lawrence. These batteries will command
the Canadian Cornwall Canal.</p>

<p>The Confederate steamer Sumter was ordered on Saturday last
to quit Cadiz within six hours. She accordingly proceeded to Gibraltar.
Before entering that port she captured two American vessels, one of which she burned, releasing the other, apparently because she was bound to a British port, and was laden with a cargo belonging to neutrals.</p>

<p>The West Indian, a vessel belonging to a Southern planter, has
arrived at Liverpool direct from Charleston, having successfully run
the blockade. She is 241 tons burden, and has a full cargo of spirits
of turpentine. She left Charleston in the evening of the 24th of
December. It was a fine starlight night, with a favourable wind; the
blockade was run without meeting with any of the blockading fleet. The West Indian left Charleston

after the stone fleet had been sunk, and ran down to the sea through one of

 channels left open by the Federals.</p> </div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 25, 1862.</p>
<p>...Once more we hear from America that a grand movement by the North
is in hand. Land and water armaments are to penetrate into the heart
of the South, Nashville is to be taken, and then a great blow is to be
struck at New Orleans. We can only say, as heretofore, that we shall
see. The Mississippi will now be the centre of interest for the
spectators of the strife. The sinews of war are to be provided by a
tax of 150 millions of dollars, at least such is the resolution of the
Congressional Committee of Ways and Means. There had been some violent
anti-English language in both Houses, but it seems to have expressed
the feelings of a miserable minority, the people generally being bent
upon the prosecution of the war with the South. It was said that the
vindictive effort to destroy Charleston harbour was not likely to be
very mischievous, some reports declaring that the sinking of the
vessels would actually facilitate the improvement of the port, while
Southern organs thank the North for having made the city
impregnable. The American question has not received much public
discussion here during the week, save that Mr. Massey, the Chairman of
Committees and in some sort a Government authority, has delivered a
speech in which he manifested a desire that the blockade should be
broken. The journals of the Southern States believe that Lord
Palmerston's Government are friendly to the North, and that the people
of England are inclined towards the South; and therefore the slave
journalists venture to predict a speedy fall for our present
Administration. We cite this in evidence of the utter ignorance of
the Americans of English affairs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>As regards foreign affairs there is not much to record, except that
the Spanish expedition to Mexico is left to do the principal part of
the work of amelioration; and the commander seems inclined to perform
his duties in an effective way, and one which would probably invite
unfriendly interference by the United States if they were united and
had not their hands full. But circumstances forbid the enforcement of
the insolent and nonsensical doctrine that the Powers of the East have
no right to interfere in the affairs of the Western World, a bit of
geographical pedantry which will certainly not be tolerated in
Europe. The interests of the New World are too important to the Old
to permit their being left in the hands of any single nation.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">MR. YANCEY, COMMISSIONER OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Hon. Wm. Lowndes Yancey is a native
of the State of South Carolina, where he was born in 1815. For many
years past he has resided in the great Cotton State of
Alabama. Mr. Yancey is a cotton-planter, and until the date of
secession of Alabama was a member of the Bar of that State.</p>
<p>Though exercising a strong influence upon the politics of the South
during the last twenty years Mr. Yancey has but rarely been a
candidate for political honours. He has, however, served as a member
of the House of Representatives and of the Senate of Alabama, and has
also been a member of the Federal Congress at Washington. While in
Congress he took a prominent part in the annexation of Texas and in
the settlement of the difficulties between England and the United
States with reference to the disputed territory of Oregon. He was the
first in Congress to denounce the party in that body who desired to
repeal the convention for the joint occupancy of Oregon, entered into
in 1818, contending that such a repeal under the circumstances would
lead to a war with Great Britain, which he strongly disapproved of. He
also voted for the extension of the Missouri Compromise line to the
Pacific Ocean, his object being to withdraw the slavery question from
Congress, if possible, and thus to lessen the causes of irritation
between the North and South. The Northern vote, however, defeated the
measure.</p>

<p>Mr. Yancey's chief claim to public notice rests in his early
recognition of the ineradicable differences existing between the North
and South, and which time, instead of diminishing, extended and
strengthened. In his opinion these differences were fast
sectionalising the people of the North and the South, and he
predicted that the Union would be dissolved whenever they stood arrayed
as sections, the one against the other.</p>

<p>In a public letter, written several years since, which excited great
attention at the time, he gave it as his opinion that the South would
no longer submit to further compromise of what she considered to be
her constitutional rights, that neither parties nor compromises could
save the Union, that its dissolution was but a question of time, and
that it would first take place in the Cotton States, and thence would
spread into the Border States&#x2014;a prediction that has been signally
verified within the last few months.</p>

<p>The events in progress in the Northern States, showing that the
North would present a candidate for the Presidency upon an avowed
sectional basis in 1860, induced Mr. Yancey in 1859 to urge upon the
Legislature of Alabama the passing of an Act making it the duty of the
Governor to call a convention of the people of that State to consider
so serious an event. When, in 1860, Mr. Lincoln was elected as an
exponent of Northern, and an enemy of Southern, interests, the
convention of Alabama was immediately called, followed by those of all
the other Cotton States, the whole of which deliberately withdrew
from the Union, and, on the 11th of March, 1861, formed the Government
of the Confederate States of America. Mr. Yancey was at this time a
leading member of the convention of Alabama, and reported the
ordinance of secession.</p>

<p>In selecting three gentlemen to form a commission to the Powers of
Europe to present the claims of the Confederate States to recognition
and friendly commercial relations, President Davis considered it an
occasion to recognise the long persistent services of Mr. Yancey in
the cause of the South; and, as he had been the first to urge and
obtain the consent of the South to secede and form an independent
Confederacy, it was felt that he should be the first in a commission
to obtain recognition of the new Power from the elder nations of the
earth, and especially from Great Britain and France. Hence Mr. Yancey
was appointed to be the senior or chief of the commission to Europe,
and has been in this country
 and in France in that capacity since May last.</p>

<p> In November last Alabama elected Mr.Yancey to represent her in the
Senate of the Confederate States, which will be organised on the 17th
of February next, the day when the permanent supersedes the present
provisional Government of the South.</p>

 <p rend="center">A NIGHT ALARM IN THE FEDERAL CAMP.</p>

 <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Frequently</hi> there are alarms in the
 Federal camp on the Potomac at night caused by the driving in of the
 pickets and the appearance in force of the Confederates at different
 points of the Union lines. On these occasions it is necessary to
 communicate with the Commander-in-Chief, and to do this expeditiously
 a new system of signals has been introduced into the Federal army. By
 day messages are sent from one division to another by the use of
 differently coloured flags, thus doing away with the necessity of
 dispatching mounted troopers with written orders; and by night
 lamp-torches take their place with the same effect. These signals can
 be used with an army in motion, the corps attached to the different
 brigades occupying as they move all elevations or lofty buildings on
 their route. The accompanying Illustration represents the signals at
 work by night. At the signalman's feet lies a large brass lamp, which
 is the axis around which the motive light forms its
 curves&#x2014;each curve, according to the direction which it takes,
 signifying a number, the meaning of which number being known only to
 the officer commanding each corps.</p>

<p rend="center">ADVANCE OF THE SKIRMISHERS OF THE <lb/> BUCKTAIL RIFLES ON DRAINSVILLE.</p>

<p>The heroes of the fight at Drainsvllle, Virginia, on the 20th ult.,
were the Bucktail Riflemen, a corps of sharpshooters raised in the
mountains of Pennsylvania. To be eligible for service in this corps
each man must have shot a buck, and hence the badge the members
 wear on their caps, and the name they bear. The forces engaged in
 this fight&#x2014;almost the only success which the Federals have gained in the
 field in that neighbourhood&#x2014;were the brigades of General Stuart on
 the Confederate side, and of General Ord, Unionist, to the latter of which
the Bucktails belong. The incident illustrated on the first page is
where the riflemen are advancing their skirmishers through the
undergrowth towards the Confederate gum, while other Federal regiments
are making a flanking movement by a detour on each side to clear
 the pine woods. The Bucktails were consequently exposed to the
 severest fire during the action, and suffered the most. But the number
 of dead left by the Confederates in the field in front of their 
position&#x2014;nearly all of whom were shot through the
head&#x2014;show that they also paid dearly for the
 losses suffered by the rifles.</p>

<p rend="center">OUR RELATIONS WITH AMERICA.</p>
<p>Is it our unhappy destiny to become involved in a third war with
the people of the United States, with whom we have so many ties of
language, race, religion, and laws? This is an apprehension which
weighs heavily on the public mind at the present moment, and which
Mr. Seward's high-flying diplomacy, concurring with the incensed temper
towards England of the Northern people, will not allow us to
stifle. "The relations between the two countries," said Mr. Gladstone,
at Leith, "afford a thousand points of contact every day, and must
necessarily likewise afford opportunities for collision." He would be
a bold man who would be willing to give assurance that those
opportunities will always be met in a spirit of mutual forbearance and
concession. The British Americans, whose situation compels them to a
close acquaintance with the character and tendencies of their
neighbours, forewarn us with ominous unanimity that the evil day is
only postponed, not conjured away for ever. How the events of the last
twelvemonth have necessarily resulted in bringing an American war,
which seemed so distant in 1860, into the foreground of our national
prospects merits a brief explanation.</p>

<p>The eleven "Confederate" States, in seceding, shattered with the
same blow the Union and Constitution of 1787 and the basis on which
peace between Britain and the Union had hitherto rested. Without
forgetting the influence in behalf of international amity wielded by a
small section of New England politicians, of whom the late Daniel
Webster and Charles Sumner are the best-known representatives, we
must, nevertheless, mainly attribute the maintenance of peace for the
last thirty years to the unwillingness of Southern politicians to
initiate a war which, if successful, could only result in
strengthening the Northern States by adding to them a territory which
would immediately give at least four anti-slavery States to the Union
and overbalance Slave-soil acquisitions at the South by immense
Free-soil acquisitions at the North. It is patent to every one that
those who struggled so fiercely and fraudulently to wrest the single
State of Kansas from a Northern immigration would be in no hurry
(however great their dislike  of British influence) to make sacrifices
to annex British America to the Union. They therefore judged it
politic to bridle the bellicose propensities of the people of the
Middle and Western States and to put them off with a succession of
vexatious international disputes never meant to be urged to the issue
of war. From this situation resulted peace, but a peace little to be
envied, because it was a peace without amity, and sometimes even
without common courtesy. On several occasions of late years it cannot
be denied that the English nation have felt that this was a situation
which benefited their political and commercial interests at the
expense of their honour.</p>

<p> This guarantee of peace is now withdrawn, and we look around in
vain to find a substitute. The South can never again be to us what she
has been. If in the present conflict she is able to maintain her
independence, then the Northern people stand alone, absolute masters
of their own destiny. If, on the other hand, the South is subjugated
by the North, she will use whatever political influence she may
hereafter possess in the Union to precipitate a foreign war, in order
that she may find therein a splendid opportunity for revolt, and a
sweet occasion for revenge. It is bootless to inquire whether the
independence or the reconquest of the South would be the most
unfavourable combination for the continuance of pace with the British
empire. It is sufficient that neither one contingency nor the other
offers any stable basis on which we could reasonably rest our hopes. A
new experiment would commence&#x2014;that of administering British
rule on the American continent alongside of a multitudinous,
pugnacious, anti-British, and henceforth <hi rend="italic">unchecked</hi> democracy, dwelling south of the
St. Lawrence and the lakes. Who says that this experiment will he
allowed to evolve itself without interruption? Not the British
Americans, nor those best acquainted with the ideas and passions of
the Americans of the North. This ever-present apprehension of war, and
all the expense of preparation that it involves, is what we must
henceforward resign ourselves to pay as the price of our continued
dominion on the American continent; and it is highly flattering to our
national self-love that no voice has been heard in any part of British
America praying us to remove our flag, although the knowledge that the
proximity of that flag is a chronic source of irritation to the
neighbouring democracy is possessed by every schoolboy in Canada.</p>
 
<p>But if a third war with the United States be an only too probable
occurrence, then it may be said, the sooner it comes the better. "Let
us accept the first gage of battle thrown down by the Transatlantic
Demos and punish them for their rash arrogance by ensuring the
dismemberment of the Union." This is the hasty logic of the
soldier. The statesman and the moralist will argue quite
differently. Conceding that in a merely military point of view the
conditions may never be so favourable to our side as during the
existence of the present troubles, we unhesitatingly affirm that they
can hardly ever be so unfavourable in a political, commercial, and moral
point of view. If we should be tempted to pick up the glove thrown
down by a passionate people in their hour of difficulty and distress
the British nation would never be forgiven by any class or section of
the Northern people. If through any direct agency of this nation their
idolised Union were dismembered, what would be the result? Keenly
watching every turn of the world's kaleidoscope, the Northerners would
subordinate their whole foreign policy to the fanatical prosecution of
one idea&#x2014;that of dismembering the British empire and
humiliating the British nation. Mr. Seward has already given us a
friendly hint of the prospects of our trade with the United States in
such an event. Conscious of the resentful character of his own people,
he shudders as he contemplates a contingency "which will leave<hi rend="italic"> no
roots remaining</hi> out of which trade between the United States and Great
Britain, as it has hitherto flourished,<hi rend="italic"> can ever again spring up</hi>." If
our manufactures would be excluded how could our English and Scottish
immigrants hope to fare? From the Atlantic to the Pacific the United
States would be too hotly vindictive towards our race and name to
offer an asylum to our emigration. This is consideration of no small
moment to our middle and working classes, from whose ranks the whole
of our emigration proceeds.</p>

<p>We could expect no compensation for this terrible hostility in the
ardent attachment of the Confederate States, whose independence we
should have established. There is a moral gulf between the British and
Slave State people which no accidental, ephemeral, political, and
military alliance could bridge over. The Southern Confederacy, if it
can make good its independence by its own unaided resources, will
probably offer to our commerce better terms than it ever enjoyed under
the old Union; while the creation of a balance of power on the
American continent would be viewed without regret as well by Great
Britain as by the other nations of the Old and New Worlds. But these
advantages must be won for us, if at all, by Southern patriotism, and
not by English interference.</p>

<p>If these premises be correct, they lead up to this conclusion, that it
is our truest policy to exercise great forbearance towards the United
States during the course of the present war and to avoid doing anything
which seems to evince a desire to take advantage of their temporary
difficulties. It is not conceivable that any cause of difference can
arise between the two nations during this crisis which the
embarrassed nation would not be willing to refer to the arbitration of
a third party. It would  be our duty and interest to give as wide an
extension to the principle of arbitration as possible; but, in the
event of cases arising which in the opinion of our statesmen could not
with propriety be referred to an umpire, then we could well afford to
be magnanimous, and wait to vindicate our honour until the United
States had their hands disengaged. Europe could not misinterpret our
motives, and the American Democracy are no longer under the delusion
that Britain "cannot be kicked into a war" with their irresistible
selves. But, indeed, the very readiness on our part to take such a
generous position would not fail to touch the heart of the American
people, and dispose them to make reparation for whatever injury or
insult they might have inflicted on us. It would also do much towards
creating such a feeling between the two nations as would postpone for
a long time, if it did not for ever avert, the outbreak of another
war. As the older, sager, and, as we claim, more chivalrous nation,
Britain, we believe, would find it conduce not less to her honour than
to her interests to take such an attitude.</p>

<p> If, however, this is to expect too much of human nature as displayed in the relations between two rival nations, let us at least
rise superior to every temptation to take the United States at a
disadvantage, remembering that there are cases where it is not <hi rend="italic">V&#x153; victis</hi> but <hi rend="italic"> V&#x153;
victoribus</hi>, and where military triumphs are fruitful only in
political, moral, and economical losses to the nation which wins them.
If after the present war is settled, by the reconquest or the
independence of the States which acknowledge Mr. Davis as their chief
the Northern Democracy force an unjust quarrel upon us, we shall see,
as we saw in 1812, a powerful peace party arise among the Americans
themselves whose condemnation of the war will enfeeble its intensity,
curtail its resources, shorten its duration, and neutralise the
resentments it would engender. But such a party will only arise in the
event of our meeting the North in fair single combat. If in such a war
Great Britain were victorious, in the reaction of defeat universal
suffrage would be offered up as a victim to the wounded national pride
of the American people, and with a limited suffrage on the south of
the St. Lawrence we should have reached once more a solid guarantee of
peace. If Great Britain were defeated and obliged to abandon some of
her possessions on the continent, the victors, in the acquisition of
one or more disaffected and anti-American provinces, would soon
discover that they had damaged themselves more than their opponent. If
(what is highly probable) a treaty of peace left neither party
victorious, the bellicose democracy would have learnt once more that a
war on the Canadian frontier "does not pay," and would be little
inclined to re-enact for a fourth time a stale and worn-out
tragedy. Such an international single combat, deplorable as it would
be, might find us better friends at its termination than at its
commencement; and in no case, on whichever side victory inclined,
could it leave behind it that "study of revenge&#x2014;immortal hate," which
would surely be the most fell accompaniment and the most pernicious
legacy of a struggle into which we should allow ourselves to enter as
the virtual ally of those whom the whole people of the loyal States
rightly or wrongly regard as rebels, parricides, and traitors of the
deepest dye.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PROTEST OF THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> following correspondence has passed between the Liverpool Shipowners' Association and the Foreign Office:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">Shipowners' Association, Liverpool, Jan. 13.</p>

<p>My Lord,&#x2014;It has come to the knowledge of the Liverpool Shipowners'
Association, through the public prints, that the Federal Government of
the United States have sunk a stone squadron in the main channel of
Charleston harbour. This proceeding cannot fail seriously and
permanently to injure the entrance to that harbour. The association
fears that, unless strong representations and remonstrances are
promptly made, a similar course may be immediately followed in the
case of the other harbours of the Confederate States. The association
does not think it necessary to dwell at length on the importance of
this question as affecting the general interests of commerce, but
feels called upon, as representing an important interest, to address
your Lordship on the subject. I am, therefore, instructed by the
association respectfully to press this matter on your Lordship's
earnest consideration. I have the honour to be, my Lord, your
Lordship's most obedient humble servant,</p>
<p rend="right"> <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis
A. Clint</hi>, Chairman.</p>

<p>To the Right Hon. Earl Russell, Foreign Office, London.</p>

<p rend="right">Foreign Office, January 15.</p>

<p>Sir,&#x2014;I am directed by Earl Russell to acknowledge the receipt of
the letter which, on behalf of the Liverpool Shipowners' Association,
you addressed to him on the 13th inst., calling his attention to the
course which the Federal Government of the United States have adopted
for closing the main channel of Charleston harbour by sinking there
vessels laden with stone, and expressing the fear of the association
that, unless strong representations and remonstrances are promptly
made, a similar course may be immediately followed in the case of the
other harbours of the Confederate States. I am to request that you
will state to the Liverpool Shipowners' Association that the attention
of her Majesty's Government was at once attracted by the rumours which
obtained currency some weeks ago of such a course as that to which you
refer being contemplated by the Government of the United States, and
on the 20th of December her Majesty's Minister at Washington was
informed of the view taken of it by her Majesty's Government. Lord
Lyons was told that such a cruel plan would seem to imply despair of
the restoration of the Union, the professed object of the war; for it
never could be the wish of the United States' Government to destroy
cities from which their own country was to derive a portion of its
riches and prosperity. Such a plan could only be adopted as a measure
of revenge end of irremediable injury against an enemy. Lord Lyons was
further told that even as a scheme of embittered and sanguinary war
such a measure would not be justifiable. It would be a plot against
the commerce of all maritime nations and against the free intercourse
of the Southern States of America with the civilised world. Lord Lyons
was desired to speak in this sense to Mr. Seward, who, it was hoped,
would disavow the illegal project. Now, however, that the project
seems to have been carried into effect at Charleston, Lord Lyons will
be instructed to make a further representation to Mr. Seward, with a
view to prevent similar acts of destruction in other ports.&#x2014;I am,
Sir, your most obedient servant,</p>

<p>F. A. Clint, Esq.,&amp;c.</p>
 <p rend="right">E.<hi rend="smallcaps"> Hammond.</hi></p>

<p>The subject was discussed at the meeting of the council of the
Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on Monday, when the following
resolution was adopted:&#x2014;" That this chamber views with great
satisfaction the remonstrances made by her Majesty's Government with
regard to the blocking up of Charleston harbour by sinking vessels
laden with stone."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Asia we have news to the 15th ult. The principal points are the removal of Mr. Cameron, the Secretary for War,
and the struggle between the Secretary of the Treasury, Congress, and
the New York bankers in reference to the ways and means.</p>

<p rend="center">THE REMOVAL OF MR. CAMERON.</p>

<p>This act for which the President is solely responsible, is
attributed, like the removal of General Fremont, to two very different
causes&#x2014;first, nepotism and favouritism in the distribution of army
contracts; and, secondly, a radical variance with the President on
the slavery question&#x2014;Mr. Cameron taking the Emancipationist side. That
the latter is the more powerful motive seems to be indicated by
the President's choice of a successor to the vacant post&#x2014;namely,
Edwin Stanton, a Pennsylvanian Democrat and strong
anti-Abolitionist. Mr. Stanton was a member of Mr. Buchanan's Cabinet
after the Secessionists had left it; and the appointment is looked
upon as evincing a desire on the part of Mr. Lincoln to conciliate
the support of the Democrats against the rising influence of the
Abolitionists in Congress and the country. The appointment gives
satisfaction to the army; but the, Senate has not yet confirmed it,
nor that of Mr. Cameron to the post of United States' Minister at
St. Petersburg in lieu of Mr. Cassius Clay, who petitions to be
recalled.</p>
<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>

<p>The important negotiation between the bankers of the three great cities and Mr. Chase has not yet been concluded. The scheme of taxation and loans submitted by the former is unsatisfactory to the
politicians because it is too favourable to the banks.</p>

 <p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The Senate passed the bill compensating the owners of the British
ship Perthshire for her wrongful detention. The bill met with some
opposition from Senator Hale, avowedly based on his anti-English
feeling. The opposition in the Lower House to the bill appropriating
35,000 dollars for enabling the American Commissioners to make proper
arrangements for the transmission and reception of goods at the
world's fair of 1862 was more successful. The occasion was seized by
Mr. Owen Lovejoy, of Illinois, to deliver a philippic against the British Government  and people.</p>

<p rend="center">THE EUROPEAN EXPEDITION TO MEXICO.</p>
<p> A note addressed by Mr. Seward to the British, French, and Spanish
Ministers at Washington has been published. The President authorises Mr. Seward to express his satisfaction at the recognition by the three
Powers of the high interest the United States have in the destiny of
Mexico implied in the invitation extended to him to become a party to
the joint expedition. The President, however, refuses the invitation on the ground, firstly, of the President's desire to maintain the traditional
policy of the United States, which forbids them to make any alliance with foreign Powers; secondly, because Mexico, being a Republican
State, deserves great indulgence from the United States. Inasmuch as Mexico is now shaken by home dissensions, and menaced by a foreign
war, the President is not disposed to seek satisfaction from Mexico at
the present moment.</p>

<p rend="center">MILITARY AND NAVAL.</p>

<p>General Burnside's expedition has sailed from Hampton Roads. No further advance has been made by the Mississippi expedition. General M'Clellan's health is not yet fully re-established. The Duc de Chartres and the Comte de Paris have returned from their furlough and resumed their staff duties in the Federal army.</p>

<p>Work in the New York navy-yards had become slack, the "mortar fleet"
being nearly fitted out. The expedition for which these vessels were
intended was expected to be the last of those about to be undertaken
on the Atlantic seaboard, as the Government agents had ceased to
charter or purchase steamers and sailing-vessels, ferry-boats, canal-
boats, and whatever other variety of naval craft they could obtain.</p>

<p>From Havannah we learn that up to the 8th ult. forty-seven vessels
had run the blockade of the Southern coasts, and arrived in Cuba&#x2014;viz.,
thirty-seven at Havannah, six at Matanzas, and four at Cardenas.</p>

<p rend="center"> THE GOVERNOR OF NEW-YORK ON BRITISH RELATIONS.</p>

<p>Governor Morgan, in his annual message, gives expression to the
enlightened mercantile sentiment on this subject. He says:&#x2014;</p>

<p>A recent occurrence, which created great solicitude both here and
in Europe, renders it not improper for me to say that no State in the
Union has so large an interest as New York in preserving amicable
relations, especially with commercial Powers.</p>

<p>After speaking of the tonnage and value of vessels owned in the
port of New York, which amounted to 1,464,011 tons, and 96,000,000
dols.  respectively, and to the imports from and exports to foreign
countries, which in 1860 were 384,000,000 dols. in value, in addition
to which was the coasting trade, amounting to double, if not quadruple,
these figures, he continues:&#x2014;</p> 
<p>Hostilities with either of the great
Powers of Europe, and, most of all, with that
Government which, from consanguinity, language, and customs is most
intimately related to us, would be of untold disaster. No more pretext, no
caprice of Court or Cabinet, no cause whatever, unless it involved national
dignity or we are denied a positive right, could justify the
representatives of this State in consenting to a war with foreign
Powers, especially at a period when extraordinary supplies of men and
money have been and will continue to be drawn from us to overwhelm the insurgents at home... We should
not weaken ourselves by taking upon us a war of questionable
necessity... Let us give no intended offence, and tamely submit to none.</p>

<p rend="center"> CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>This State has been visited by the severest floods which have ever
occurred since its settlement by the Americans. They were caused by
heavy rains which melted the snow in the mountains, by which the
various streams were rapidly swollen, and rose to a great height. Immense damage has been done to the cities of Sacramento and Marysville, and also to the agricultural settlements in the neighbourhood. At Long Bar, near Marysville, about fifty Chinamen were drowned, and at Sand Flat an entire Chinese settlement was swept
away, the poor fellows climbing into the sycamore-trees only to be torn
away by the rising current. At another bar nearly one hundred
Chinamen were drowned in a narrow gorge, leaving only one to tell
the tale. All the bridges on the rivers of Upper California have been destroyed by the same terrible agency.</p>
<p rend="center">CANADA.</p>
<p>The high tariff in the United States is beginning to have a
favourable effect on Canadian trade. In Montreal large quantities of
cotton goods have been purchased on American account. Most of these will<pb n="105"/>
be smuggled. Cotton goods are now fully thirty per cent dearer on
the American than on the Canadian side of the frontier line. A large
trade is also springing up in teas, sugars, and other articles which
used to be cheaper in the United States than in Canada, but which are
now greatly dearer, on account of the increased duties; and the
smuggling is all reversed. This partially compensates Canada for the
low price of agricultural produce and the stoppage of the sawn lumber
trade, consequent on the cutting off the Southern market.</p></div2>

<p>THE TRENT CASE AND THE BLOCKING-UP OF CHARLESTON
HARBOUR.&#x2014;When Mr. Seward's despatch on the Trent prisoners
arrived in this country, stating various grounds on which they might
have been detained at the very time their release was effected, Earl
Russell stated in reply that, while he cheerfully accepted the result,
he could not acquiesce in his arguments, and added that on a
subsequent occasion he would give his reasons for dissent. That task
he has now executed, and his despatch appears in Tuesday's
<hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi>. The Principles of Mr. Seward from which his Lordship
specially dissents are two&#x2014;namely, that ambassadors or agents, or their
despatches, are to be regarded as contraband of war; and next, that
either persons or goods, of whatever kind, proceeding in a neutral
ship from one neutral point to another are in any case liable to
capture. These principles, he says, are repudiated by all writers on
international law, whether English, American, or Continental. In
conclusion he notices the "singular passage" in Mr Seward's despatch in
which that gentleman says that he would have detained the prisoners if
the safety of the Union required it. "His frankness," says his
Lordship, "'compels me to be equally open, and to inform him that
Great Britain could not have submitted to the perpetration of that
wrong. &#x2014;From a despatch from Lord Lyons to Earl Russell we learn that
Mr. Seward declares that the blocking up of Charleston harbour is only
temporary; that the Federal Government will themselves remove the
obstructions "as soon as the Union is restored;" and that the best
proof of its being incomplete and partial is "that in spite of the
sunken vessels and of the blockading squadron a British steamer laden
with contraband of war had just succeeded in getting in."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 1, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Mason</hi>, the author of the Fugitive
Slave Law, and his co-Commissioner, Mr. Slidell, have arrived in
England; and the Trent drama, which at one time threatened to rise
into the dignity of tragedy, is now over. The actors who performed the
part of prisoners must resume their positions in private life, and
assuredly we have no wreaths to throw them, nor inclination to summon
them before the curtain for what paragraph-makers call an
ovation. Lord Russell has published the despatch in which he
demolished the barley-sugar edifice raised by Mr. Seward. The tone of
the reply is, of course, perfectly courteous; but the arguments are
mercilessly hard. The garbled quotations by Mr. Seward from Emmerich
Vattel, the Neufchatel authority on International Law and the Nature
of Love are restored to the context and to significance; and Lord
Russell reasserts the rule that civilians do not by their presence in
a neutral vessel alter its neutrality, be they who they may, nor do
they expose themselves to capture. To the curious observation of
Mr. Seward that if it had been for the interest of his country to
detain the captives they would have been detained the Earl simply
replies such an idea is indefensible, and that England would not have
permitted such a course. The honour and the justice of this nation
being now vindicated, we presume the matter may drop, unless
Mr. Seward has leisure to compile another miscellaneous column of
fragmentary law. This, however, the clever American lawyer may not
have inclination to do, inasmuch as the sudden and important rupture
in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet may give its remaining members enough of real
business to attend to. Mr. Cameron, the War Secretary, whose views on
the subject of slavery are more in accordance with those of England
than of the North, has been suddenly dismissed by the President, and
his place supplied by Mr. Stanton, who holds by the Domestic
Institution. The measure has excited a great sensation among the
powerful Abolitionist<pb n="109"/> party, and an attempt is being
made to alter public opinion as
to the character of the act by blackening the reputation of
Mr.Cameron&#x2014;a course not new in America, but as to the justice of which
there is at present no evidence before an English journalist. The war
offers no new feature, but it is said that the Confederates have
inflicted a severe blow upon the Federals in an action near Port
Royal, and that the details have been suppressed; but the statement
rests only upon the authority of private letters. Congress, it is more
pleasant to write, has assented to a grant for the purpose of sending
American contributions to our International Exhibition, and was "not
much moved" by a furious anathema pronounced against us by a gentleman
appropriately named Lovejoy, who declared that he hated England, and
would swear all his little Lovejoys to a similar feeling. Evidently
here are some matrimonial alliances in prospective for the descendants
of O'Brien De Brassicis.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The French troops for the Mexican expedition are now embarking, and
the rumours that it is intended to consolidate Mexico into a kingdom
under "an enlightened despotism," representative institutions having
utterly failed to keep adventurers and savages in decent order, are
becoming more and more rife, and go to the extent of even designating
the Archduke Maximilian of Austria as the King of Mexico, England, it
is said, waiving all objections in consideration of the gain to
humanity which the civilisation of Mexico win afford. It may be that
the idea will be received with something less than favour in the
Federal States, but the South lies between Washington and the
Mexicans, and would have no objection to see the precedent of the
establishment of a new dominion-perhaps none to such dominion being a
monarchy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">CAPTURE BY THE CONFEDERATE SHIP SUMTER OF<lb/> TWO
FEDERAL MERCHANT BARQUES OFF GIBRALTAR</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> gentleman to whom we are indebted for the Illustration on the next page writes as follows from Gibraltar, on the 18th ult. respecting the subject of his sketch:&#x2014;"At 7.30 a.m., Jan. 18, the Confederate war-steamer Sumter, Captain Semmes, was seen from the signal-station to capture a large barque flying the Union colours. Having taken
possession of her, she proceeded in chase of another, which in half an hour she also captured. These events occurred about two leagues from the shore. She then gradually drifted further into the Mediterranean; and at 2 p.m. one of the prizes burst into flames, and is now (4p.m.) one sheet of fire from stem to stern. The Sumter is now steering towards Gibraltar."</p>

<p>A letter from Gibraltar, dated Jan. 20, published in the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, gives
the following interesting account of the Sumter's doings in the Mediterranean, and of the condition of the ship and crew:&#x2014;</p>

<p>You will have already heard by telegraph of the arrival of the Sumter in
this bay. On Friday night (the 17th) a message was received here saying that she had left Cadiz, but that her course was not known. As the wind was favourable for the passage of vessels through the Straits to the westward, it was thought not unlikely that she would steam for Gibraltar, with the object of intercepting the many Federal merchantmen homeward bound.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning signal was made from the look-out on the summit of the rock that the Sumter was six miles to the eastward, capturing two large Federal ships. The news, as may be imagined, caused the greatest excitement, and everybody rushed out to catch a glimpse of the privateer and her prey.</p>

<p> The seizure was accomplished easily enough: no defence could be
made. A boat's crew was sent on board, the Federal flag hauled down,
and the thing was done. The cruiser was evidently used to her work. No
time was lost in searching the prizes, the few valuable effects were
removed, the match was lighted, and in another moment the blazing ship
was fast drifting away with the current. When evening closed the
flames were still visible, darting upwards in fitful flashes on the
eastern horizon. The first ship taken was loaded with sulphur,
consigned, as the master endeavoured to make out, to Baring Brothers;
but, as Captain Semmes afterwards remarked, sulphur being the
principal ingredient of gunpowder, and its exportation from England
being just at this time prohibited, it was considered as well to
destroy it, especially as the master had no papers to show. The other
vessel taken, a large barque, proved to be laden with an English cargo; so she was released, and came in here yesterday.</p>

<p>In the evening of Saturday the Sumter anchored in this bay. On Sunday I
went on board, most anxious to see the celebrated craft that has led
the Federal Navy a dance over so many miles of ocean. When going
alongside I could scarcely believe that so poor a vessel could have
escaped so many dangers. She is a screw-steamer, with three masts, a
funnel strangely out of proportion to her size, and a tall, black
hull, so high out of water that she gives you the idea of being
insufficiently ballasted. Four 32-pounders peeped from her sides, and
a large 8-inch pivot-gun was on her main-deck forward. Before she was
fitted for her present work she was a passenger-ship running between
New Orleans and the Havannah. Her unsightly appearance arises from the
alterations that have been made in her decks. In order to afford more
accommodation, and to give more cover for the engines and guns, a
light, temporary flush-deck has been built over what was originally the
only deck of the ship. This raises her an additional ten feet out of
water, and at the same time dwarfs her masts and funnel. She is crank
and leaky. Her engines are partially above the lower-deck, and, with
the object of preserving them from the effects of gunshot, they are
surrounded by a cylindrical casing of 6-inch wood covered with
half-inch bars&#x2014;a very poor protection against an 8-inch shot. Her
officers and crew number ninety in all. The latter are a hardy set of
fellows, ready for any work&#x2014;men who would stick at nothing. They are
of all nations&#x2014;even the Irish brogue was among them. The commander,
Captain Semmes, is a reserved, determined-looking man, whose left hand
knows  not what his right doeth. He received me most courteously, and took me over his ship. </p>

<p>It is stated that the Sumter has been seen in Genoese waters, a few
leagues off the port.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.<hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">On board the Picket, Chesapeake Bay, Jan. 10.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Slidell and Mason affair having been satisfactorily disposed of, and the army of the Potomac still being confined to its lines, I have determined to accompany General Burnside's expedition to some unknown point down in Dixie, and here I am with five others in a cabin six feet nothing listening to the leadsman as he chants in monotonous tones "By the deep seven," feeling inch by inch for the channel through a fog that confines the prospect to a fathom or so of steaming water round the vessel. But before I proceed any further with a description of my voyage I will recur to one or two items connected with my sojourn in Washington, which may be disposed of briefly.</p>

<p>Of course the absorbing topic till within the last twelve days was
the probable ground the American Government would take in reference to
the demand of England for the surrender of Slidell and Mason. When I
last wrote matters bore an exceedingly bellicose appearance, and I for
one looked upon a war between the two countries as not improbable; in
fact so much was I impressed with its possibility that I intimated to
a highly respectable "coloured pussun" who takes in washing_that I
should require my linen home immediately, ready to pack up. However,
"L'homme propose et Dieu dispose" and this time though Jonathan
proposed doing a great deal that, was shocking and terrible to English
ears, he has finished by doing the right thing at last; and so I
suppose we may bury the hatchet and smoke the calumet of peace.</p>

<p>Well, as diplomatic relations had not been broken off between
the Court of St. James's and the White House, I assisted to swell
 the crowd of anything but swells who went to pay their respects to
 the President on New-Year's Day. The diplomatic corps were first in
 making the morning call de rigueur; then followed the officers of the
 army and navy; and the mobility, with whom I was, came last, getting
 but a feeble shake from the exhausted Presidential hand and arm. The
 Sketch that I have forwarded (engraved on page 119) will give your
 readers a notion of the disposition of the scene. The President
 stands close by one of the entrances to the reception-room, having
 next to him the Officer of Public Works, who is placed between
 himself and Mrs. Lincoln; the Secretaries are slightly in the
 rear. The visitors pass directly in front of the Chief of the State,
 and each appears to consider it imperative on him to endeavour to
 squeeze the nails out of the president's fingers, who, by-the-by,
 appears to have a pleasant word for everybody, and especially
 addresses himself to the ladies and children. The whole affair lasts
 about six hours, and during this time every one remains on foot,
 making more tedious and tiring a ceremony that at any time, or under
 any circumstances, must he a disagreeable one. I presume that what I
 saw on the occasion was all right; but it appeared to me that scarcely
 sufficient respect was shown to the Head of the Government by many of
 those who attended the lev&#xE9;e. This idea especially suggested
 itself by the appearance of a considerable portion of the company,
 not so much on account of their fashion of dress as the neglect of
 their persons. Surely tidiness and cleanliness are not opposed to
 republican institutions; and it would have added to the President's
 satisfaction had some of the "bunches of fives" been less incrusted
 with the "free soil of America." The lion of the reception was Judge
 Harney, from the territory of New Mexico, who appeared in a full
 hunting costume of deerskin, attracting everybody's attention by his picturesque ensemble. Indeed, he tells me that no other garments are to be obtained on the plains, and that he adjudicates thus robed, with a rifle on his knee.</p>

 <p>New Year's Day is celebrated with great enthusiasm by the Americans
 generally. The custom which requires the ladies of a family to keep
 open house for all gentlemen who choose to call grew up in New York,
 which city is said to have imported it from Amsterdam, the mother
 city. From New York, as a centre, it was widely diffused over the
 United States, and from private circles it soon spread, in a modified
 form, into public life. In the United States the theory that men in
 official position are the servants of the people is rigidly acted
 upon. Hence it because the fashion for the Mayor of a city to receive
 his "friends" on this day&#x2014;the said friends including every male
 inhabitant of the city. In like manner the Governor of the State was held to
the obligation to "receive" at the State capital. Proceeding one degree higher, the President of the nation falls in with the same ceremony. The President's reception, as before stated, is divided into in parts&#x2014;first, a special reception of the diplomatic corps in the forenoon, and at noon a general reception of the public of both sexes, to enjoy the honour of a shake of the hands with, or a bow from, the chief "public functionary" of the Union, and the highest embodiment of the Sovereignty of the people. But to go back to the starting point.</p>

<p>For some time, as you are aware, there has happened scarcely
anything of importance on the Potomac, and my residence in the
neighbourhood of head-quarters staff has been productive of subjects
of but little interest, with the exception of the fights at Ball's
Bluff, Drainsville, and some odd picket engagements. Now the Burnside
expedition appears to me the only bellicose entertainment at present
on the cards, and its proportions are infinitely greater&#x2014;at least, as
far as I can glean at present&#x2014;than the one which went to Port Royal. I
have reason to suppose its destination is to some important point on
the Southern coast. However, I will not attempt to prognosticate, as
everything at present is kept a profound secret from all but the General
in command and the chief naval officer. Rely on it, you will hear from
me by the first chance I have of sending to you if the Confederates do
not succeed in sinking the ship on which I am on board. At present I
must close; the fog is clearing up, we are entering Hampton Roads, and
this short note has to go on board the return steamer, which is leaving immediately for Baltimore.</p>

<p>A CONFEDERATE COMMISSIONER ON THE SLAVE TRADE.&#x2014;</p>
<p>Mr. Yancey, now in London, as Commissioner from the Confederate
States, writes to the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, contradicting
a statement that he is an advocate of the slave trade. He
says:&#x2014;"I have never advocated the African slave trade. I do not
know two public men in the South of any note who have done so. The
people there are and have been almost unanimously opposed to it. The
State laws, so long in force, prove this, and another striking
fact. There have not been 100 slaves imported into the South from any
quarter for the last fifty-three years. I know of but one small cargo,
and I never heard of another. The slave trade is carried on between
Africa and Cuba alone; Southern men have nothing to do with it. Yankee
captains, Yankee ships, Yankee ship-chandlers, and Yankee capital are
the notorious mainsprings of that trade.  When in the late Federal
Union, in order to gain new senators to resist Yankee taxation, the
South was very desirous of forming new Slave States out of the
territories. But, being now out of that Union, there is no such
motive, and there are slaves amply abundant,with their increase, for
all our wants. No State, no prominent man in the South, wishes to
revive the slave trade. No sooner had the Cotton States seceded than
the Provisional Government established by them adopted the Federal
laws prohibiting the African slave trade. This Constitution has been
submitted for ratification or rejection to the several States
composing the Confederacy, and all&#x2014;thirteen in
number&#x2014;have ratified it. Not a voice has been raised throughout
the entire South against the prohibitory clause. . . . The adherents
of Mr. Lincoln contend that the North was determined to prohibit
slavery in the territories and the South seceded on that account. That
was the immediate cause&#x2014;it was the spark communicated to the
barrel of powder; but it was the powder that did the work and was the
real cause of the disruption. Without, however, going into a
discussion as to the real, and, far deeper, the ulterior causes, let
me show that the North, in its avowed position, cared nothing for the
slave, and only used the slavery question to obtain a political
advantage. Its policy did not propose to free a single slave, but to
keep them as slaves for ever within particular territorial limits. Its
policy was that none of the slaves of the Union should be removed to
certain lands of the Union. The reason for that was, that for every
new State carved out of those territories two senators were added to
the Senate. If the territories could be kept for Yankee emigrants the
new States would send two Northern senators to aid in the system of
legislativerobbery of the products of slave labour&#x2014;not in aid of
legislative abolition of slavery. For this very reason the South, in
 self-defence, finding the North for the first time united as a
 section on that policy, determined no longer to bear the ills of such a
 Government. It will be perceived that the North was not moved by a
 moral but by a political policy, as devoid of honesty as of
 constitutional principle." In conclusion Mr. Yancey says:&#x2014;"My
 mission here is not to ask for an approval of, nor yet to apologise
 for, the laws of the Confederate States and the opinions of their
 people. It is simply to obtain a recognition of those States as a
 Government, whose people are producers of cotton, tobacco, corn, and
 naval stores, and who desire to offer to manufacturing Europe the
 benefits of free trade in the peaceful interchange of those valuable
 products for the woollen, cotton, silk, and hardware fabrics of the
 Old World, unrestricted and untaxed by prohibitory tariffs. In view
 of that great object, any discussion of the internal or domestic laws
 of the Confederate States is irrelevant. Our system of labour is our
 own, injuring no other country, and for which no others are
 responsible to God or to man, and about which we will treat with no
 country."</p></div2>

<p>Colonel Samuel Colt, the inventor of the famous Colt's
revolver, died at Hartford, Connecticut, on the 10th ult., in his forty-eighth
year. It is stated that the wooden model of his pistol was made on
board a vessel while the inventor was on a voyage to Calcutta, in
1829. He received his first patent in 1835, and established a factory
in Paterson, N.J., but met with indifferent success. Colonel Colt
afterwards invented a submarine torpedo which was intended for the
destruction of vessels. He gave two exhibitions of the power of his
new invention in the bay off Castle Garden, by blowing up first a
schooner and afterwards a large brig. He then established a line of
telegraph between New York and Sandy Hook and Montauk, which was
intended to announce the arrival of vessels, and to facilitate the
dispatch of important foreign news; but this enterprise failed, and
Mr. Colt became reduced in circumstances. A year or two later he again got possession of his patent for the revolving pistol, and with the assistance of a few capitalists who joined him a company was formed and a manufactory established at Hartford, which has proved very successful, not only in the making of pistols but in the manufacture of a revolving rifle,
which was also the invention of Mr. Colt. </p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SESSION OF PARLIAMENT</p>
<p>But, whatever else may betide, it is quite certain that grave
questions of international law will arise for discussion. The delicacy
of our relations with the contending States of America will render
necessary the exercise of all the tact and judgment which the
Government have at their command during the ensuing sitting of the
Legislature. There is, we believe, little or no concealment of the
fact that a section of the House of Commons, composed of men of all
parties, will bring the subject of the blockade of the Southern ports,
and even the recognition of the Southern Republic, formally before
Parliament. It is hardly less surely ascertained that our Ministry has
had to resist no ordinary pressure which has been put upon them in
reference to these subjects from a quarter which is not generally
famous for taking a denial; and it is no small tribute to the skill
and temper with which the department of Foreign Affairs is at present
conducted in this country that for the present, at least, the strictly
neutral policy in American affairs which England has adopted has been
triumphant. When, however, a movement which will not bear on the face
of it the stamp of mere party motives becomes prominent in the
Parliament of Great Britain, it would be too much to expect of human
and political nature to suppose that the pressure from abroad will not
be renewed with additional vigour of argument, caught from that which will be assumed to be a phase of public opinion in this country. In such a case, only too probable, it will need the binding up of every faculty of endurance and determination on the part of the Government to resist the force, the constraining power, and the influences brought to bear upon their policy towards America.</p>

<p>Above all things, there should be no dalliance with this question, no hesitancy on their part in their declarations as to the course which they intend to pursue. Already the trade and commerce of England has suffered enough by the disturbed condition of the American States; and in this, the beginning of the year, it would be a crime towards those interests if the attitude of the Government was such as to leave a doubt as to what line they propose to take in this important matter. At present our rulers profess and observe that strict neutrality which in embodied in a phrase of Earl Russell when he said that it was the duty of England to allow every nation to settle
its own internal affairs.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL VICTORY IN KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Zollicoffer, who occupied a strong position
on the north bank of the Cumberland River, in South-eastern Kentucky,
finding that General Thomas, at the head of a Federal division of
15,000 men, was menacing his rear, determined to attempt to drive back
General Schoepf, whose force of 8000 men was intrenched at Somerset, a
little town six miles north of the Cumberland River. On the 18th the
attack took place, and the battle lasted nearly all day. General
Zollicoffer was killed, and his army retreated precipitately to their
intrenchments on Cumberland River. On the following day General Thomas
came up and followed the Confederates to their intrenchments. On
Monday, the 20th, he was preparing to storm them, when he found them
deserted, the enemy having left all their cannon, stores, tents,
horses, and waggons in his hands. Even the steam-boat and nine barges
the fugitives had used to cross the river were found uninjured.  It is
computed that 275 Confederates were killed and wounded, while the
Federal loss is acknowledged to have been heavy, one regiment having
had seventy-five killed and wounded. General Zollicoffer's body is in
the hands of the victors. General Schoepf is a Hungarian refugee, and
when the war broke out was holding the humble position of messenger in
the Patent Office at Washington.</p>

<p rend="center">OTHER MILITARY AND NAVAL NEWS.</p>

<p>The Burnside expedition had made its appearance off the coast of
 North Carolina.</p>

<p>The movement from Cairo was only a reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The army of the Potomac is said to be held in check by the fathomless mud of the Virginia roads. The health of General M'Clellan,
though improved, does not yet enable him to be as active as he could
wish. Very little is said of the sanitary condition of the army by
the journals. The Washington correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Independent</hi>, however, draws a gloomy picture of the camp hospitals:&#x2014;"Complaints are constantly made and rarely listened to by the proper
authorities. The regular hospitals within the district are in an excellent
condition, but the regimental and brigade hospitals in Virginia are in a
shocking state. The Sanitary Commission does not usually extend its care to them. In one of them eighty sick men have lain for weeks without bed, straw, sheet, or pillow. Beds and bedding are generally unknown to these places, and the gifts of the benevolent never reach them. The sick soldiers pass through the most distressing and long-continued fevers in their usual military clothes."</p>
<p>About 1000 prisoners have been exchanged by the two belligerent Governments.</p>
<p>Mass meetings of German citizens had been held in several places, to denounce the treatment received by General Sigel, of Missouri, at the hands of General Halleck. The resolutions denounced the narrow spirit of nativism with which the graduates of West Point were animated towards officers of European birth and education.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The Senate have confirmed the appointments of Mr. Stanton and Mr. Cameron to the posts assigned to them by the President.</p>

<p>The Committee of Ways and Means has reported to the House a
National Currency and Loan Bill, which proposes to make 150,000,000
dol. worth of Treasury notes a legal tender, to be convertible into
Six per Cent Stocks; also to create a Six per Cent Stock of 500,000,000 dollars, which is to be used in payment of the floating debt and for funding the Treasury notes.</p>

<p>A bill to abolish the franking privilege has passed both Houses of

Congress.</p>  

<p rend="center">Mr. SEWARD AND THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p>In his reply thanking Prussia for her advice, Mr. Seward suggests
the propriety of Prussia improving the occasion to recommend the
general policy relative to neutral rights suggested by the American
Government to the European States. He adds that the "periods when the
United States will have occasion to act the part of a belligerent will probably be few and brief."</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Richmond advices report the arrival of the British Steamer Gladiator
at Savannah and the Confederate steamer Vanderbilt at Charleston,
both vessels having run the blockade. The former vessel, which had been waiting at Nassau for some time, was laden with arms, stores, and
clothing.</p>
<p>Ex-President Tyler died at Richmond on the 17th ult. after a very brief illness. Mr. Tyler was elected Vice-President in 1840 by the Whig party, and succeeded to the presidential office on the death of General Harrison, in April, 1841.</p>

<p>A report from New Orleans says that a large meeting of the French
residents was held on the 10th ult., to devise some means of leaving the
Confederate States. A committee was appointed to communicate with
the Federal forces at Ship Island on the subject.</p>

<p rend="center">BRITISH OFFICERS EN ROUTE FOR CANADA.</p>

<p>The British officers who passed through the United States en route for Canada were pleased with the courtesy extended towards them by
- the officials and the people. One of them who went out by the Canada, and arrived at Boston on the 10th ult. writes a follows:&#x2014;</p>
<p>On landing the next morning the English passengers were no less
delighted than surprised to find that the sinister anticipations which
we had entertained of annoyance from the mob were so far from being
realised that we were<pb n="137"/>
received with the utmost politeness and courtesy. The whole of the baggage
was permitted to pass through the Custom House without examination, and in
no single instance was a passport demanded, while, accustomed as I am to the attention and courtesy which a stranger usually receives in an American city, I was most agreeably astonished, so soon after the surrender of the Commissioners, and in the very place of their late imprisonment, to be welcomed with a friendliness and a warmth which left nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>On the journey from Boston to Buffalo by the New York Central
Railway and its connections, the "conversation of the passengers on the
topic of the day confirmed the opinion which I had formed at Boston,
that a great reaction had set in in favour of England."</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The State Legislature, which meets at Sacramento city, had
adjourned to allow the water to subside. The people of San Francisco
had sent aid to the distressed citizens in cooked provisions and
clothing. The American River, on which the city lies, rose at one time
fifty feet. Very heavy rains continued to fall, and it was expected
that the annual gold products of California would be reduced by
millions of dollars. Oregon and Washington Territory had been
similarly visited.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Belligerents in British Ports.</hi>&#x2014;An
important letter has been addressed by Earl Russell to the Lords of
the Admiralty laying down very stringent rules with regard to American
vessels of war or privateers which may enter British ports. No such
vessels will be permitted to enter any port of the Bahama Islands
without special leave of the Lieutenant-Governor; and with reference
to all British ports, whether in the United Kingdom or in the
colonies, the vessels alluded to will not be allowed to obtain any of
the facilities for warlike equipment; and, when a ship belonging to
one belligerent has sailed, twenty-four hours must elapse before a
ship belonging to the other belligerent may also leave the harbour.&#x2014;The
first result of these instructions has been to get rid of the two
visitors who have so long outstaid their welcome in Southampton
waters. The Nashville is off, and the Tuscarora after her. The
Tuscarora put to sea on Saturday, returning to Yarmouth Roads on
Monday morning. Captain Peagram, taking advantage of her return, at
once notified to the Admiralty of his intention to sail, and thus
obtained the twenty-four hours' start of his adversary. The Nashville
steamed out on Monday afternoon, and when last seen she had made the
passage of the Needles, and was "standing away for sea with all sail."
A despatch states that the frigate Shannon had taken up a position
near the Federal ship Tuscarora, with the view of preventing her from
following the Nashville before the expiry of the twenty-four hours
prescribed. Captain Peagram and his officers seem to have kept their
secret well, nothing whatever being known as to the destination of the
Nashville. A large steamer has been seen off Cape Clear. She showed
neither colours nor name, but from her general appearance and
movements she was suspected to be either a Federal or a Confederate
war-vessel.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 8, 1862</p>
<p>...Meantime we may record that in the fortunes of the American War
there appears to have been, for the first time, a change in favour of
the North. An engagement has taken place in Somerset County, in the
State of Kentucky, where the Confederates, with a comparatively small
force, made a dash to break the line which the Northern Generals seem
to be seeking to draw around their antagonists. The fight was
protracted, and, as usual, the numbers of the slain are in curiously
small proportion to that of the combatants and of the hours during
which the struggle is said to have "raged." But at length the death of
the Southern General and a decided movement by the overpowering force
of the North turned the day, and the Confederates fled, leaving their
slain and many of their wounded. The Commander-in-Chief has had other
foes to deal with, and has actually been compelled to submit to an
examination before a Congress Committee as to his plans of the
campaign. It is satisfactory to learn that the intelligent civilians
who sat in judgment on General M'Clellan were pleased to admit that he
seemed to know what he was about, and certified to the people that
there was no cause at present for interfering with the young
Napoleon.... Certain of the organs of the South write in rather a despairing way as to the condition of its army; but there is no sign of compromise, and no doubt the strongest efforts will be made to hold out until it can be ascertained whether France and England, or either, will interpose by mediation or by an infraction of the blockade.</p>

<p>A semi-ministerial admission that the three Powers-&#x2014;England, France,
and Austria&#x2014;disbelieve in the fitness of Mexico for self-government,
and that two of them will take an active part in the establishment of
a monarchy under an Austrian Archduke, has occasioned considerable
"sensation ;" but as the topic must receive ample consideration in
both Houses of Parliament it may be well to delay judgment upon this
new and bold measure. Were the Northern States at peace, we imagine that so unceremonious a disregard of the Monroe doctrine would rouse a storm which under existing circumstances it may be convenient to postpone. </p></div2>

<p rend="center">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p> The Imperial Parliament was opened on Thursday afternoon by Royal Commission....</p>

<p rend="center">THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.</p>

<p> <hi rend="smallcaps">My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi></p>
<p>We are commanded by her Majesty to assure you that her Majesty is
persuaded that you will deeply participate in the affliction by which her
Majesty has been overwhelmed by the calamitous, untimely, and irreparable
loss of her beloved consort, who has been her comfort and support.</p>

<p>It has been, however, soothing to her Majesty, while suffering most acutely under this awful dispensation of Providence, to receive from all classes of her subjects the most cordial assurances of their sympathy with her sorrow, as well as of their appreciation of the noble character of him the greatness of whose loss to her Majesty and to the nation is so justly and so universally felt and lamented.</p>

<p>We are commanded by her Majesty to assure you that she recurs with
confidence to your assistance and advice.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's relations with all the European Powers continue to be friendly and satisfactory; and her Majesty trusts there is no reason to apprehend any disturbance of the peace of Europe.</p>

<p>A question of great Importance, and which might have led to very serious consequences, arose between her Majesty and the Government of the United States of North America, owing to the seizure and forcible removal of four passengers from on board a British mail-packet by the commander of a ship of war of the United States; but that question has been satisfactorily settled by the restoration of the passengers to British protection and by the <sic>disavowably</sic> the United States' Government of the act of violence committed by their naval officer.</p>

 <p>The friendly relations between her Majesty and the President of the United
States have therefore remained unimpaired.</p>

<p>Her Majesty warmly appreciates the loyalty and patriotic spirit
which have been manifested on this occasion by her North American
subjects.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.&#x2014;<hi rend="smallcaps">THURSDAY</hi>.</p>     
<p rend="center">HER MAJESTY'S SPEECH.&#x2014;THE ADDRESS.</p>

<p>&gt;The Royal Speech having been read by the Lord Chancellor and again by the clerk at the table,</p>

<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Dufferin</hi> moved an Address in reply,
which, as usual, was a mere echo of the Speech from the
Throne.... Adverting to America, he pointed out the ties of Interest and
parentage which bound us to the United States, and
expressed his approval of the neutral attitude the Government had
assumed from the very outbreak of the civil war now desolating that country. He regarded the disputes which had arisen between the Northern and Southern States as the result of an incompatibility of temper; but, at the same time, he held that her Majesty's Government, in the wise precautions they had taken to protect the vast commercial interests of the nation and to maintain unimpaired the prestige of our naval prowess, had received the full sympathies of every British subject. Amid loud cheers from all sides of the House, he briefly adverted to the patriotism and determined spirit which had been manifested by Canada when a war with the United States appeared even more than imminent. In conclusion, he expressed a hope that the course her Majesty's Government had taken, in conjunction with France and Spain, in reference to the state of Mexico, would result in the establishment of order and the resumption of commercial tranquillity....</p>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Shelburne</hi> briefly seconded the Address.</p>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> concurred with the mover
and seconder of the Address in the tribute they had paid to the memory
of Prince Albert; and said he felt that the peculiar circumstances under which they had met rendered it most desirable that there should be no unnecessary differences of opinion. With regard to the American difficulty, he was bound to admit that her Majesty's Government had no alternative in the course they had taken. The moment they found that the act of Captain Wilks was not sanctioned by international law, a grave, serious, and imperative duty devolved upon them from which they could not shrink. However great might be the horrors of war, far greater must be the ignominy of forfeiting the honour of the country. He deeply regretted the course which the Federal Government had taken, because, although they had assented to the just demands of this country, they had done so with a very ill grace, though feeling that they were in the wrong, and had placed themselves, their Government, and their people in a position of undeserved humiliation. They had yielded not to their own sense of justice but to a demand by force, because they knew that this country would be satisfied with no less. Yet, though he approved the course the Government had taken in reference to the American difficulty, he thought they ought to be cautious how they entered upon negotiations which had for their object an alteration in the principles upon which international law was now regulated....</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi> expressed his satisfaction at the course which Lord Derby
had taken, and said that throughout the whole of the differences with the
American Government her Majesty's Government had entertained but one
desire, and that was the preservation of the neutrality of the country, so far
as the internecine disputes with America were concerned, but not at
the cost of dishonour to the British name. The moment the outrages
upon the Trent occurred the Government felt that they had but one
duty to perform, and that was instant and satisfactory reparation; and
it afforded him the utmost pleasure to find that in the course they
had taken they had been unanimously supported by the feelings of the country....Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> stated that all the papers which related to the American
difficulty and to the affairs of Mexico should at an early day be laid
before Parliament. He expressed his satisfaction at the manner in
which the efforts of the Government to maintain the honour of the
British flag had been supported by the country, and drew a contrast
between the unanimity which prevailed on the present occasion with
what had been the course adopted in former times when, whatever might
be the proposition which might be submitted by the Ministers, it would
be sure to meet with the dissent of the Opposition. Adverting to the
present position of American affairs, he stated that there could be no
doubt, from the rapid success which had attended the efforts of the
Confederates to break the blockade, that it was of a most ineffectual
character, but at the same time the Government had no desire to press
hardly on the Northern States, but hoped that they would be able
themselves to settle their difficulties with the Southerners. Whether
this struggle ended in the total disruption or in more firmly
cementing the Union, her Majesty's Government would feel that they had
done their duty to both sides by preserving a strict neutrality.</p>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS&#x2014;THURSDAY.</p>

<p rend="center"> HER MAJESTY'S SPEECH.-THE ADDRESS.</p>

<p>The Speaker having read her Majesty's most gracious speech,</p>

<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Portman,</hi> who was received with cheers, rose to move that an humble
Address be presented to her Majesty in answer to her most gracious Speech....</p>

<p>He remarked that there was one question of deep importance which
might have led to serious consequences, and that was the differences
which had arisen between this country and the United States. The
pacific conclusion of the question was, he believed, due to the prompt
and vigorous measures which had been taken by her Majesty's
Government. The insult was one which no nation could have allowed to
pass unatoned for. It was a breach of international law and an insult
to the British flag. But the course taken by her Majesty's Government
was the one that was best calculated to maintain peace and to assert
the dignity of this country. It was gratifying to find that the tone
adopted by her Majesty's Government had been followed by the 
Government of the United States. He did not wish to say anything
invidious or irritating on this subject, but he might be permitted to
remark that the attitudes of the two peoples were essentially
different&#x2014;that, whilst great numbers of the citizens of the United
States were desirous of pushing matters to extremity, the people of
this country desired, in the first instance, to ascertain the rights
of the case, and, having once done so, they evinced a stern
determination to demand reparation, and, if necessary, to enforce that
reparation. Happily, the difficulty had been settled without entering
into a war, and he was sure that the course which had been pursued by
her Majesty's Government had received the full approval of the large
majority of the nation. One of the principal results which had
followed the manifestation of feeling in the United States had been
the display of loyalty evinced by her Majesty's subjects in British
North America, showing that they could appreciate the wise and liberal
form of government under which they lived and under which they enjoyed
the fullest civil and religious liberty. This country had received
from our ally the Emperor of the French a proof of friendship by the
readiness with which he had expressed his concurrent opinion on this
matter; and he believed that the prompt and unhesitating expression of
that opinion had gone far towards the solution of the difficult
question. It was gratifying to find that during this painful struggle
we had preserved tho strictest economy; and, although he regretted the
suffering and distress which existed amongst the manufacturing
population, he believed the exigencies of the case would only give an
additional impetus to British energy and be the means of opening new
fields whence a sufficient supply of cotton could be derived. There
was another result on which he might congratulate the House, and more
particularly hon. gentlemen opposite, and that was the success which
had attended the organisation of our naval reserve....</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> expressed his conviction that
the information contained  in the Speech from the Throne, both upon
our domestic affairs and foreign relations, must be regarded with
satisfaction by the House at large. In the threatening aspect of
American affairs he most cordially recognized the propriety of the
course taken by her Majesty's Government in preserving a strict
neutrality; and he was proud of the dignified and honourable attitude
taken by her Majesty's Government towards the Northern States in the
late difficulty, while he admitted that the American Government had,
all things considered, met the question at issue in a fair and
honorable manner. With regard to the dispute between the Northern and
Southern States, he thought all that the former had a right to demand
of this country was that we should not recognise the independence of
the latter prematurely and without due consideration. Taken in
connection with the interposition in the affairs of Mexico, he
considered this part of the question to be of the greatest
importance, and he called upon the Government to lay before the House
all the information in their possession on the subject of the blockade. He
regarded the announcement made by the Government of their part in the
Mexican intervention with very great anxiety, for this country was the
first to recognise the independence of Mexico when she rebelled
against Spain; and, although it had at first been stated that the
grounds of interference were the insecurity of property and the
non-settlement of British claims, much more extensive reasons had since been assigned....</p>

<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> could not permit some of
the remarks made by the right hon. gentleman to pass unnoticed. With
regard to the dispute between the American States, the noble Earl at
the head of the Foreign Office had shown a discretion, a temper, and a
dignity which must be gratifying to the country&#x2014;equal to the
occasion, and not exceeding it. From the outset of the dispute her
Majesty's Government had preserved a strict neutrality, and from that
strict neutrality it was not their intention to depart. They regretted
the commercial and manufacturing distress to which the unhappy state
of affairs had given rise in England; but they were not prepared,
because of that distress, to depart from the course of conduct which
they had hitherto pursued. With regard to the Mexican intervention, her
Majesty's Government had no other motive of action than that which had
been openly assigned, and were no party to any design of changing the
form of government and imposing upon the Mexican people a form of
government which might not be acceptable to them.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ALLIED INTERVENTION IN MEXICO.</p>
<p>...But, with that audacity which seems to be the common
characteristic of Transatlantic Republics, Mexican Governments of
every party have been foremost in pillaging, insulting, threatening,
and even taking the lives of foreign residents. No international
obligations have been allowed to stand in the way of the President for
the time being, or of his creatures. Europeans have been mercilessly
fleeced, as such, by forced loans. Consuls have been ill-treated, and
their national archives ransacked. Promises have been made but to be
broken. Solemn stipulations have been recklessly violated, and at
length, under the seeming connivance of the party in power, the design
was openly entertained of ridding the country of all foreign
residents, and, of course, of confiscating and appropriating all their
property within reach. Several causes contributed to indispose the
leading European Powers to call Mexico to account. The extreme
jealousy of the United States of any interference with the affairs of
the New by the Powers of the Old World&#x2014;the mutual distrust by the
latter of each other's ultimate designs&#x2014;the fear lest some
complication of practical policy in the Western Hemisphere might
eventuate in hostilities in the Eastern, and the expense of reducing
Mexican anarchy, prevailed to lengthen out the patient endurance of
European Governments. Outrage became at last intolerable, at least in
the judgment of the allies, and, after considerable negotiation,
England, France, and Spain agreed to a convention by which they
pledged themselves to united action for the purpose of wringing
satisfaction and redress from the lawless Republic.</p>

<p>Any one of the allied Powers could have reduced Mexico to reason with
the utmost ease; but it seems to have been thought that any one of
them operating singly might turn success to a selfish account. The
convention, therefore, must be regarded as a document intended to
impose restraint upon the assailants, and not made necessary by the
strength of the assailed. Each of the contracting Governments
renounces all intention of permanent conquest, and the redress that
they seek they engage to seek in common, and not separately, or at
each other's expense. Spain has been somewhat suspiciously eager for
the fray. Her forces were first on the scene of action, and the port
of Vera Cruz and the fortress of San Juan d'Ulloa are already in the
occupation of the allies. Mexican Generals, however, although capable
of surrendering strongholds without a blow, are equally capable of
offering a show of desperate resistance where it is plainly of no
avail. The latest intelligence prepares us to expect that intestine
feuds will be momentarily buried, and exhausted Mexico will defy the
arms of the three allied Powers. So affairs stood when information from that quarter was last dispatched.</p>

<p> Meanwhile, however, a novel aspect of the case has turned up for
 discussion. The design seems to have been somewhere entertained of
 putting an end to Mexican confusion by converting the Republic into a
 Monarchy, and placing the Archduke Maximilian, of the house of
 Austria, on the throne. Happily, as we think, the conditions laid
 down by this illustrious scion of an Imperial house as indispensable
 to his acceptance of the honour are such as will be found
 impracticable. Not that we regard Monarchy as an institution wholly
 unsuited to Mexico, especially in her present state, nor that we
 associate with the Austrian Archduke all the faithlessness which has
 characterised the family of which he is a member. Had the project
 originated in Mexico, or received the undoubted sanction of the
 nation, we can well believe that it might have eventuated in a
 permanent settlement of Mexican affairs, and a rapid development of
 the unbounded resources of that splendid territory. But for any such
 arrangement to have been the outcome of European intrigue, aiming at
 not so much what is thought best for Mexico, but what may be most
 convenient for European diplomacy, would be fatal to its
 success. Royalty forced upon the people of Mexico might possibly
 overawe them, but would not engage their hearty allegiance; and one
 can easily imagine what would be the inevitable fate of the new
 kingdom in the course of a few years, whether the Confederate States
 of America establish their independence or whether the United States
 be again restored to an unbroken Federation. Mexican institutions
 must represent Mexican sentiments, or the country will inevitably and
 speedily be absorbed by her powerful and anti-monarchic neighbour.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the North American we have telegrams from New
York to the 1st inst.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>This expedition, consisting of 125 vessels of all classes, started
from Hampton Roads, in Chesapeake Bay, on the 11th and 12th
ult. Encountering heavy fogs and severe storms, they did not arrive at
Hatteras until the 15th. The screw-steamer New York ran on the bar at
the entrance to the harbour and soon became a total wreck. All hands
were saved; but her cargo, consisting of 200,000 dols. worth of
powder, rifles, and bombs, was totally lost. The gun-boat Zouave and
the steamer Pocahontas were also wrecked near the lighthouse. Ninety
valuable horses belonging to the Rhode Island Battery had to be thrown overboard. Several tow-boats, and schooners laden with provisions, were wrecked. No lives were lost except those of the colonel and surgeon of a New Jersey regiment and a mate, through the swamping of a life-boat. Up to the 26th ult. General Burnside had made no advance beyond Hatteras Bar. The precise object of the expedition still remains undisclosed to the public.</p>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL VICTORY IN SOUTHERN KENTUCKY.</p>

<p>General Thomas's official report of the battle at Mill Spring has
been published. The affair was as decisive as the first reports
represented it to be. A war correspondent thus describes the manner in
which the Confederate General Zollicoffer met his death:&#x2014;</p>
<p>At the point of the V died General Z. He fell nearer our camp than
any other man of his army. He was with Battle's regiment, his own home friends,
born and brought up around him at Nashville. A short distance from him,
to his right, a party of his men had been broken from their comrades and
were herding together like frightened deer. Colonel Fry's men (loyal
Kentuckians) were just about to fire on them. Colonel Fry himself was
at the right of his regiment, at the point of greatest danger. General
Zollicoffer was on foot, and within a few feet of the
Colonel. A gunboat concealed his uniform. Seeing the condition of his
men, as the Colonel rode up, General Z. said, "Colonel, you would not
fire upon your friends, would you?" Colonel F. supposed from the
General's manner and remark that he was one of our 
own officers, and at once replied, "Certainly not, Sir; I have no such
intention." He turned and rode a few steps, when one of the General's aides fired
at him, wounding his horse. Believing that he was tricked, Colonel Fry at
once wheeled and fired at the General with his revolver. The latter
raised his hand to his breast and fell dead.</p>

<p rend="center">OTHER BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The Federals have taken possession of Cedar Keys, a small group of 
islands on the west coast of Florida, and the western terminus of the railroad across the isthmus to Fernandina.</p>

<p>Six vessels have been sunk in Moffat's Channel, Charleston. Eight
more will be sunk immediately. This channel was left open when the
main channel was stopped up.</p>

<p>A Confederate ship of war, the Calhoun, while on her way from Havannah
to Charleston, being chased by a Federal ship of war, was  abandoned and burnt.
Mr. Reynolds, the Federal agent at Port Royal, had returned to
Washington. He reported that he had gathered about 1,000,000 dols.
worth of cotton, and that 3000 negroes were regularly employed in gathering it.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Bishop Amos, of Ohio, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and the Hon.
Hamilton Fish, of New York, have been appointed Commissioners
to the Confederate States for the purpose of relieving the necessities of
Federal prisoners there.</p>

<p>The Congressional Committee appointed to report upon the gun-boat contracts made by the brother-in-law of the Secretary of the Navy had condemned the system. The House Committee on the district of Columbia have decided to report adversely to the proposition to abolish slavery in the district. The House has also refused to <sic>taken</sic> any steps towards the recognition of the Republic of Hayti.</p>

<p>General Goicuria had arrived at Washington on a mission from the
Mexican Government.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>
<p>The remains of the late Mr. Tyler lay in state in the capitol at
Richmond, and were honoured with a public funeral. He was nearly
seventy-two years of age at the time of his decease. There are now four living ex-Presidents of the United States&#x2014;namely, Van Buren, Fillmore, Pierce, and Buchanan.</p>  

<p>General Beauregard, with 15,000 men, has left Eastern Virginia for
Kentucky, in order to make head against the Federals there, President
Jefferson Davis will command at Manassas.</p>
<p rend="center"> UTAH.</p>
<p>This Mormonite territory demands admission into the Union. Delegates
assembled at Salt Lake City on Jan. 22 and drew up a State
Constitution to be submitted to Congress.It is not probable that their
petition will be granted, as in the eyes of the dominant party of the
United States "polygamy and slavery are twin-relics of
barbarism."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 15, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> proceedings in Parliament have as yet had little of interest. The orations on the opening evening were chiefly addressed to the one melancholy topic with a reference to which the Royal Speech began....</p>

<p>America, of course, came in for a share in the opening discussions. The Opposition heartily approved of all that the
Government has done, and Lord Derby took pains twice to
correct a report that made him express a belief that we should soon have to recognise the Southern Confederacy. Mr. Disraeli spoke more favourably than his chief in regard to the Government of the Northern States, and said that they had dealt manfully with the great difficulty presented by the secession; and he therefore thought that any communication from Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet should be received in a generous spirit. The prudent reticence which characterised both Houses last Session as regarded American affairs is likely to be imitated, although in the Lords more than one nobleman has expressed himself strongly upon the conduct of the Lincoln Government towards England, and although an endeavour will be made to fix Lord Palmerston to some definite expression of opinion on the sufficiency of the blockade....</p>

<p>We do not learn much from the latest mails from New York touching the last battle; but it is clear that the Confederates
were worsted, and fled with considerable energy, but not until
after a fierce struggle of many hours. The battle must have been a desultory one, as is clear from the small number of the slain and also from the mode in which General Zollicoffer was killed, he and his friends having been riding about the field apparently with no express object, and having come upon another
small body of wanderers on the other side. Each body took the other
for friends until very near, and then a hand-to-hand fight ensued, and
the General was brought down by a shot from a revolver. All this looks
remarkably unlike an incident in a real battle, and indicates a sort
of guerrilla warfare. But the result was certainly unfavourable to the
South, and the victory is made the most of in New York. On the other
hand, the expedition along the coast met with an unfortunate check. A
vessel loaded with valuable munitions of war went on a rock and sunk;
and, though but few lives were lost, the ready lies of the telegraphic
correspondents magnified the affair so awfully that General M'Clellan
thought right to order the journals to call in the sheets in which
they had given the false intelligence. This they could not do, but
spread, in the contrary interest, the news that Government was
repressing intelligence, and by this means a panic was created. The
truth came out at last&#x2014;the casualty was a severe one, but was merely
one of the accidents of war which are supposed to be included in the
calculations of every prudent General. Up to the present time,
therefore, the ninety days which were to end the campaign were melting
away without any remarkable advance towards the desired
object.</p></div2>

been torn open, and that he had been pressed to renounce his

order to facilitate his liberation.&#x2014;Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> was understood to say that, in the
explanation furnished by Mr. Seward, Mr. Shepherd was considered a
citizen of the United States. He had been arrested on suspicion of
being a spy, and the American law, as interpreted by its law officers,
gave to the President in times of emergency the power of arrest. There
was no objection to lay the correspondence on the table.&#x2014;The Earl of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Carnarvon</hi> was surprised to hear that the report was correct; and he hoped that when the correspondence was produced it would appear that the Government had not only remonstrated against the injustice,

before Parliament, and from that it would appear that the Federal
Government alleged that these persons had been engaged in treasonable
conspiracies, and, the President having exercised his legitimate right
in suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, he was not prepared to say that
the detention of those persons was illegal, or demanded more decided
Interference on the part of her Majesty's Government.&#x2014;The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> stated that he would be glad to know if

published yesterday week. The first consists of correspondence
relating to the civil war in America, chiefly between Lord Lyons and
Lord Russell. This correspondence goes back as far as Nov. 17, 1860,
when the primary elections in the United States had
assured the elevation of Mr. Lincoln to the presidential chair. All
the momentous events which have occurred in the interval are narrated
and discussed. There is a long letter addressed to Lord Russell by
Messrs. Yancey, Rost, and Manns, urging that the Confederate States
were entitled to be regarded as a Government de facto; and there are
other proofs of the activity of those gentlemen. No. 2 is a reprint of
the American Bluebook containing all the diplomatic correspondence
between Mr. Seward and the representatives of America at foreign

law which has been raised by the Transatlantic struggle. The fourth

containing "Plans of the United States' Harbours," showing the

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the City of Washington we have advices from New York to the
8th inst. The only military operation of the week is the</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Capture of Fort Henry.</hi></p>
<p>This Confederate fort is situated on the Tennessee River, in Western
Kentucky, not far from its mouth. On the 6th seven Federal gun-boats, under the command of Commodore Foote, attacked the fort,
and, after one hour and a quarter's bombardment, the Confederate
General Tilgheim and the garrison of sixty men surrendered unconditionally. The fort contained twenty guns, and offered a
strong resistance. The boiler of the gun-boat Essex exploded, killing
thirty Federals. The Federal land forces did not arrive until after
the surrender. Fort Dennellson, on the Cumberland River, will be the
next point of attack.</p>

<p>The Burnside expedition has sailed for Roanoke Island.</p>
<p rend="center">FINANCE.</p>

<p>The anxieties of the Secretary of the Treasury have been relieved by the passage of the Treasury Note Bill through the House of Representatives, with the clause making the notes a legal tender, by a large majority. The telegrams to the contrary were erroneous. The House of Representatives has added an amendment making the payment of interest on Government Bonds optional in coin or paper.</p>

<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has unanimously passed resolutions to
sustain the Government in giving currency to the legal tender notes
until they can be placed on a specie basis by the imposition of taxes
adequate to their redemption. On the other hand, the people show no
revived disposition to invest in the National Loan, of which nearly
50,000,000 dols. remain on the hands of the Government. Gold is
3&#xBD; prem.; the 7.30 Treasury notes are selling at a discount of
l&#xBD; per cent; and the contractors are clamoring for payment. The Federal and State Treasuries, however, are most anxious to keep faith with the public creditor, and have paid the interest on the several National and State debts in coin. It is stated on high authority that the amount of the funded Federal debt was on the 15th of January 306,700,000 dols., having risen to thin amount-from 65,000,000 dols. since Mr. Lincoln's inauguration. This is irrespective of a large and daily- augmenting floating debt. The same authority estimates that by the end of this fiscal year (June 30) the funded and floating debt will amount to 650,000,000 dols.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>In the Senate, on the 31st ult., the resolution appropriating
35,000 dols. to forward the interests of American exhibitors at the
International Exhibition was rejected by the vote of&#x2014;Ayes, 17;
Nays, 22. A bill to prohibit Americans engaging in the coolie trade passed the Senate. Mr. Bright, senator from Indiana, has been expelled from the United States' Senate for corresponding in the spring of last year with Mr. Jefferson Davis on the subject of gunpowder.</p>

<p> The House Committee on Commerce has reported on the Reciprocity
Treaty with Canada. The report deprecates the abrogation of the treaty, but advocates its amendment, with a view to benefit American industry. It affirms that while Canada draws from American imports a revenue of 1,000,000 dols., the United States only derives 25,000 dols. from duties on Canadian imports.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ADMINISTRATION.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has at length yielded to outside pressure and
ordered the removal of the captured privateersmen from a common gaol
to Fort Lafayette, where they are to be treated as ordinary prisoners
of war. A flag of truce from General Johnston, of the Confederate
Army, with despatches for the President
had been received. It is supposed that it relates to the exchange of prisoners.</p>

<p>The President has granted a respite of three weeks to Captain Gordon, of the slaver Erie, who was to have been hung on the 7th inst. Judge Cowles has written a letter to the President begging him to commute the sentence of death.</p>

<p>The Maine Senate having requested the Governor of that State to
demand explanations of Mr. Seward for his offer to pass British troops
across that state, the Secretary of State replies, in a long letter,
that the immediate grounds of the proceeding were the saving the
persons concerned from risk and suffering which might be feared if
they were left to make their way, in an inclement season, through the
ice and snow of a northerly Canadian voyage. It was a customary act of
comity such as the United States' Government receives from New Grenada
whenever it passes troops across the isthmus:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>The United States have not only
studiously practised the most perfect
justice in their intercourse with Great Britain, but they have also
cultivated on their part a spirit of friendship towards her as a
kindred nation, bound by the peculiar ties of commerce. The Grand
Trunk Railroad, a British highway, extended through the territories of
the United States to perhaps the finest seaport of our country is a monument of their friendly disposition. The reciprocity treaty, favouring the productions of British North America in the markets of the United States, is a similar monument of the same wise and benevolent policy. I shall not affect ignorance of the fact that popular asperities have recently appeared in that portion of the British Empire, as well as in the British Islands, which have seemed to indicate a growing alienation of sentiment among portions of the British people. But the Government of Great Britain has nevertheless, during all this time, held towards us its customary language of respect and friendship. This Government, practising entire frankness, yields its full faith to these assurances. The popular asperities to which I have alluded are believed to have had their origin in accidents and misapprehensions of a temporary character. While the policy of this Government has been to fortify its territories so as to be able to resist all foreign as well as domestic enemies, if such enemies must come, it has been equally careful at the same time to secure even greater strength by showing itself consistent in all things, scrupulously just, and, if possible, magnanimous towards all other nations.</p></q>

 <p>If, however, Mr. Seward concludes, the State of Maine feels herself
aggrieved, the orders will be cheerfully modified.</p>

<p rend="center">CONFEDERATE REPORT ON BULL RUN.</p>

<p>General Beauregard's official report on the battle of Bull Run has
been published. The loss of the Confederates was 1800 killed and
wounded. The effective Confederate force engaged was 21,000 men
and twenty-nine guns. The report concludes as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is doubtless expected that through this report my countrymen should be made acquainted with some of the sufficient causes that prevented the advance of our forces and prolonged vigorous pursuit of the enemy to and beyond the Potomac. The War Department has been fully advised long since of all those canoes, some of which only are proper to be here communicated. An army which had fought like ours on that day against uncommon odds, under a July eon, most of the time without water and without food, except a hastily snatched meal at dawn, was not in the condition for the toil of an eager, effective pursuit of an enemy immediately after the battle. On the following day an unusually heavy and unintermitting fall of rain intervened to obstruct our advance. Added to this, the want of a sufficient cavalry force made an effective pursuit a military impossibility.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Mr. W. H. Russell, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent, has quitted the United
States for the purpose of making a tour of inspection in Canada.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the assurances from Washington correspondents
that the Federal Government has perfect faith in the friendly assurances
offered to it by the leading Governments of Western Europe, the New York press obstinately persist in representing that an intervention by France and Great Britain will take place on or before the 1st of April next.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan has forbidden the Hutchinsons to sing their anti-slavery songs in camp and has ordered them back to Washington.</p>

<p>The Legislature of Michigan has sent a petition to Congress stating that as slavery is the cause of the war it should be swept from the land.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Anti-slavery Society have held their annual
meeting without any of the usual disturbances.</p>

<p>During the week 173 bales of Government Sea Island cotton have
been sold at from 28c. to 71c. per pound, the average price being 55c.
Nine bales of Uplands were sold at 25c. to 26&#xBD;c.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>Owing to the continuance of the floods, the Legislature of this State have adjourned from Sacramento City to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Arrangements have been made to send telegrams direct from
Halifax, Nova Scotia, to San Francisco. </p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 22, 1862.</p>
<p>...Public opinion in the Northern States appears to be calling
peremptorily for action on the part of the military authorities; and
journals which are usually well-disposed towards the Government do not
scruple to declare that unless something be done towards the
subjugation of the South it will be difficult to protest much longer
against the interference of other nations. The call seems to be heard,
and a simultaneous movement of three forces, intended to clear
Kentucky of the Southern troops, is announced. Again, we are told that
another fortnight will bring us great news. Mr. Jefferson Davis was to
be inaugurated as First President of the South on this day (the 22nd),
and has selected the especial sacred volume on which "his lips shall
be pressed" in ratification of his vow to protect the system of
man-stealing and man-selling. The great consideration with the North
is, of course, money; and, provided this can be found, it is most
probable that the long and magnificent preparations made by General
M'Clellan will enable him to strike an important blow, one which will
satisfy the honour of the North and permit Mr. Lincoln to listen to
terms of compromise. A strange rumour is, however, promulgated, to the
effect that the President and his War Secretary design to take the
responsibility of commanding the advancing army, while General
M'Clellan will be left to act upon the Potomac. We mention this
because it is gravely asserted in several journals, but the statement
does not seem very truthful.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Seizure of the Trent.</hi>-On the motion
for going into Committee of Supply on the Supplemental Estimates (Army
and Navy), Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright</hi>, in a speech of some
length, adverted to the affair of the Trent. He expressed his approval
of the tone adopted by Lord Russell in the despatches which he had
addressed to the British Minister at Washington, but entirely
dissented from the policy of warlike preparation, the cost of which
the country was now required to defray. He defended the American
Government from the imputation of being under the influence of a mob,
showed how the menaces which had been indulged in had paralysed trade
even to its farthest ramifications, and asserted that the real
interests of this country and the progress of human freedom were bound
up with the cause of the Federal States.&#x2014;Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Baxter</hi>, while approving of the preparations made
by the Government, urged that the North American colonies, whose
wealth and public spirit had been made conspicuous by recent events,
should pay the expense of their own military establishments.&#x2014;Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> defended the Government from the
imputations of Mr. Bright. The policy which her Majesty's Government
had pursued in reference to the affair of the Trent had met with the
general approval of the country, because it was obvious that no other
course could have been adopted to assert the honour and independence
of the country. If the American Government really felt that they were
bound by their own principles of international law to give up the
Confederate Commissioners, why did they wait for a remonstrance from
England, and why had they kept them for several weeks in prison? Her
Majesty's Government had no information to lead them to believe that
the prisoners who had been taken out of the Trent would have been given up. On
the contrary, they were bound to arrive at an opposite conclusion, for
Captain Wilks had been converted into a hero, and his act had been
applauded at a public banquet, and had been commended by the House of
Representatives and the Department of the Admiralty. So far from her
Majesty's Government  having incurred the censure of the House or the
country, he submitted that
they would have deserved the displeasure of both if they had simply
rested their case upon a demand and had taken no steps to extort
redress by the usual means. The Government had done what they
conceived to be their duty, and, although they had done no more than
their duty, they believed they had given expression to the feelings of
the country at a moment of no ordinary difficulty.</p>

demanded.&#x2014;Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> in reply, said that
Mr. Shaver had made no application to him for compensation. The gist
of the case was whether this gentleman had or had not rendered
assistance to the Confederates, as alleged by Mr. Seward. The noble

an unwarrantable stretch of authority, said that the power of

<hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">On Board the Guide, Hatteras Inlet,</p>
<p rend="right"> North Carolina, Jan. 22.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> the evening of the day on which I dated my last letter from the
Picket we arrived at Fortress Monroe, accompanied by most of the ships
composing the Burnside expedition, only half a dozen or so being
delayed by the fog. The latter joined the fleet on the following
morning in Hampton Roads, with the exception of the John Trucks, which
had got on shore in the Chesapeake, and had not been got off up to the time of our leaving; she had the Epeneuil Zouaves on board. There has been so much said of Fortress Monroe by others at various times during the present campaign, and especially by Mr. Russell, that there is little or nothing left for me to bore your readers with in reference to this famous American stronghold. Neither have I made you a sketch of the place, which is singularly inappropriate for illustration, being nothing more than an intrenched camp on a low spit of sand, but immensely strong for all that. Besides, we spent but
little time there, and that was all confusion of preparation for
departure for our unknown destination. The secret had been well
kept. Not a soul, except the General-in-Chief and perhaps Commodore
Gouldsborough, had an inkling of our<hi rend="italic"> feuille de
route</hi>, though manifold were the conjectures of those with whom I
was thrown in contact. I heard every place mentioned, from Galveston,
in Texas, up to the York River and the Rappahannock, and some even
supposed we were bound up the Potomac to clear out the Confederate
batteries at Evansport and Shipping Point. But this state of
uncertainty was not to last long, as the officer commanding the
troops on each ship had sealed orders given him, which were to be
opened after getting six miles to sea. Well, we arrived, as I have
said, at the place of rendezvous off Fortress Monroe, on the evening of the 10th inst., and we weighed anchor on the following night at 11 p.m. My vessel was the Picket, a screw, the smallest in the fleet, on which General
 Burnside had established his head-quarters, much against the wish
of every one, for, although she was perfectly new, her proportions were scarcely those of a ship fitted to cope with a heavy sea. Before leaving there were all kinds of discomfiting prognostications about the weather. Old pilots shook their heads end prophesied north-easters; anxious groups surrounded the barometer and reported it going down rapidly, while evil crokers foretold worse disasters than happened to Sherman's expedition on its way to Port Royal. But matters had been already delayed too long, and so it was anchor apeak and away despite ancient mariners and mercurial oracles. As I had been invited to accompany the General, and had accepted, of course we rowed in the same boat; where he went there should I go; but I must confess I should have preferred his choosing a large steamer instead of the mite of a cockleshell we were embarked in. Well, when we had got six miles down the roads towards Cape Henry, the General gave instructions to our Captain to shape his course for Hatteras, and then, for the first time, I became aware of our destination. We were to pass over the bulkhead of Pamlico Sound and attack the Confederate position at Roanoke Island; and, if successful in this, to advance on New Berne, and thus form a basis from which to make approaches towards the centre of North Carolina, occupying the different lines of rails, and cutting off the communications of the Secessionists on the Potomac with the Southern seaboard States. To do this we had a force of something like 16,000 men, and a fleet of a hundred transports and store-ships, including fourteen or fifteen small river steamers fitted as gun-boats to act in shallow water.</p>

<p>Woe is me!  There was more in the prognostications of the old pilot and barometer than we were willing to admit, for on rounding Cape Henry we got into the trough of a real Atlantic sea, and found the breeze rapidly freshening into a gale. For a moment we all thought we were going to "turn turtle," and I, who had just laid down on a couch in the deck-cabin, was hurled against the door, which burst open with the concussion and shot me through it into the lee scuppers, where I rolled about in six or eight inches of the wholesome briny. At the present moment I am greatly confused as to the evolutions we performed in that one great lurch, followed, alas! by many after ones; but I cannot help thinking we stood on the funnel for at least five minutes. When at last I collected my battered remains together I found a party of anxious, lightly-clad, shivering individuals holding on to stanchions and ropes. However, the captain got her head to it and matters were somewhat improved, and the little Picket struggled forward very much after the fashion that some gentlemen do returning home late from a dinner party. I groped my way back to my couch over the ruins of the steward's crockery, and, by a judicious use of padding, succeeded in wedging myself in
 tight, and so slept soundly till morning.</p>
<p> Day dawned with a thick fog hod a heavy swell on. Now and then the misty veil would rise and give us occasional glimpses of the coast of North Carolina, arid, uninviting, end desolate in appearance: nothing more than a succession of hummocks of sand, jotted here and there with the skeleton timbers of many good ships cast away on the inhospitable shore. Towards evening the wind blew a perfect gale from S.S.W., making the eating of one's dinner exceedingly problematical. The only way of taking in supplies was to hold on by one hand and watch the opportunity of feeding with the other. Two of the party, after the first spoonful of soup, betrayed unmistakable signs of a loathing of food, causing "the steward to hasten with the necessary basin ;" but, with the characteristic obstinacy of people attacked with their complaint, they repudiated anything being the matter with them, and, by delaying their exit till the supreme moment, overreached themselves and those sitting beside them.</p>
<p>Oh dear! I wish there were no such things as naval expeditions for

correspondents to go upon. Before I get through with this letter I

shall have to relate experiences that will make your readers think I am

romancing; and this suspicion will hardly repay me for the misery I

have endured during the last fortnight. Not a day has passed that it
has not blown a gale, diversified by an occasional hurricane and a
wreck or two. But belay there! as we nautical men say, and let
me spin my yam in a methodical manner. Well, as I was saying, towards
evening it blew a gale of wind, and then we found out our mistake in
going to sea in a little river steamer like the Picket. The only good
that the gale did us was to blow away the fog-banks that ever and anon
enveloped us in their damp and opaque folds, giving us a chance to
judge our whereabouts. But, alas! it also brought us many
ills. The "white horses" raced madly over the ever-increasing mounds
of green water that piled themselves on our bows, a heaving barrier to
our progress. Vainly the little vessel dipped and staggered forward;
before she could rise to one sea another would strike her and send her
reeling back, spars and hull trembling from each successive blow. We
had barely sufficient power to keep her head to it, and, as all hands
held on, there were many anxious glances at the coming wave, speeding
along as though it would engulf us on its way. About midnight we saw
the lights of a steamer half a mile distant on our port bow, and to
attract the attention of those on board we fired a shotted gun astern
of her, which had the effect of bringing her within speaking
distance. She turned out to be the Eastern Queen, a large ship
belonging to the expedition; and, as she rose and fell within crushing
proximity, we hailed her Captain to lie by us till daylight. Not a
soul on board closed their eyes in sleep during the long dark hours
that waned not. Once I thought we were gone, for, while clutching the
after-davits, I found myself buried in the sea up to my waist, the
gunwales rolling completely under. In that one moment I recollected
the most trivial occurrences of my earliest boyhood; thirty years of
unimportant existence flashed through my mind. But this mental
biography was brought to an abrupt termination by the return jerk of
the vessel, which wrenched me from my hold and deposited me, with a
bruised head, amongst a pile of ammunition-boxes. Day broke with a
leaden sky, against which the angry, white-crested waves raced their
mad career over the reefs of Cape Hatteras, that threw its headland
oceanwards but eight miles distant. From our hurricane-deck fourteen
steamers could be seen labouring to weather this storm-point. How
should we fare with our small-powered engine and cockleshell boat?
Bravely we breasted on, staggering beneath the giant blows of each
successive sea, our decks swept fore and aft, and all on board reeling
from side to side like drunken men. One figure stood immovable
grasping by the bits, scanning the horizon for traces of ships as we
rose on each glittering mass of foam. It was the square, manly form of
General Burnside, whose anxiety for the fate of his army was intense,
many of the vessels on which the troops were embarked being
nothing more than huge top-hampered river steamers, with projecting
guards that would smash up like cardboard if fairly struck by a
sea. But, happily, as we and the day advanced, more wreathy lines of
smoke indicated the approach of others of the fleet; and oh, good
fortune! by 11 a.m. we had weathered the cape and were hove to
off Hatteras Bar, waiting for the little black tug-boat that was
steaming out to pilot us in. Without exaggeration, I may state the
height of the breakers through which the narrow channel ran to have
been nearly, if not quite, twenty feet, with a depth of thirteen feet
in the deepest part. The Picket was the first to venture over, closely
followed by the Peabody and Eastern City, and having on her starboard
quarter the pilot-tug. So awful was the entourage of hissing breakers,
and so certain our destruction should we yaw off but a point or two
either way, that this was probably the most hazardous period of our
tempestuous voyage. The Sketch I send (engraved on page 187) is
faithful to the truth, and will better illustrate our position than
anything I can express in writing. By midday we were over and at
anchor in Pamlico Sound, under shelter of a spit of sand which up to
the present constitutes the entire Federal department of North
Carolina. On this land, partially submerged at high water, are built
the forts captured by Commodore Stringham and General Butler last
August or early in September, I forget which; but to my mind the
greatest harm that could have been done the Confederates would have
been to leave them quietly in possession of this God-forsaken
spot. Please, as the showman says, to turn to the other Sketch
(engraved on page 186), and judge for yourself if such a place is fit
for habitation by aught save clams and muscles. But the occupation has
been of great advantage to the Federal Government, as it has
effectually placed a seal upon the outlets of Albemarle and Pamlico
Sounds, shutting in the few vessels the Southerners have<hi rend="italic"> dans ces parages.</hi></p>

<p>It was on the 18th inst. that we cast our anchor in the waters of
Secessia, fourscore vessels drifting and crashing into each other in
a harbour, if so it can be designated, scarcely large enough to float
a dozen comfortably. At one moment the little Picket had three huge
floating barracks blown on to her in a heap, making it extremely
probable we should drag to sea together and go to pieces on the
bar. Everybody on board worked with a will; axes and hand-spikes were
in every hand, assisting to clear away the surrounding wreck; and your
correspondent as he sprang for the chains of the Northerner, grasping
a fender to ease off the shock as she closed in, missed his footing,
and was only rescued from being flattened out like a pancake by the
activity of some soldiers who dragged him up the side a second before
the collision took place.</p>

<p>The great difficulty to be contended against in the harbour is the
shallowness of the water, except in certain places, and in these the
ships are wedged together, with scarcely room to swing, and with the
rush of the tide out from the Sound, or in from the ocean, assisted by
incessant gales of wind, there is hardly a minute of the day that some
vessel does not come to grief. About a mile up is the bulkhead, formed
by a ridge of sandbanks, over which the gunboats and transports of lighter draught have to pass before they can advance to the attack of Roanoke Island. I foresee even now, though many are over (all the gun-boats are) that there will be great difficulty about this, for the vessel on which I am writing is stuck hard and fast, and thumping and humping in a howling northeaster. In answer to our signals for assistance the Commodore, who has come down to take command of the naval portion of the expedition, replies that nothing at present can be done for us, as it is dangerous, and we must wait for the weather to moderate before any attempt can be made to relieve us. This is a very pleasant state of affairs, considering we have only four casks of water in the hold and no means of communicating with the store-ships. Fortunately we put our troops ashore to lighten us before attempting to cross, otherwise we should have been in a very bad condition indeed. I hope our timbers are sound and well riveted together, else I may expect to disappear through the floor beneath me, after the fashion of a pantomime trick, during one of the thumps. By-the-by, as I have digressed, I may as well mention here that General Burnside has changed his quarters from the Picket, and we are now on board a large steamer called the Guide. On the 14th, the day after our arrival, the City of New York struck on the bar, and in a short time became a total wreck (she is shown in the Illustration on page 186). Fortunately, the crew and those on board were saved in surf-boats, but three other poor fellows attempting to reach the harbour in a launch from a weather-bound vessel outside got capsized in the breakers, and sank before our eyes: the oarsmen, who, luckily, had on life-preservers, were picked up by a schooner. The three lost were the mate of the ship and the Colonel and Doctor of the New Jersey regiment. Among the disasters to be chronicled on this day is the sinking of the Zouave transport inside the inlet. She drifted on her anchor and stove in her bottom. Two or three tugs got round her and took off the men.</p>

<p> On the 15th we changed to the Guide, and had scarcely got
on board when a barque came crashing into her stem on, driving
her jibboom into our galley, and scattering the cooks and
preparations for dinner. On the 16th the wind changed from a gale of
wind from S.S.W. to a still harder blow from N.W., preventing us from
making any progress with the lightening of the ships that were to
cross the bulkhead. Measles were reported to have broken out on some
of the transports, with a few cases of fever. At dark all hands were
startled by the report of a heavy gun, and on reaching the hurricane-deck we saw a large brig drifting rapidly on to the bar. As it
grew darker and her outline became less defined the excitement became
intense. It was evident to all she was in a most critical position,
and every moment might be her last. Slowly the black hull rose and
fell, each time gliding nearer and nearer to the vortex of white
breakers, which, once amongst, nothing we might attempt could save
her. Suddenly a fringe of musketry fire surrounded her bulwarks,
blue-lights were burnt in her tops, and imagination brought us through the howling blasts, the despairing shrieks of the terrified soldiers crowding her decks. Volley after volley succeeded each other in rapid succession, and yet apparently we could not help her; none dared face the tempest and, perhaps, share her doom. General Burnside boarded every steam-tug in the harbour; offered any reward, and also to go himself, but all held back. Were three hundred fellowmen to be launched into eternity, their death-cries in our ears, and yet no effort made to save them? Hurrah! one brave seaman volunteered to take his little steamer out, General Burnside jumped on board of her, but, at the earnest entreaties of his friends, he delegated the honour of the position to a member of his staff. Anxiously we watched her progress through the troubled waters, battling her way and wrestling with the waves as she advanced on her mission of mercy. Fortunately, she reached the bar before the brig had been thoroughly drawn into the breakers, and, getting a hawser to her, succeeded in rescuing her from her perilous position. When the steamer returned she had scarcely a vestige of bulwark or paddlebox left: all had been smashed and carried away by the force of the sea. In fact, each day has seen some narrow escape or bad disaster. There are at present four total wrecks and five or six vessels on shore, the last evil report being the loss of the Pocahontas, with ninety horses on board, twenty-five of which only were saved. The crew reached the shore by a warp.</p>

<p rend="right">Jan. 26.</p>

<p>With one exception, when it blew a topsail breeze, we have had a
continuous howl from all the points of the compass, making it next to
impossible to progress with the lightening of the vessels destined to
cross the bulkhead. Probably the greatest misfortune of all is the
non-arrival of six water-ships, on which we depended for supplies
after our ten days' rations had been consumed. The consequence is, the
entire fleet is on short allowance, with no immediate prospect of
relief, as in all probability the expected vessels have been lost
during the fearful hurricane that prevailed with unmitigated violence
for three days, and only ceased yesterday morning. During this time we
on board the Guide were thumping our bottom out on the bulkhead, and
have only just been got off, while at least a dozen other ships
displayed their colours, Union down. Most of these were suffering from
short allowance of everything, but no help could be given them till
the fury of the storm had abated. Our position was the most
problematical of all, as our safety simply depended on the strength of
the ship's timbers, and her power to endure the continuous straining
as she thumped from side to side in her bed of sand. This morning we have news of another wreck outside the spit. Numerous bodies have been washed on shore, but, as nothing remains of the vessel, we are ignorant whether<lb/>
she belonged to the expedition or not. The probability is she is one of the missing water-schooners.</p>

<p>I have been here long enough to ascertain one fact, and that is,
with a few exceptions, General Burnside is the only competent man in
the expedition; and, from the personal respect and friendship I feel
for him, I trust he is not going to be made the scapegoat of the
apathy, supineness, and incompetency of others. The Commodore, whose
duty it should have been to attend to everything connected with the
sea transport of the troops, has shown himself but twice in the
quarter-gallery of his ship, and each time with his hands thrust
deeply into his pockets, gazing listlessly at ships running ashore or
drifting into each other. General Burnside, on the contrary, has
performed all the duties of a harbour-master, narrowly escaping being
swamped on more than one occasion. Whenever a ship has been in
distress the General has been the first man off to her assistance; and
there is not a grade in his army that he has not filled during the
last fortnight, so anxious is he for the wellbeing and comfort of his troops.</p>

<p>To-day is fine, and more steamers are working over the bulkhead;
in all probability the first brigade, escorted by the gun-boats, will
be on its way to Roanoke to-night. The General changes his quarters
this afternoon to the Spalding, and I go with him. In a day or two, I presume, there will have been many heads broken; for, if we can believe the contrabands who make their way here hourly, preparations have been made to give us a warm reception. They tell us the Confederates have a dozen gun-boats and some powerful shore batteries mounted with l00-pounders. In our expedition there cannot be less than seventy or eighty guns afloat; and so I suppose when the entertainment commences there will be lots of noise made.</p>

<p>This letter leaves by a bearer of despatches, who has promised to mail it for me in Washington. My next will probably contain the account of a victory or a defeat, should nothing in the shape of shot

or shell interfere with my pen or pencil.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi><lb/>
AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Africa brings New York journals of the 12th ult. The general tenor of the advices is again favourable to the Federals. The steady perseverance and more lasting qualities of the North have already nearly cleared Kentucky of the Secessionists, carried the war into Western Tennessee, and seized on two more points on the coast of North Carolina.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>News has been received from the Burnside expedition to the coast

of North Carolina. The telegrams are very meagre, but we gather from them that on the 5th ult. General Burnside sailed from Hatteras Inlet for Roanoke Island, which lies between Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds. This island had been carefully fortified by the Confederates, and they had had warning of the point of attack. The island was captured after three days' fighting. The loss was heavy on both sides. The Confederate flotilla of gun-boats was dispersed; three were sunk and two captured. On the 9th ult. the expedition attacked Elizabeth City, which the inhabitants evacuated. It was completely burnt, but whether by the inhabitants or the shells from the Federal fleet is not known. The Federals had occupied the site of the burnt city, and were advancing on Edentown. These two towns are situated on the north of Albemarle Sound.</p>

<p>In Tennessee, Fort Donnelson has not yet been attacked. The Memphis and Ohio Railroad bridge, fifteen miles above Fort Henry, has been taken possession of by the Federal troops. This cuts off the connection between Memphis and Nashville. Federal gun-boats have ascended the Tennessee River as high as Florence, Alabama, and encountered no opposition. General Smith on the west, and General Grant on the east, of that river were pursuing the retreating Confederates. The report that the gravity of the circumstances had

 drawn General Beauregard from Manassas to Nashville, leaving General Johnstone in command at the former position, has been confirmed.</p>

<p>General Thomas, in command of the Federal forces in southeastern Kentucky, had advanced no farther south than Monticello, the state of the roads hindering a more speedy progress. From the papers found in the deserted camp of the Confederates, on the Cumberland, it is evident by the admission of their own military and civil leaders that in Eastern Tennessee the mass of the people are loyal to the Union, and wait with impatience the arrival of the Union armies.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The term of the twelve months' volunteers from the Gulf States is
now expiring, and in many of the best regiments a large majority
decline to re-enlist for the war.</p>

<p>The Confederate Government had declined to admit Commissioners Fish and Ames into the Southern States.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ARREST OF GENERAL STONE.</p>

<p>This General, till lately in command of the army of the Upper
Potomac, was arrested at Washington on the 9th, and sent to Fort Lafayette on the following serious charges:&#x2014;</p>

<p> 1. For misbehaviour at the battle of Ball's Bluff.</p>

<p>2. For holding correspondence with the enemy before and since the battle of

Ball's Bluff, and receiving visits from rebel officers in his camp.</p>

<p> 3. For treacherously suffering the enemy to build a fort, or strong work, since the battle of Ball's Bluff, under his guns, without molestation.</p>

<p>4. For a treacherous design to expose his force to capture and destruction

by the enemy under pretence of orders for a movement from the
Commanding General which had not been given.</p>

<p>The news of this arrest caused the greatest consternation among

the officers of the regular army, to which General Stone belonged.</p>

<p rend="center"> THE ADMINISTRATION.</p>

<p>The correspondence between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Cameron, the late
Secretary for War, on the occasion of his retirement, has been
published. The correspondence is of a highly friendly and even
affectionate character, and is dated Jan. 11. Mr. Lincoln speaks of
the Czar of Russia as the "great Sovereign whose personal and hereditary friendship for the United States so much endears him to Americans."</p>

<p>The correspondence between Secretary Seward and Mr. Dayton,

United States' Minister to Paris, concerning the admission of American
citizens to the Tuileries has been published. Mr. Seward thinks that
Mr. Dayton ought to furnish the profession or occupation of the
applicants but not their "social position," as distinctions of social
position are unknown in America. The letter concludes in a highly-patriotic strain:&#x2014;</p>

<p><q> "It is peculiarly uncomfortable at the present moment, to find American citizens leaving their country a prey to faction and civil war, disturbing the Court of a friendly Power, and embarrassing our representative there with questions of personal interest and pretension. Let the Emperor and
Empress of France receive when they will, and as many or few as they
will, and let all others, as well as those who are admitted, turn their
attention to the question how they can serve their country abroad;
and, if they can find no better way to do it than by making their
attendance in the saloons of the Tuileries, let them return home to a
"country that now, for the first time, and not for a long time, needs
the active efforts of every one of its loyal children to save itself from destruction. Finally, above all things, have no question with the Government of Fiance on this subject. Rather introduce nobody, however justly distinguished, then let a question of fashion or ceremony appear in the records of the important period in which we are acting for the highest interests of our country and of humanity."</q></p>
<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The House Treasury Note Bill is now before the Senate's Finance Committee. Among the amendments proposed is one making it obligatory to pay the interest of the national debt in coin. In the meantime a bill authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to issue 10,000,000 dols. in Treasury notes has been hurried through both Houses.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner offered a series of resolutions declaring that the revolted
States have committed felo de se, and that their relations as members of the United States no longer exist; that their allegiance has been severed, and the Federal Government owes no obligation to any pretended State Government usurping a certain territory; that individuals occupying such territory owe allegiance to the General Government only, and the General Government to the individuals; there fore, persona heretofore held as slaves under local laws, now of no effect, may look henceforth to the General Government for protection as individuals. These resolutions were only laid aside by a vote of 21 against 15.</p>

<p>The Senate has passed the appropriations for fortifying the lake shores and the Northern frontier.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon's speech to the Corps L&#xE9;gislatif was well received in New York, and affected the stock market favourably.</p>

<p>The New York journals of the 12th ult. publish Earl Russell's
despatch on the subject of maritime rights in full, and unaccompanied by comment. The despatch was only received at a late hour on the previous night.</p>

<p>General Stanton, the Secretary of War, was labouring under severe
indisposition.</p>

<p>General Fremont was to receive an important command, having disproved, to the satisfaction of the Secretary of War, the charges of corruption alleged against him.</p>

<p>The Maine Senate has followed the example of the Legislature of Michigan and passed resolutions in favour of confiscating, liberating, and arming the slaves, if it shall be a military necessity, by a vote of 24 against 4.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MARCH</hi> 1, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> arms of the Federal Government have
achieved a valuable success in the capture of the isle of Roanoke. The
destruction of the weak fleet of the Confederates is a small matter,
but the opening up the way for General Burnside to attack in rear the
army, which it was not thought advisable to assail in front, is an
operation that makes a mark in the campaign. The country into which
General Burnside has to penetrate, if he is to assume the offensive,
is very difficult, but there is reason to believe that its
difficulties have been exaggerated. At all events, he has established
a base of operations. The plan of General M'Clellan would appear to be
a scheme for sundering the Confederate forces as much as possible,
instead of attempting to overwhelm them in little; and if he
perseveres in such tactics, and the money of the North hold out, he
may have the honour of achieving a comparatively bloodless
triumph. The officers of the South have learned the trade of war, and
know better than to refuse to surrender untenable positions. In the
meantime, the civilians are warring in Congress, and Mr. Charles
Sumner has laid before it his bold proposal for dealing with the
South. He wishes to declare all local government in the Slave States
as at an end, to reduce those States to the condition of territories,
and thereby to place the whole population, including the four millions
of slaves, on an equality of civil rights. It can hardly be supposed
that Congress will think that matters are sufficiently forward for the
adoption of this plan, which could be justified only when the North
should be in force sufficient to prevent the servile war that would be
invited by such a proclamation; but that such a proposition should be
brought forward at all shows the increasing power and courage of the
Abolitionists. In London the birthday of Washington has been
celebrated by American residents and visitors, but the demonstration
has been confined to the Loyalists, and the most friendly sentiments
towards England were enunciated....</p>
<p>It is stated that the Captain of the Sumter has been arrested at
the instance of the Captain of the Tuscarora, but we do not learn, as
yet, whether the former is to be handed over to the latter; if so,
there will be "a short shrift."</p></div2>

<p>The<hi rend="italic"> Philadelphia Enquirer</hi> of Jan. 28 gives the following amusing
account of a lev&#xE9;e held by the new Federal Secretary of War, Mr.
Stanton:&#x2014;</p>
<p>The clock strikes ten, the awaiting crowd rush in as the doors swing
open, and, being among them, we soon find ourselves in the presence of
the Secretary. Now one stands in front of him, and with a smiling
countenance he reaches out his hand, and, takes a hearty grip with a
grey-haired man. "Well, Sir, what is your wish?" "My name is &#x2014;&#x2014;; my son
fought at Springfield, and was wounded in the arm. He was on Fremont's
staff, but is now without a commission. I want one for him, that he
may again try his other arm here on the Potomac or in Missouri." "You shall have it, Sir," replied Mr. Stanton, and, turning to his secretary, he ordered him to note the case. "Return home," he added; "the papers will be sent you."</p>

<p>As the man attempted to thank him, he stepped to one side to two ladies
who had just come in. "Madam, what can I do for you?" "Want a clerk-ship for my son; his father was killed at the battle of Belmont." Turning
again, be noted the case, took the address, told the lady to send him a sample
of her boy's writing, and he would care for him. The other was connected
with a Minnesota regiment over the river, and had some complaint about
the treatment she had received in camp from some of the
officers. "Madam, you must go to the head-quarters of General
M'Clellan." "I have been there, Sir, and they would not read my
papers, or listen to my case." "Then give them to me, and I'll see why."</p>

<p>A small bright-eyed boy, alone, was trying to work his way through the crowd, and the Secretary turned to him and asked what he wanted. "I want my father got out, Sir. He was taken at Bull Bun, and has not come home with the rest." He gave his name and regiment; it was noted; and the Secretary, lifting him up, kissed him upon the forehead, and said, " Your father should be proud of such a noble boy, and I'll see that he is released."</p>

<p>A man with a half-military dress says he has been wronged by the examining board, and has been deprived of the command of his regiment (a Philadelphia cavalry regiment). "Sorry, Sir, if it is not all right. I cannot go back to investigate the acts of my predecessor." The Colonel insisted his case was a plain one, if he could be heard. "Well," said the Secretary, "If you will get the officers to reconsider it I will then listen to it."</p>

<p>An individual has some new invention for firearms. "Go to the Ordnance

Department and get them to investigate it, and if they will recommend
it I will be glad to see it adopted." A Colonel with a green uniform
on has some passes he wants to read. "Are you an army officer?" "Yes,
Sir." "Then you cannot be heard until to-morrow; come and see me then."</p>

<p>A large and well-dressed man wanted a word in private. "What about?" Some little matter about a contract he had for horses. "Cannot interfere, Sir; go to General Meigs. If there is anything wrong he will rectify it." Another succeeds in getting him off to the side of the room, and the conversation is inaudible until the Secretary replied, "No, Sir, on no account will I interfere in any contract while I am here for anything from a thimble up. There are men appointed to attend to that department, and I shall hold them to a strict accountability for every action."</p>

<p>Two soldiers wanted to be paid for the time they were in confinement at Richmond, having just been released, and presented a furlough they had received a week ago, and also an order for their pay for time and rations. "Why do you not take this to Major Beckwith, and have him attend to it?" "We did, Sir; and he says he has no order that will cover our case, and for want of 'forms' we are afraid we will be kept here until our time is up, and we want to go home and see the folks before going at it again." Turning to

his secretary, he ordered him to write to Major Beckwith, and order him to report forthwith in writing why these men were not paid up, instead of being kept waiting. It was done; he signed it himself, and said,"Here, take that to him, and bring an answer."</p>

<p>After some other visitors are described, the account goes on:&#x2014;</p>

<p>In came Major Beckwith, with the note sent by the returned prisoners.

"Why are those men kept waiting?" "Because I have no order for their special case." "Mr.Wilson, issue an order that will cover all the prisoners that may be released in future, and allow them full pay for every day they are confined in rebel prisons. Major, I have just learnt there are over 150 now waiting for their pay; every man most be paid to-day, and speed them on to their homes."</p>

<p>A tall men wants a commission in the regular army. "Have you been in
any battle yet, Sir?" "I was in the Mexican War." "That won't do; that
is too far back." "I was at Great Bethel." "That is better. I will examine
your record myself, and inform you if you are appointed."</p>

<p>A stout, healthy young man wanted a commission or clerkship. "Have you
been in any battle?" "No, Sir." "Then it will be of no use to apply, for I shall make all my appointments from the list of heroes; those who fight the country's battles must be cared for first."</p>

<p>Another wanted an appointment as quartermaster. "There are my recommendations, Sir, and I would be glad if you can read, them." "I cannot
do it now, I have not the time; but I will examine them." "Very well," replied
the would-be-quartermaster; "just read them. If you have any better man,
according to those papers, let him have the office; in that case I
don't want it."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE WAR IN AMERICA.&#x2014;GENERAL BURNSIDE'S
EXPEDITION.<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">On Board the Spalding, Pamlico Sound,</p>
<p rend="right"> North Carolina, Jan. 29.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> last, after immense exertion on the part
of those concerned, General Burnside especially having worked night and
day, sufficient transports have been got over the bulkhead to carry
11,000 men up the Sound, and it is now a mere question of reshipping
the troops that were landed to lighten the vessels and to provision
them for ten days. It appears to me there must have been gross
stupidity or cupidity displayed by those authorised to purchase the
steamers for the service they are now engaged in, as their draught of
water, in nine cases out of ten, exceeds by a great deal the depth
found on the various banks and shoals that block the entrance to the
inland seas of North Carolina; hence the delay of the
expedition. Before we could continue up the Sound to Roanoke all the
larger vessels had to land their troops and provisions, otherwise they
never could have crossed the bulkhead; and, as it is, they have been
worried through the sand, inch by inch, a distance of over three
miles, many taking four and five days to force their way
through. Again, the channel is so narrow that it is impossible
for more than one ship at a time to attempt the passage; and, should
one stick, she has to be removed before another can be brought up. The
two last are now on their way over, but, unfortunately, the leading
vessel has grounded, and may cause a further delay of a day or two;
however, the general opinion appears to be that we shall get off by
the end of the week, and, when once fairly started, it only takes ten
hours to reach Roanoke. Now, had steamers of lighter draught been
provided, nothing would have prevented the expedition from steaming up
the Sound on the first day of our arrival and striking a decisive blow
before preparations could be made by the Confederates to offer
effectual resistance, as it is extremely probable they were in
ignorance of the destination of the Federal fleet. By this time they
will have learned through their spies everything required to be known
(two Secesh gun-boats came within sight the other day and
reconnoitred), and prepare accordingly a warm reception for the
invading force.</p>

<p>As I understand the plan of attack it is as follows :&#x2014;The gun-boats
will take the lead up the Sound, followed by the larger transports
having the troops on board, and the rear will be brought up by the
store-ships in tow of tugs. On arriving off the southern extremity of
Roanoke Island, the former will engage the batteries, which are said
to be immensely strong there, while the troops under the cover of
their fire will be transferred to scows and surf-boats, and, passing
over the shallows on the western side, land, and take the Confederates
in the rear, cutting off their retreat in the event of their being
beaten. Now, there is just a possibility of the Southern fleet showing
fight; they have fourteen gun-boats heavily armed with guns of large
calibre, taken from the Norfolk Navy-yard; and, if they do, they may
cause the Federalists great annoyance in going up the Sound. A few
shells thrown among the transports, crowded as they are with troops,
would create a considerable amount of confusion, and, as I happen to
be on board the leading ship, the General's, I most fervently hope
they will do nothing of the kind. As it is, I presume we shall get
awfully pounded on drawing within range of the batteries. Well,
supposing Roanoke to be taken, the expedition will then proceed to New
Berne, seizing the railway at that place, and, advancing inland to
Goldsboro', occupy all the converging lines there with ultimate
intentions on Raleigh; thus, as I said in my previous letter, cutting
off all communication with the more Southern States, and leaving the
Confederate army at Manassas helpless as regards reinforcements or
supplies from any State south of Virginia. In Kentucky the Unionists
are pushing forward to assist and support the movements of this
expedition, the idea being that the two forces should form a junction,
and so entirely shut out Beauregard's army from the rest of Secessia;
then, I presume, M'Clellan would advance with the main body of
Federalists, and fight the decisive battle so long expected.</p>

<p>The last news we have here tells us that Sherman is about to move
on Savannah from Port Royal, that Butler is preparing to menace New
Orleans from Ship Island, and that the huge expedition down the
Mississippi has started, or is at the point of starting. So that
another month may bring you tidings of the last of the Confederate
States' Government, or such intelligence as will probably cause its
recognition by the European Powers, the latter in the event of the
failure of the Federal plans. Mind, I don't mean to prophesy any
successes for the Unionists; I simply mention the programme apparently
to be followed. Again, as far as this expedition is concerned, I  have
certain doubts of its achieving all required of it, as I cannot shut
my eyes to the glaring incapacity of those whose business it is to
second the General in command. If everything depended on the exertions
of one man&#x2014;I speak of General Burnside&#x2014;I am convinced my task would be
to record a victory; as it is, I must wait the issue of the fight.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Cunard steamer America we have telegrams
from Halifax to the 21st ult., Boston journals to the 19th ult., and New York journals of the day previous. The Federals have obtained such a decided military success as to afford ground for the belief that the Confederate Government will be shortlived.</p>

<p rend="center"> <hi rend="smallcaps">The Surrender of Fort Donnelson.</hi></p>

<p>Fort Donnelson, on the Cumberland River, was invested on the 13th,
and, after three days' hard fighting, was surrendered unconditionally.
The land forces of the Federals numbered 40,000 men, under the command of General Grant. Commodore Foote brought up six gun-boats
(four of them iron-plated) to the attack on the river side. From the
moment of the investment of the fort the Federal troops lay on their
arms night and day, half the time without provisions, all the time
without tents, and a portion in a heavy storm of rain and snow. The
gun-boat attack was unsuccessful, Commodore Foote acknowledging that
four of his boats were disabled, and forty-one of his men killed and
wounded. The total loss of the Federals on land and water is at least
300 killed and 700 wounded and missing. The loss of officers is very
heavy. The Confederate loss of life is less heavy, as they fought
behind intrenchments. They are, however, minus an army and some of
their best Generals. Fifteen thousand men capitulated, including
Generals Sydney Johnston (who shared with Beauregard the honours of
Bull Run), Buckner, and Bushrod. General Floyd escaped with 5000 men
during the night preceding the surrender. He and his force went up the
river on board some steamers without the knowledge of their superior
officers. The Confederates lost, besides forty-eight field-pieces,
seven heavy guns, twenty thousand stand of arms, and a large quantity of commissary stores. On the morning of the surrender the Federal troops were about to storm the fort with the bayonet.</p>

<p> The news of this great success was received with great rejoicing in
Congress, among the army of the Potomac, and generally throughout the Country. Congress passed resolutions thanking the army and navy. How it has affected the people of the Seceding States we do not yet know, but the impression is general that the resistance to the victorious armies of the Union will soon cease. General Grant has been promoted to the rank of Major-General.</p>

<p>Commodore Foote is already pressing on to Clarksville, about twenty
miles above Fort Donnelson. The Confederates have already evacuated
Clarksville. They will make their next stand in defence of the important manufacturing city of Nashville. General Beauregard has fallen back on this city from Bowling Green, Kentucky. The Federal army, commanded by General Mitchell, is close on his rear.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CAMPAIGN IN ARKANSAS.</p>

<p>General Price, beaten out of Missouri, is being pursued by the

Federals through Arkansas. Much of his baggage, several officers,

and a considerable number of privates belonging to the rear of his army, have been captured.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BURNSIDE EXPEDITION.</p>

<p>The official account of the exploits of this expedition have
appeared. General Burnside announces that he captured on Roanoke
Island six forts, forty guns, 2500 prisoners, and upwards of 3000
small arms. The Federal loss was thirty-five killed and about 200
wounded. Commodore Goldsborough occupied Edenton on the 12th, without opposition. In view of these reverses, Governor Letcher, of Virginia, has issued a proclamation stating that recent reverses "demand an exhibition of all our energies, an uncompromising spirit, and stern and determined resolution." He recommends a lev&#xE9;e en masse of the whole of the male population between the ages of sixteen and sixty.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill making Treasury

notes a legal tender, with the Senate's amendment making the interest on the National Debt payable in coin.</p>

<p>Mr. Fish and Bishop Ames have agreed with the Confederate Government on an exchange of prisoners. At the time when the negotiation was concluded the Confederates held 300 prisoners more than the number held by the Federals.</p>

<p>The War Department has issued an order directing the release of all
political prisoners, except spies, on their subscribing a parole
engaging them to render no aid to the enemies of the United States. To
all such persons who shall keep their parole the President has granted
an amnesty for any past offences of treason or
disloyalty. Extraordinary arrests will henceforth be made under the
direction of the military authorities alone.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The New York and Philadelphia journals preserve an entire silence on
the subject of Earl Russell's closing despatch on the Trent
affair. This is a sign that it commands the respect if not the
acquiescence of the journalists, and that they prefer to leave the
consideration of the points involved to the Secretary of State and the
jurists of the country. Elated, however, by the recent victories, they
begin to carp at the Mexican expedition, and to warn the Allies that
the American people will not permit the restoration of a European
monarchy on their southern border. The <hi rend="italic">Boston Advertiser</hi> devotes a column to the discussion of Earl Russell's despatch, the positions of
which meet with its approval as enlarging the rights of neutrals.</p>
<p>Considerable popular excitement exists in New York concerning the
approaching execution of Captain Gordon, the slavetrader. Numerous
petitions have been forwarded to Washington to commute the sentence.
Public sympathy runs high in favour of the condemned.
Professor Agassiz is delivering a series of popular lectures on
natural history in Irving Hall, New York.</p>

<p rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</p>

<p>The last accounts from California state that an extraordinary
emigration to the goldfields of British Columbia is expected to take
place this spring. One steamer had just sailed from San Francisco
with 500 passengers for that destination.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MARCH</hi> 8, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A decisive</hi> and important victory gained by the Federals has
naturally thrown the Northern States into great excitement. About this
action there can be no mistake, and there is no need for
exaggeration. Fort Donnelson has fallen after three days of hard
fighting and very considerable slaughter on both sides. Three
Confederate Generals are prisoners, with, it is said, 15,000 men; and
General Floyd, with 5000 men, saved himself by a flight which is not considered
"chivalrous."<lb/> Right and left, therefore, the forces of the
Union are clearing their way, and their operations may speedily
induce General M'Clellan to advance. It would appear that no time was to be lost, the victors in Tennessee were pushing onwards, and, though the character of the country rendered a check possible at any moment, it was not thought that they
 would meet serious opposition for some time to come. It is
also reported that Savannah has fallen, and there is no improbability
in the news. At length, therefore, the North may fairly be said to be
putting out its strength in earnest and delivering the effective blows
which might have been expected from the magnitude of its
preparations. The Secretary at War has availed himself of these
successes to rebuke in a
stern Puritan tone the language in which various American
writers have sought to imitate the Napoleonic bombast, which, as he
says, began in "infidel France," and led the French up to
Waterloo. There is no "organisation of victories," he says, the
triumph being due to the spirit of the Lord putting valour into the
soldiery of the North. But there is too much love for fine writing and
grandiloquence in America to make the stern Secretary's reproof very
effectual. We do not suppose that, in the present state of the
American mind, any expressions of English admiration for the gallantry
of the Federals will be received with favour; but we may put on
record, to be read when all ill-feeling shall have subsided, that,
apart from the satisfaction felt in England at any success obtained
against the advocates of slavery, we are proud of the bravery of our
cousins, and are ready to recognise in the endurance which they have
displayed under trying circumstances an evidence that their
relationship to the conquerors in the Crimea, India, and China, is
more real than many will allow, We shall, of course, be told that
these sentiments are curiously coincident with the success which is
said, unfairly, to be the idol of England; but we will bear that,
simply remarking that we have nothing to gain by a Northern triumph,
whereas we might be commercially benefited by the establishment of the
South.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE WASHOE MINING REGION.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> recently-organised territory of
Nevada, North America, besides containing the beautiful Carson Valley,
has been rendered famous by being the seat of the Washoe silver-mines, the fame of whose riches drew, it will be remembered, a year
or two ago, swarms of hardy adventurers from even the golden regions
of California to the spot. This region, running north and south, lies
between the nearly parallel ranges of the Sierra Nevada on the
Californian side and the Humboldt range on the side of Utah. As the
most conflicting statements have been made respecting the Washoe
silver-mines, some holding them up to derision and others enduing them
with the halo of extravagant expectations, a few graphic sketches of
its principal mining-places will not be unwelcome to our
readers. Mr. Edward Vischer, who has forwarded to us the accompanying
Illustrations,with many others, is a merchant, of San Francisco,
California, in which State he has lived many years. Practically
acquainted with mining pursuits, and not being personally interested
in Washoe or in mining operations of any kind, his views of the silver
region in Nevada, herewith given, may be taken as trustworthy:&#x2014;" The
early feverish speculative excitement with regard to the Washoe
region, which as an inheritance of 1859 passed undiminished to its
successor, threatening California with a new mania of emigration like
that of the memorable Fraser River, has been checked just in time to
prevent more serious mischief and the ruin of many of our business
men. This was but the disappointment corresponding to silly
exaggeration, the whole region east of the Sierra Nevada being fancied
a ready-made new Potosi without the trouble of even opening a mine. It
was, however, suddenly brought to a climax by the outbreak of
hostilities with the Indians, which could only be terminated by
military aid. Thus the new mining region, hitherto decked out with the
fanciful radiance of the wildest imagination, was all at once reduced
to the reality of mining in a remote wilderness; and it was then
discovered that mining for silver, here as anywhere else, requires
time and capital for the development of its returns. However, should
the mines hitherto opened be the only ones, even precluding the hope
of a further extension of the promising field for mining, their
successful working would be of incalculable benefit for California,
which for a long while will have to furnish all the supply of
necessaries and look to the opening of a rear country as the only true
lever by which she may ultimately obtain a Pacific railroad. As to the
realities of the new silver region, we wonder so little should be
known about them; a quarter of a century will be a more appropriate
term, when the millions of Washoe silver feeding the channels of an
enlarged Asiatic trade may (by a reversing scale, telling of our
advancement), bear a comparison with our lessened gold remittances
vi&#xE2; Panama to Europe." After enumerating the principal leads,
the produce of the mines already opened, and the reducing-works
established or in course of erection, he alludes to visionary
speculation in Washoe mining works, "This," he continues, "is the
fictitious side of Washoe mining&#x2014;the vapoury atmosphere which
surrounds the new silver region. Its mirages no longer delude the
thinking portion of our community. It is fortunate, indeed, that our
public has at so early a stage had a salutary warning by previous
disenchantment. In the meanwhile, the energetic spirit of practical
enterprise, by a combination of technical and financial resources, is
gradually but steadily developing the colossal wealth of the new
silver region, the discovery of which is the fruit of the adventurous
turn of our prospectors, who, with almost superhuman exertions, and
mostly with little benefit to themselves, have been the hardy pioneers
of this new Potosi beyond the Sierra Nevada."</p>

<p>Mr. Vischer has since had the opportunity, by a visit to the Washoe
region, in May of last year, for the sake of personal information, to
confirm him in his opinion that the time has not arrived for justly
estimating the financial importance of the discoveries in Western
Utah, albeit their development, even thus far, has proved a main lever
for the progress of California, whence most of the necessities of the
new silver region have to be supplied. It has, moreover, established
the claim of that region beyond the Sierra Nevada (now known as
"Nevada Territory," since its separation from Utah and Mormon
influences) to the birth of a new and promising community

 in barren
wastes apparently unfit for cultivation and the subsistence of
&amp; permanent population, the outposts of which, however, by the
progress of prospecting and actual mining enterprise, already extend
to the Humboldt range of mountains, bordering on the Great Basin, with
every probability of soon connecting the Washoe region with Salt lake
through a continued line of settlements; the telegraph and overland
mail stations, with the increasing traffic of Western emigration
serving as preparatory links of this phenomenon in the progress of
civilisation.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in a quite recent visit to Washoe, the
writer witnessed the extraordinary start which has taken place within
the last few months, with many cases of individual success; the
gradual development of many a new mining district, and the improved
methods introduced, with works on a gigantic scale multiplying the
chances for a yield in precious metals, which cannot fail to assert
its weight in the financial scales of the world.</p>

<p>But we return to our immediate object, that of giving some particulars  relating to the Illustrations now presented to our readers.</p>

<p rend="center">THE ENGRAVINGS.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Devil's Gate</hi>, some three miles up the
Gulch of Gold Cannon, is a remarkable cluster of rocks on each side, forming a natural gateway and appropriate entrance to this demoniac region. To the south of it, extending about half a mile down the Gulch, lies Silver City, with a population of some two thousand inhabitants; a place teeming with the activity of the entire traffic from California to Washoe.
Numerous teams are constantly occupied in the transportation of ore
from the mines to the crushing-mills (two of the principal of which
are represented in our Engraving; and the noise of some 500 stampers
and snorting of steam-engines render it a fit abode for the Cyclops.
The summit of the rock, forming the right side of the gate, at the time
of the late Indian troubles, was used as a fortification against the
Pah-Utes.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Gold-hill, Mount Davidson, and the
Ophir-road.</hi>&#x2014;Following the ascent of the Cannon for about two and
a half miles beyond the Devil's Gate, northerly, we arrive at the
famous Gold-hill, the paying-place, par excellence, of the Washoe
region, as the produce of its mines, less remarkable for its positive
richness than the continuity of a steady average yield of from 50 to
75 dols. to the ton, chiefly in gold of easy extraction, enters into
immediate circulation. Its bountiful yield of such ore is practically
evinced by the uninterrupted line of heavy teams carrying the precious
rock to the mills of Silver City and on Carson River, the works
established in the vicinity of Gold-hill being insufficient even for
the requirements of the companies which erected and work them for their
own use. The alloy of silver, hitherto disregarded, is increasing at a
rate which will imply a more complicated process, and retard the
result. This hill, perforated by numerous tunnels, with its stir of
life, resembles a vast beehive; and the airy scaffolding of the
schuyts for delivering the rock surround it as with the tracery of
some huge spider's web. The entire frontage of Gold-hill proper does
not exceed 250 yards, this space being subdivided into numerous claims
of from 5ft. to 10ft. each, worked by a few men. Individual mining,
therefore, is the prevailing feature in this locality; and the
consequence is a certain recklessness in pushing into the paying
ledge as fast as possible, with a frequent disregard of the safety of
support among tunnels in danger of "caving in."</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Virginia City.</hi>&#x2014;This Illustration (on page 259) represents the first
glimpse afforded of this emporium of Washoe, from the eminence at
the head of Gold Cannon, beyond Gold-hill, the distance between these
two places being only about one English mile. The plain abounds in
detached boulders of rock as fantastic in form as those of Arabia
Petrea, the comparison being borne out by the general aspect of the
surrounding country. Immediately beyond Mount Davidson, to the left,
is Cedar-hill, the site of extensive prospecting and tunnel
operations. The Comstock lead, renowned for its richness, commences on

Sketches in connection with General Burnside's expedition to the coast
of North Carolina, two of which are engraved on page 258. He writes
respecting them as follows:&#x2014;"On the first appearance of fine weather I
landed on the desolate sands of Hatteras Spit, and started for an
island some five miles up, the coast of which was covered with cedars
and oaks. Here I made the two Sketches forwarded with this letter. One
shows the provisional camp of a portion of the Burnside expedition who
have landed temporarily, and the other gives the head-quarters at Camp
Winfield of General Williams, who commands the troops that have been in occupation of the place since the capture of the forts."</p>

<p rend="center">CAPTURE OF FORT DONNELSON.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> pressure of the immense force organised by
the Federal Government of America begins at length to tell upon the
Southern Confederacy. Several minor successes in the south-west have
culminated in the capture of Fort Donnelson, with nearly its whole
garrison, armament, ammunition, and stores. General Floyd, it is true,
with 5000 men, escaped during the night preceding the surrender,
otherwise the victory was complete. The Confederates have abandoned
the important strategical position which they held at Bowling
Green. Nashville, the seat of the Southern Government, appeared by the
last advices received before writing the remarks which follow to be in
imminent danger. Possibly, news of its having fallen into the
possession of the Northern troops may reach this country before the
issue of the present Number of our Journal, and, whenever it does, the
relation of the Border States to the great struggle between the North
and the South will have been virtually determined. Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Missouri will have been recovered for the Union. The
army which has so long covered Manassas Gap will be exposed to be taken in the rear, and must retire.General M'Clellan will be able to clear Virginia, and Secession
will be shut up in the Gulf States, the Slave States proper, to fight for endurable terms of submission, or to hold out to the last for independence.</p>

<p>From the day when the boom of the first cannon fired in this
war swept over the surface of the Charleston waters, the part to be
taken in it by the four great Border States was looked for by both
parties with intense anxiety. In each of them the interests and
opinions of the population were known to be divided between North and
South; and probably each, could it have resisted external influence,
would have preferred to occupy a neutral position, and, by interposing
between the extreme parties on both sides, to have ultimately effected
a reconciliation. Secessionists, however, at the outbreak of the civil
war, held in their hands in all the States the machinery of
government, both legislative and executive, and, by a prompt,
energetic, and lawless use of the means at their command, succeeded in
tearing them away from the Union, and placing much of their real and
more of their apparent strength at the disposal of President
Davis. The moral effect of this successful stratagem, especially upon
the people and armies of the South, has, no doubt, been
prodigious. But it was far easier to suppress for a 
period all show of sentiment in favour of the Union than to annihilate
it. It has already asserted its right to be heard. In various places
it has snatched up the weapons readiest to its hand, and done battle,
in a sort of guerrilla fashion, with the usurpation, that would have
crushed it out of existence. Assuming that General Halleck will
complete the work he has so successfully commenced, he will liberate
from the forced pressure put upon it by the Secessionists the whole
amount of loyal sentiment diffused through the Border States, and,
from being held in abeyance, it will become dominant. To all present
intents and purposes the triumph of his arms will immediately restore
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri to the Union, and will thereby
render Virginia untenable much longer by the Confederates.</p>

<p>The Southern army, which occupies so strong a position at Manassas,
and which has hitherto kept General M'Clellan and the army of the
Potomac at bay, can be safe where it is only so long as it has free
communication with the country behind it. A command of the railroads
which traverse that vast area, and by which its supplies and
reinforcements have hitherto been forwarded, is absolutely essential
to it. The importance,<pb n="264"/>
therefore, of holding the several centres where these railroads
converge on their way to the north-east was seen at an early period
of the struggle, and wherever they have been menaced they have been
guarded by strong bodies of Confederate troops. It is this
circumstance which invests the capture of Fort Donnelson with so much
interest. It constituted a base for that division of the Southern
army the main business of which was to keep open the communications
which connected the army in Virginia with every part of the seceded
States. But, should the expedition which has recently seized Edenton,
Elizabeth city, and Hertford gain possession of the line between
Charleston and Savannah, and General Halleck, as seems most probable,
obtain command over the junctions at Bowling Green and Nashville,
President Davis or General Beauregard, or whoever presides over the
military force in Virginia, will probably find it necessary, unless he
would run the risk of being starved out or hemmed in, to beat a
retreat from Manassas, and leave the Northern Generals, including
M'Clellan, to close round the Gulf States, and stamp out, meanwhile,
the embers of civil war in the great Border States. Should they effect
thus much -before the close of the spring season, they will have done
all that can be reasonably expected of them, and the question at
-issue between the two parties will be immensely narrowed.</p>

<p>Such a consummation will put the North into a fair position to consider whether an indefinite prolongation of the contest, with a view to subjugate the Slave States, will be worth the immense suffering and expense which, in the event of their refusing to give up their independence, the attempt to force it from them will inevitably entail. The recovery of the
Border States will enable the Government at Washington to put an end
to the war on terms at once honourable and advantageous&#x2014;terms,
moreover, which would relieve it from the responsibility of dealing
with the difficult question of slavery. But we fear that this
termination of the struggle is not to be hoped for, at least for the
present. Possibly, too, it is only our ignorance of the real temper of
the South which permits us to wish for it. It may turn out, after all,
that Secession has been mainly the work of ambitious and disappointed
politicians, whose objects, in the hour of misfortune, the majority of
the population, even in the Slave States, will decline to further to
the ruin of all their material interests and prospects. At any rate,
whether the Confederacy shall once more be merged in the Union, or
shall succeed in establishing an independent Republic, one thing seems tolerably clear, and in this we rejoice, that the roots of the slave system will have
been cut up for ever.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Cunard steamer Asia we have news from New
York to the afternoon of the 26th ult. The movements of the Federal 
forces on the Cumberland River continue to form the most important
feature of the week's news.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OCCUPATION OF NASHVILLE.</p>
<p>Clarksville was occupied on the 20th by the Federal forces. Two-thirds of the inhabitants fled. Commodore Foote issued a proclamation assuring all peaceably-disposed persons that they might resume their usual occupations, provided that they gave up all military stores and equipments in their possession.</p>

<p>Pushing forward, the Federal troops on the 24th occupied Nashville,
the capital of Tennessee and one of the most important manufacturing
cities of the Confederate States. General Buell entered the city
without resistance at the head of 10,000 troops and hoisted the stars
and stripes over the State House. The Confederates, under General
Beauregard, had retired to Murfreesboro', an inland place about thirty miles south of Nashville, where the Federals will not have the advantage of their gun-boats. The Tennessee Legislature had adjourned to Memphis.</p>

<p rend="center">LOSSES AT FORT DONNELSON.</p>
<p>The official returns show 321 killed, 1050 wounded, and 150 missing
on the Federal side. The prisoners taken by them number, not 15,000, but 3,300. They have been taken to Chicago and St. Louis.</p>

<p rend="center">OPERATIONS IN KENTUCKY AND ARKANSAS.</p>

<p>In Eastern Kentucky the Federals have occupied Cumberland Gap.
In Arkansas General Price was defeated at Sugar Creek, and fled,
leaving many prisoners and arms in the hands of the victors. General
Halleck has issued an order forbidding the stealing or concealing
fugitive slaves, assigning as a reason the urgent necessity of proving
to the Southern people that the Federals are fighting for the Constitution and the Union, and not for emancipation.</p>

<p rend="center">OPERATIONS ON THE SEACOAST.</p>

<p>Burnside's expedition has burnt Winton, on the Chowau River. No
landing was effected, on account of the presence of a large Confederate force.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>The Confederate Congress assembled at Richmond on the 18th ult.  On
the following day the electoral votes of the eleven States which voted
for President and Vice-President were counted. The total number was
109, and they were all given for Mr. Davis as President and Mr.
Stephens as Vice-President. The inauguration ceremonies took place at
Richmond on the 22nd ult., Washington's birthday. Mr. Davis then
delivered his inaugural address. He complains of "the malignity and
barbarity of the Northern States in the prosecution of the existing
war." While, he says, every guarantee of personal freedom has been
swept away in the North, in the Confederate States no act has been
done to impair personal liberty or the freedom of speech, of thought,
or of the press. He acknowledges that the "tide for the moment is
against us, but the final result in our favour is not doubtful." He
thinks the North "must sink under the immense load of debt which they

have<pb n="265"/> incurred." After lauding the noble spirit of
patriotism which animates men, women, and children in the South, he
predicts the sacrifices it imposes will be an enduring bond of
harmony among the people. The blockade is making them a
self-supporting people.  "After a series of successes and victories
which covered our arms with glory, we have recently met with serious
disasters. But in the heart of a people resolved to be free these
disasters tend but to stimulate to increased resistance." He concludes
with a solemn invocation of the Deity.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis had appointed the 28th ult. as a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer throughout the Confederate States.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The youngest son of the President, aged eleven years, has died at the White House.</p>

<p>The President has signed the Treasury Note Bill. In its final shape it provided for the payment in coin of the interest on the public debt, and as security therefore stipulated that the customs duties should be payable in specie only.</p>

<p>The President has taken military possession of all the telegraph lines, and military supervisors of messages have been appointed.</p>

<p>The Senate, by a vote of 29 to 9, has thrown out the State Department's project of a treaty for guaranteeing the payment of the Mexican debt for five years. General Scott's name was submitted as Commissioner to Mexico to procure the ratification of this now defeated project of a treaty.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Washington's birthday (Feb. 22) was celebrated with more than ordinary enthusiasm throughout the Free States. Mr. Forney read Washington's farewell address in the great hall of the House of Representatives. In New York the historian Bancroft was the orator of the day.</p>

<p>The British screw-steamer Stella had been chartered to convey American contributions to the International Exhibition.</p>

<p>The journals comment favourably on the speeches made at the opening
of Parliament, but the Mexican expedition is more freely and generally
denounced than before, especially that part of it which includes the
elevation of a European Prince to the throne of Mexico.</p>

<p>The barque Ariel had been captured off Providence on suspicion of
being intended for the slave trade.</p>

<p>The condemned slave captain, Gordon, suffered the extreme penalty
of the law in New York on the 21st ult. The wretched man took
strychnine the night previous, but by copious draughts of whisky he
was kept alive until the hour of execution. The New York journals give
highly-coloured accounts of the scene. Gordon was the first person
ever hanged in the United Slates for participation in the slave
trade.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL
NEWS.</hi><lb/>AMERICA.<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">Belligerent Operations By Sea and Land</hi></p>

<p> The Montreal Company's steamer Hibernian brings news to
the 8th instant. The Government allows hardly any news of the
movements of the army and navy to transpire for publication. Columbus,
the last point held in Kentucky by the Confederates, has been
abandoned. The Confederates carried away their stores and artillery,
and burnt their barracks, but spared the town. It was immediately afterwards occupied by the Federals.</p>

<p>In Tennessee the Federals have advanced to Murfreesboro', from
which the Confederates, under General Sidney Johnson, retreated to
Decatur, a town on the Tennessee River, in Northern Alabama, the report that the Confederates were surrounded at Murfreesboro' by General Buell being unfounded. It is admitted that the people of Nashville show no sympathy for the Union troops, and studiously avoid all intercourse with them. The Mayor had issued a proclamation assuring the citizens that General Buell was desirous that industry should resume its course, and urging the country people to bring in their supplies to the Federal troops, who would remunerate them for the same. The Federal mails now run to Nashville. Andrew Johnson, the loyal senator from East Tennessee, has been appointed by the President Provisional Governor of the State. He will repair to Nashville to organise a loyal State Government there.</p>

<p>The Confederates, on evacuating Mudtown, in Arkansas, poisoned
the provisions they were obliged to abandon. On entering the village
the hungry Federals ate of the same, and died to the number of forty-two officers and men.</p>

<p>General Banks's division on the Upper Potomac had crossed that river without resistance, and the main body of the Federals had moved forward, but a heavy fall of snow has put a stop to any further advance for the present.</p>

<p>In Western Virginia General Lander had breathed his last. He died
 from over exertion and the effects of a wound in the leg received at
 Edward's Ferry. General Shields has been appointed his successor.</p>

<p>The expeditions on the coast line are heard of at two
points. General Burnside is threatening the town of Suffolk, in the
south-east corner of Virginia. The troops of the Port Royal expedition
were within seven miles of Savannah, where they are confronted by a force of Confederates. An obstruction of timber-rafts has been placed across the river to keep the Union gun-boats at bay.</p>

<p>From the blockading squadrons we have to report several items. A
British steamer, Labuan, has been taken in Mexican waters, under
circumstances likely to give rise to diplomatic correspondence. The
Labuan has been taken into New York, while her captain is on his way
to Washington to lay the case before Lord Lyons. The steamer was
loading with cotton at Metamoras, a Mexican port, and the charge made is that she was engaged in trade with the Texan port on the
opposite side of the Rio Grande.</p>

<p>The Federal steamer South Carolina captured the Confederate
steamer Magnolia while attempting to run out of Mobile with a cargo of 400 bales of cotton. The engineer attempted to blow her up, but only succeeded in killing himself.</p>

<p>The steamer Nashville, after coaling at the Bermudas, has arrived
safely at Wilmington, North Carolina. She approached the blockading vessel with the Union flag flying. After passing her she raised the Confederate flag and moved towards Fort Macon. The blockading vessel having discovered the deception gave chase, following her within range of the guns of the fort, but did her no damage.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis has sent another message to Congress. He admits that
"the Government had attempted more than it had power successfully to achieve." The effort to protect the whole territory of the Confederacy, seaboard and inland, had brought on them serious disasters. After reciting the difficulties of procuring the means of defence under which the Government laboured, and the absence of a navy, he speaks of the surrender of Roanoke Island as "deeply humiliating." Of the capitulation at Fort Donnelson he says he is "not only unwilling but unable to believe that a large army of our people have surrendered without a desperate effort to cut its way through the investing forces whatever may have been their numbers." He thinks that bitter disappointments will nerve the people to still greater exertions. He blames the policy of enlistments for short terms, and says that the quotes called for from the different States will soon be ready. The numbers in the field are 400 regiments of infantry, with proportionate cavalry and artillery. The total expenditure of the Government for the year has been only 175,000,000 dols., less than one-third of the expenditure of the enemy.</p>

<p>Congress has passed a resolution recommending the military commanders to destroy all tobacco and cotton, to prevent its falling into
the enemy's hands; and another, by a unanimous vote, that the existing war be prosecuted until the enemy shall be expelled from every foot of soil within each of the Confederate States, and that no proposition of peace contemplating any other result be listened to.</p>

<p>Richmond <sic corr="has">nas</sic> been put under martial law by President Davis, and
a society of Union men, consisting chiefly of Germans, has been arrested. Gold is at 40 to 50 per cent premium.</p>

<p>The Governor of Georgia has called for 13,000 troops by the 4th of March. If not raised by that time, draughting would follow.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln has sent a message to Congress recommending that body
to pass a joint resolution offering to purchase the freedom of the
slaves in any State willing to emancipate on these conditions. The
message does not propose any forcible interference with any Slave
State, and the President thinks that only the border Slave States are
likely to entertain the subject; but he thinks that if these States
were detached from the other Slave States the rebellion would be at an
end, as it is only buoyed up by the hope of erecting a great empire
consisting of all the now Slave States. The message concludes with a
vague threat:&#x2014;"If resistance continues, war must continue, and it is impossible to foresee all the incidents which may follow it. Such means as may seem indispensable or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle must and will come."</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives, on the 3rd inst., the Chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means produced the long-expected tax
bill. Its promoters estimate that it will produce 100,000,000 dols. It
includes duties on spirituous and malt liquors, tobacco and cigars,
oils, gas, paper, advertisements, soap, salt, ginger, pepper, and
leather. Flour is taxed ten cents the barrel. Railroad, steam-boat,
omnibus, and horse-railroad passengers are threatened with a
mulct. Carriages, watches, gold and silver plate, and billiard-tables
are included in another series of clauses. Slaughtered cattle, hogs,
and sheep constitute another category. Then follow
licence taxes for a large number of trades and occupations,
from a banker taxed 100 dols. to a photographer taxed 10 dols. per
annum. The income tax of 3 per cent is extended to all incomes over
600 dols. The dividends of railroad and bank stock are taxed 3 per
cent, so are Government salaries. A legacy duty on the personal
property of deceased persons of from 1 to 5 per cent is to be levied,
and the bill winds up with stamp duties on all kinds of legal and
commercial papers, all patent medicines, telegraph messages, and goods
by express. In other respects the proceedings of Congress have been
unimportant.</p><pb n="281"/>

<p>Mr. Seward has discontinued the passport system which he created a
few months ago. He has also written a letter to a club of his admirers in Philadelphia declaring that he will not be a candidate at the next Presidential election.</p>

<p>The house of M. Mercier, the French Ambassador, was burnt to the
ground on the night of the 5th inst., and all the papers of the embassy destroyed.</p>

<p rend="center">NEW YORK.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce of this city has passed resolutions complimenting Mr. Bright for his friendly attitude towards the United States.</p>

<p>The British steamer Stella left New York on the 25th ult., with the
chief part of the American contributions to the World's Fair. These
were about 500 parcels weighing in the aggregate nearly 150 tons, and comprising a great variety of ingenious and useful inventions.</p>

<p rend="center">OBITUARY.</p>

<p>Professor Felton, President of Harvard University, died on the 26th
ult., at Chester, Pennsylvania. He was in his fifty-fifth year, and was
generally esteemed the first Greek scholar in the United
States.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MARCH</hi> 22, 1862</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> important news has been received that President Lincoln, in his
Message to Congress, has proposed to build "a golden bridge for a
flying enemy." He recommends that the North should offer to co-operate
with the Slave States for the gradual emancipation of the slaves by
pecuniary compensation, leaving it to each State, however, to retain
the system of slavery or not, as it may please. The President's effort
is directed to secure the Border States, which he thinks may choose to
go with the South in the event of the independence of the latter being
recognised. The proposal seems significant, as it would imply that the
President, though at present refusing to see anything but a rebellion
which the sword is to put down, may not have been able to resist the
conviction that certain portions of what was the Union will never be
recovered to it. He would, therefore, do the best he can towards
consolidating the rest. It is premature to pronounce upon the wisdom
of promulgating this plan, because such wisdom, or its absence, can
only be inferred from the effect of the announcement upon the popular
mind; but in one sense it may be permitted to Englishmen to applaud
it, inasmuch as it is another blow at the system of slavery. It is
something to have that system thus pointed out by the Chief Magistrate
of the Northern States as the<hi rend="italic"> teterrima causa</hi>
of revolt and anarchy. We hear of no response from the South; but by a
very narrow majority, 77 to 71, the Southern House of Representatives
recommend the military commanders to destroy all tobacco and cotton
rather than let either fall into the enemy's hands. The<hi rend="italic"> Herald</hi>, the hired organ of the slaveowners, and
only Federalist under dread of long rope and short shrift, rather
approves the President's proposal, but cannot have had time to receive
final orders. The<hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> strongly approves it. We have no war news, save that the surrender of Nashville and of Columbus is certain, and that the genius of M'Clellan is again being acknowledged by his patient and sapient critics, who now see the two wings of the eagle flapping over the prey that awaits the blow of the beak&#x2014;Anglic&#xE8;, the advance of the central army. It is stated that Mr. Seward intends to announce the intention of the North to resist the establishment of a monarchy in Mexico.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL VICTORY AT ROANOKE ISLAND.<lb/><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington</hi>, Feb. 28.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> last the tide of fortune has turned in
favour of the North, and the success attending the formidable
preparations of the past six months is now recompensing the
Federalists for the enormous expenditure which has weighed heavily
upon them. In former letters I have had occasion to notice the
improvement in the discipline of the Union Army, which has been
gradually progressing towards a state of efficiency under the
guidance and supervision of the new Commander-in-Chief. To brigade
regiments, form divisions, and appoint divisional generals, were among
the first tasks which M'Cllellan set himself to accomplish; and,
having succeeded in these, he published a series of general orders for
the better regulation and conduct of military matters, and providing
for a more thorough and perfect state of discipline through every
branch of the service. The consequence is, that during all these
apparently idle months the soldier's taskmaster, the drill-sergeant,
has been abroad, and now as the time approaches for action the Federal Government finds it has an army to rely on for support or vindication, astounding in its numbers as the growth of only nine months, and wonderfully efficient considering the short period it has been in the field. The combinations
of the General-in-Chief are now being seen and understood, and those
who have arraigned him in judgment before the court of their
displeasure are now compelled to acknowledge their error, confuted by
the successes that have inaugurated the first part of a new
campaign. The victories in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Tennessee,
have dealt a staggering blow at secession; while the Federal troops,
hitherto depressed by their early discomfitures, are now elated and
confident, placing implicit reliance in their General, and being eager
to carry the flag of the Union into the heart of Secessia. I am no
"Sir Oracle," so I will not attempt to prophesy a triumph for the
Federalists; but, seeing the improved condition in the morale of the
Union forces, and feeling somewhat competent to give an opinion, I am
inclined to believe that these first successes are not to be their
last. I have watched the Northern army almost from its first appearance
in the field. I have seen it a stripling, and known it in its
hobedeyhoyhood the prey of bullying politicians, who by their
pernicious counsels are responsible for its earliest defeats. I now see it arrived at man's estate, and it should or ought to achieve for itself an honorable future.</p>

 <p>My last letter was dated from Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, on
the eve of the departure of the expedition to which I was attached
to attack Roanoke Island. The rumours of an impending advance of the army of the Potomac and the distant sounds of victory from the west reached us even there, and I determined, immediately Roanoke was taken, to hasten back to head-quarters, ready to witness what must be the most decisive and important movement of the campaign&#x2014;the attack on the Confederate centre at Manassas. And here I am, after a delay of some days, caused by the prevalence of fearful storms on the coast, heartily sick of combined naval and military expeditions, and thoroughly determined to have nothing more to do with them, unless I can first of all make a satisfactory arrangement with the clerk of the weather.</p>

<p>The telegraphic accounts of the success of General Burnside reached

New York, and thence were dispatched to England long before I could send you sketches in connection with the capture of Roanoke, so I will not attempt to give any elaborate details, and will simply confine myself to a brief description of the incidents which form the subjects illustrated by my pencil.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th the fleet of transports and gun-boats
which had lain off the entrance of Crotan Sound during the previous
night weighed anchor, the latter forming into line of battle in three
divisions. The entrance into Crotan Sound is by a narrow channel
scarcely more then one hundred feet in width, the navigation of which
is exceedingly difficult, as a sandbar lies immediately off the
mouth. However, the entire fleet, with one exception, were safely
through by 10 a.m., and at half-past the first gun was fired from the
Confederate battery, evidently as a signal of some kind or other. The
mainland of North Carolina lay on our left, and this we had to hug
closely for two miles or so, the deep water running there. Every
moment I expected to see a puff of white smoke followed by a whiz come
from among the tall brakes on the bank, but for some reason or other
the Confederates had neglected placing a battery here, which appears
to me the more astonishing from the fact that at any time during this
two miles I could have almost thrown a biscuit on shore. After the
above distance the channel made a curve to the right towards Roanoke,
passing under the guns of the first fort and continuing along the
sands to the extreme point of the island, with two other forts
commanding it at equal distances from the first, they being so
arranged that a cross fire could be brought to bear on vessels
attempting to force their way through. Between the first and second
forts lay the Confederate steamers, seven in number, and the action
was commenced at long range between them and the Federal gun-boats as
the latter advanced steadily in line to the attack. At half-past
eleven Fort Bartow chimed in as the Federal squadron came within its
range, and it was now that the Spalding, on board which ship I was,
with the General and his Staff, opened fire from her rifled
Parrott. In a few minutes the plan of the action was somewhat changed,
the Confederate steamers retiring behind some obstructions placed in
the channel, and moving up towards the entrance to Albemarle Sound,
evidently with the purpose of drawing a portion of the Union vessels
through the narrow opening left, and immediately under the guns of the
second fort. This was seen and understood by Commodore Gouldsborough, who detached half a dozen of his boats to block their passage back again, and to engage them as nearly as the obstructions in the channel would admit. This is the period of the action I have chosen for one of my Sketches (engraved on the preceding page). About two p.m. the Confederate fleet retired out of range, the largest vessel, the Curlew, being so damaged that they had to run her ashore under the shelter of a battery near the upper point of the main land to prevent her sinking. She was afterwards burnt by her crew, and the battery blown up to prevent it falling into the hands of the Federalists. At 3 p.m. the troops commenced landing, protected by the guns of the Picket and Delaware, who shelled from amongst the pines the force that had been drawn up to oppose the debarkation. At six the firing ceased between the Federal gun-boats and Fort Bartow, and by midnight upwards of 9000 men had been safely put on shore without accident.</p>

 <p>The difficulties the troops had to contend against in landing were
 great, the place chosen being a perfect swamp, which extended inland
 a distance of a quarter of a mile, and in which the men sank to their
 knees and waists. To make matters more uncomfortable, a thin cold
 rain fell throughout the night, the soldiers having no other shelter
 than what they stood in, and many of them were completely benumbed by
 daylight. Nothing disturbed the stillness of the dark hours save one
 solitary report of a gun which heralded the death of a
 Massachusetts soldier who was thrown out in the forest as a picket:
 this was the only collision that occurred during the night. There was
 something peculiarly impressive in the gloom of the dark pine woods with the knowledge that perhaps within a dozen yards lurked the enemy, and that
at any moment the watcher might be sent to his last account.</p>

<p>Day broke cold, damp, and miserable; and, after a drink of water and
a biscuit each men, the Federal force prepared to advance into the
interior, following a path which led to the main artery running
through the island. About ten the first collision took place between the
opposing forces, at the point where the pathway alluded to above
intersects the main road. Foster's brigade was the first to move
forward, and he deployed his men to the right of the road in the
woods, engaging the enemy's skirmishers as he felt his way step by
step through the breast-high swamp. I followed this force. General
Reno then occupied the road with his brigade, forming the centre,
while General Parke forced an opening through the roads and swamps on
the left contending against the same difficulties that Foster and his
men were encountering on the right. General Burnside directed the
whole of the movements. From the cross road to the clearing in which
the Confederates had three guns in a fieldwork, there was a continuous
rattle of musketry, the fire from the concealed Secessionist
skirmishers cutting up the Union men severely; in fact, even I, who
you may be sure kept in pretty safe place, heard the bullets humming
round as though a beehive had been overturned in the neighbourhood. At
midday the clearing was reached by the head of Reno's column, and its
appearance was saluted by roundshot and grape from the fieldwork
already mentioned. Daring this time Foster and Parke were each pushing
on through immense obstacles to outflank the battery, the latter
getting up two of his regiments first, the 9th New 
York, or Hawkins's Zouaves, and the 21st Massachusetts. General
Parke, immediately he reached the flank of the breastwork, ordered the
above two regiments to charge, which they did in the most brilliant
manner, dashing through the swamp and over the stumps of the
pine-clearing, and into the battery which the Confederates were
hastily leaving. One officer alone, Lieutenant Selden, of the Richmond
Blues, remained to dispute its possession. In my sketch (engraved on
page 298) he is seen falling back from the parapet, dying as a gallant
soldier should, with his face to the enemy. All could see him to the
very last proud and erect, waving his sword and encouraging the men to
stand. But his example was lost upon them, their panic was complete,
and Lieutenant Selden, whose gallantry had been unavailing, I saw laid
carefully in a sheltered spot ten minutes after he fell. The
Confederates now retreated to the upper portion of the island, hastily
pursued by Reno, who had with him but a small portion of his
force. Foster also passed on with his men towards the rear of the
water battery that had engaged the gun-boats throughout the previous
day, and, coming upon an intersecting path that led to it, he ordered
the 4th Rhode Islanders to advance at the double and take it, which
they proceeded to do with a deafening cheer. On rushing into the works
they found, to their astonishment, the place deserted and guns
spiked. The garrison, hearing of the defeat of their force in the
centre of the island, and foreseeing an attack in the rear, had
evacuated the place and retired in the sane direction as their beaten
comrades. At Camp Georgia the entire Confederate force that had not
succeeded in making its escape by way of Nag's Head was come up with
by General Reno, and, after firing a few shots, they surrendered in a
mass, numbering nearly 3000 all told, 1500 having got across Roanoke
and retired to Currituck with old General Wise, whose son was killed
in the engagement at the fieldwork. Thus was Roanoke Island captured
by the Federalists, their success giving them the command of all the
inland waters of North Carolina, and a capital basis for operations on
the mainland, which will be commenced immediately. The entire loss of
the Unionists does not exceed 260 killed and wounded, though had the
Confederates shown anything like a fight at their fieldwork the number
might have been quadrupled. I am inclined to think that the latter, with 4500 men and their strong natural positions, should have held at bay the Federal force brought against them: but more" kudos," therefore, is to be allowed the victors.</p>

 <p>With regard to the sentiment of the people on the island, it appears
to me to be quite as much one way as the other. I think all they want
is to be let alone by both parties. The following were more especially
the sentiments of a Mr. Jarvis, farmer and fisherman, whose house had
been taken possession of by the Zouaves; he was a perfectly bewildered
individual. His family was in one of the negro shanties, and he was
outside, mourning over the events of the day. He had "nothing agin the
North," and had sold a great many shad to go there. But the troops had
killed one of his pigs, and his wife had lost her temper and her flat
irons. "Do you own any negroes, Mr. Jarvis ?" queried I, "Well, I <hi rend="italic">did</hi>, but three of 'em went to Hatteras last week, two more have run away, I don't know where, and there's one in the kitchen I'll give away if anybody wants him !" It was a clear case of unmistakable collapse. He was assured by one of the Staff who was present, that his remaining property should be protected, and that all deficiencies should be made good if he was loyal.</p>

<p>I shall now send you some interesting subjects of the difficulties
of transport, and the cause of the delay in the advance of the army of
the Potomac, owing, as it is, entirely to the dreadful state of the
Virginia roads. The first sign of dry weather will be hailed with
delight by the men, who know they are to move from the camps where they have passed six months of monotonous existence. <hi rend="right">F. V.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Cunard steamer Arabia we have received New
York journals to the 12th inst. The news is of more than usual interest.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT, OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th instant the much-talked-of iron-plated
steam-ship Merrimac and the Confederate steamers Yorktown and
Jamestown left Norfolk and attacked the Federal sailing-frigates
Cumberland and Congress at the mouth of James River. The Merrimac
received the broadsides of the Cumberland and Congress at one hundred
yards without sustaining any damage. The Merrimac then ran into the
Cumberland with her iron prow, literally laying open her sides. She
then drew off, fired a broadside into the Cumberland, and again ran
into her, knocking in her side, and left her to sink. The Congress,
which had kept up a brisk engagement with the Yorktown and Jamestown,
then surrendered. The officers and marines were taken prisoners, but
the men were ordered to take to their boats and run ashore. About 150
of the crew of the Cumberland were drowned, and about 50 on board the
Congress were killed. The Federal frigates Minnesota and St. Lawrence
were being towed to the assistance of the Cumberland and Congress when
the Minnesota got aground and could render no assistance. The
St. Lawrence, being a sailing-vessel, prudently kept out of the
fight. The Congress was burnt to the water's edge, and two Federal
gunboats, the Oregon and the Zouave, were put hors de combat by the
monster. When this news reached New York it was much feared that the
Merrimac would shortly make her appearance in New York Bay and bombard
the city. The Mayor was urged to sink ballast-laden ships in the
channel to prevent the passage of the enemy. These fears were not
destined to be realised, as, by a piece of great good fortune, the
Federal Ericsson floating-battery Monitor arrived at Fortress Monroe
that same night, and was ready to engage the Merrimac in the
morning. The two vessels fought five hours, during which they nearly
touched each other, the Monitor finally succeeding in forcing a hole
in the port side of the Merrimac, which thereupon retired, with the
rest of the Confederate fleet, to Norfolk, The Monitor was
uninjured. Some of the Federal spectators assert that the Merrimac was
injured, but others dissent from this opinion.</p>

 <p>Commodore Dupont's naval expedition which left Port Royal captured and occupied Brunswick on the Georgian coast. The expedition then proceeded to Cumberland Sound, the entrance to the harbour of Fernandina, Florida, and took possession of Fort Clinch, which the Confederates had evacuated. The Federals captured twelve large guns.</p>

<p>On land the events are equally stirring. The Confederates have
abandoned all their batteries and positions on the Potomac, the navigation of which is now entirely unimpeded, and the long siege to which Washington has been partially subjected has ceased.</p>

<p>A runaway negro brought the news to the Federal camp that the
Confederates were abandoning their intrenched positions and moving
southward. Accordingly, on the 10th, General M'Clellan ordered the
main army to move on towards Centreville and Manassas. The former
place was found deserted. They thence proceeded to Manassas, which the
Confederates had entirely abandoned. The log huts in which they had
been housed were left standing. Piles of bullets and cartridges were
left in the tents, and an immense quantity of quartermaster's
stores. The fields were everywhere silent and deserted, the country
people having fled, and the fortifications were bare and
blackened. All the railway bridges were destroyed and the track torn
up. It is not positively known at what point north of Richmond the
Confederates will make their next stand. General M'Clellan had
established his head-quarters at Fairfax Courthouse. The evacuation of
Manassas by the Confederates had caused great rejoicing through the
Northern States.</p>

<p>From the Upper Potomac we learn that General Banks had occupied Leesburg without opposition.</p>

<p>From Tennessee the news is that the Confederates were about to
make a stand at Chattanooga, a place of great natural strength on the borders of Georgia, and the point of junction of four railroads. General Beauregard's health has improved, and he is said to retain his old confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederate cause.</p>

<p>A Nashville correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Daily
Review</hi>, who dates his letter Feb. 19, gives an inside view of the
condition of the Confederate army in Nashville before its
evacuation. The destitution and suffering, and consequent
demoralisation of the soldiers, are painted as extreme. Without shoes,
with only a single blanket per man, with few tents, drenched with
rain, lying on a muddy swamp, with unfit food and unwholesome water,
they died "without an arm to save or an eye to pity." The condition of
the hospitals is described as "horrible and heartrending." Without
nurses, equipments, medicine, or good food, "misery, hopeless,
unalleviated, was everywhere." Of the cooking department it is written
that it was in such a wretched condition that the food was eaten
nearly raw. It consisted of salt pork, hard bread, hominy, and
rice.</p>

<p>General Halleck officially reports that the Federal army of the
South-west, under General Curtis, had gained a victory, after three
days' hard fighting, at Sugar Creek, Arkansas, over the combined
Confederate forces of Van Dorn, Price, and M'Culloch: guns, flags, and
provisions were captured in large quantities. The Federal cavalry were
pursuing the enemy. The Federal loss is estimated at 1000 killed and
wounded. The enemy's loss is stated to be greater.</p>

<p>The territory of New Mexico has been invaded by the Texans, who
were about to attack the Federals at Fort Craig. The invasion has
caused the indignation of the New Mexicans, and 8000 have been
enrolled to resist the invaders.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has passed a resolution concerning pecuniary compensation to States willing to emancipate their slaves in accordance with Mr. Lincoln's Message by 88 against 31 votes.</p>

<p>The Senate has passed a bill to the effect that no Federal officer or soldier shall return fugitives.</p>

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN IRON-CLAD VESSELS.<lb/>THE MONITOR</p>

<p> is a long, wide, and flat-bottomed vessel, with vertical sides and
pointed ends, requiring but a very shallow depth of water to float in,
though heavily loaded with impregnable armour on her sides and a
bombproof deck, on which is placed a shotproof revolving turret, which
contains two very heavy guns. She is so low In the water as to afford
no target for an enemy, and everything and everybody is below the
waterline with the exception of the persons working the guns, who are
protected by the shotproof turret. The sides of the vessel are first
formed of plate iron, half an inch thick, outside of which is attached
solid white oak 26in. thick, outside of this again is rolled iron
armour 5in. thick. The bombproof deck is supported by heavy braced oak
beams, upon which is laid planking 7in. thick, covered with rolled
plate iron 1in. thick. The turrets consist of a rolled plate iron
skeleton, 1in. thick, to which are riveted two thicknesses of 1in.
each of rolled iron plates. Outside of this again are six plates of
rolled iron, all firmly bolted together, with nuts inside, so that if
a plate is started it can be at once tightened again. The top is
covered with a bombproof roof, perforated with holes. The lower part
of the gun-carriages consists of solid wrought-iron beams. These are
planed perfectly true, and are placed parallel in the turret, both of
the guns pointing in the same direction. The ports in the side of the
tunnel are only large enough to permit the muzzle of the gun to be
thrust through. Inside of them are wrought-iron pendulums, which close
them against the enemy as soon as the gun recoils. She is armed with
two of the largest Dahlgren guns, made to revolve by a pair of steam
engines placed beneath the deck. The lower vessel is of iron,
&#xBD;in. thick, and made in the usual manner.  She carries her
machinery, coal, &amp;c., aft, and forward the officers' quarters,
ammunition, and stores. The two partitions of the vessel are separated
by a wrought-iron bulkhead. The officers' quarters are roomy and
handsome, and are ventilated and lighted by openings from the
deck. Her machinery consists of two horizontal tubular boilers,
containing 3000 square feet of fire surface, and two horizontal
condensing-engines of 40-inch diameter of cylinder, and 22-inch stroke
of piston. The propeller is 9ft. in diameter, and 16ft. stroke. It has
four blades. The pilot-house is only a few feet above the deck, the
helmsman standing on a platform below it. This, and the turret, are
the only things above the surface of the deck.</p>

<p rend="center"> THE MERRIMAC</p>
<p> was formerly the United States' frigate of that name, which was
scuttled and sunk at the Norfolk Navy-yard, at the commencement of the
rebellion, by the officers of the Union Government, to prevent her
falling into the hands of the Confederates. She was built at
Charleston in 1855, and was pierced for forty guns. Her last service
had been in the Pacific squadron. After the Confederates took
possession of the yard she was raised and converted into a man-of-war
for their own use. Her bull was cut down to within three feet of her
water-mark, and a bombproof house built on her gun deck. She was also
iron-plated, and her bow and stern steel-clad, with a projecting angle
of iron for the purpose of piercing vessels. She has no masts, and
there is nothing to be seen over her gun-deck, with the exception of
her pilot-house and smokestack. Her bombproof is three inches thick,
and is made of wrought Iron. Her armament consists of four 11-inch
navy guns on each side, and two 100-pounder Armstrong guns at the bow
and stern. Last November she made a trial-trip from Norfolk, running
down so close to Fortress Monroe as to be seen by the naked eye, but
ventured no nearer. Although she was looked upon by the Confederates
as a tough customer for a vessel or vessels not protected as she is,
she remained inactive anchored off Norfolk until her present
engagement. The Merrimac was commanded by Franklin Buchanan, formerly
of the Union Navy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">LATEST NEWS FROM ABROAD.</p>
<p>The following telegrams were received through Mr. Reuter's office yesterday (Friday):&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>

<p rend="center">(Per steamer City of New York, vi&#xE2; Queenstown.)</p>

<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>, March 14, Evening.</p>

<p>The<hi rend="italic"> Evening Post</hi> says the balance of
advantage in the late movement of the rival armies on the Potomac is
generally considered to be on the side of the Confederates, even by
the Federal Generals and the warmest friends of the Union. The correspondent of the<hi rend="italic"> New York World</hi> says that the Confederate army made the most successful evacuation and the most secure and perfect retreat of which history furnishes example. It escaped safely with its entire right and left wings from every point threatened by the Federal lines, and securely carried off all its guns and three-fourths of the population, black and white. The next stand will be made on the banks of <sic>Reppahannock</sic> River, from Port Royal to Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>The Confederates have evacuated New Madrid, leaving guns and stores which they could not carry away. The Federal troops have occupied the town.</p>

<p>A rumour is current that island Number Ten has also been evacuated by the Confederates.</p>

<p>Reports have reached this city that General Beauregard has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Confederate army, and that Manassas was evacuated at his suggestion.</p>

<p>The Naval Committee has introduced a bill in Congress providing for
the construction of an iron-clad steamer of 6 000 tons burden, to be
used only as a ram, and appropriating 1,000,000 dols. for this and
also 13,000,000 dols. for iron-clad gun-boats. The bill also
appropriates 700,000 dols. for Stevens Battery, and 500,000 dols. for
the extension of Washington Navy-yard, by erecting machinery to roll
and forge plates for armour-clad ships.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has issued a war bulletin assigning General
Fremont to the command of the military department of the county
west of the Potomac and east of the departments of the Mississippi, to
be called the Mountain Department.</p>

<p>General Fremont's appointment is regarded unfavourably in some quarters, and is looked upon as a conciliatory concession to the Republican party. Mr. Wadsworth, of Kentucky, in a speech in Congress opposing the Tax Bill, said that Fremont's appointment proved that an ultra class were all-powerful with the Administration.</p>

<p>The<hi rend="italic"> Richmond Examiner</hi> says: "We have a positive assurance that the evacuation of Manassas was not caused by pressure of the enemy, but took place purely from strategic reasons." A new line of defence will be organised, which will probably extend from Staunton to Gordonsville."</p>

<p>A portion of General Banks's division has occupied the important town of Winchester, Virginia. Twelve hundred Confederate cavalry, after a slight engagement, fled, and the Federals occupied the town.</p>

<p>Associated-Press despatches state that the Federals were received with loud cheers by the inhabitants of Winchester.</p>

<p>A bill has been brought forward in the House of Representatives

proposing territorial government for the Seceded States. It was ordered to be laid on the table by a majority of 9.</p>

<p>President Davis has suspended Generals Floyd and Pillow for their unsatisfactory report of the evacuation of Fort Donnelson.</p>

<p>The Merrimac is at the Norfolk Navy-yard. A large force of

workmen is engaged in repairing her. Her prongs were seriously damaged, and the forward part of the vessel was stove in. These are being strengthened.</p>  

<p>General Bragg has arrived at Memphis from Pensacola with 20,000 men. Memphis is reported to be in a state of anarchy, and martial law has been proclaimed there.</p>

<p>General Halleck officially reports that the Union forces had driven

the Confederates from Paris, Tennessee. The Federal loss was 100 killed and wounded.</p> 

<p>A desperate fight, lasting one day, occurred on the 21st ultimo
near Fort Craig, New Mexico, but with no decisive result.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MARCH 29</hi>, 1862.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> news from America is of a very
exciting kind. The grand army of the Potomac has at length advanced,
and Washington is free from the presence of an enemy that at one time
menaced the Capitol with destruction. From Manassas, the famous scene
of Federal disaster, the Confederates have retreated, and where or
when they will risk another stand is unknown; but their language
continues to be of the most defiant character, and it is not probable
that they are prepared to give up the game. In the West, fortune has
again been against them; and at a place called Sugar Creek, in
Arkansas, after an engagement of three days, their General (Price) has
been defeated with great slaughter. From Florida to Charleston the
coast is stated to be in Federal hands. Against this catalogue of
defeats is to be set the prestige of a most dashing act of
seamanship. The Merrimac, a "monster" cased in iron, has been brought
into terrible action by the Confederates at Hampton Roads, and her
exploit was to sink the Cumberland Federal vessel with two of those
deadly blows which can only be inflicted by this new and fearful
engine of war. She also compelled the surrender of another Federal
vessel, the Congress; but was in her turn assailed by an enemy of her
own kind, the Monitor. The monsters fought round after round, unable
to injure each other for several hours, but at length the Confederate
vessel received an injury which is variously described, according to
the bias of the narrator. At all events, she retired, and is said to
be shut up in Norfolk by barges sunk by the order of the President
himself. The Confederate victory&#x2014;for we may so call the sending
the Cumberland to the bottom, with a large number of the men on board,
and the capture and burning of the Congress&#x2014;may revive the
spirits of the South, but can have no other effect. The forces of the
North are now pouring in through the breaches, and New York is already
discussing the question, "Whom shall we hang?" The Representatives
have passed the President's bill for offering abolition of slavery to
such Southern States as may desire it. All the interest of New York
concentrates itself on the Potomac army and its advance; but whether
this latter is likely to continue is a question for the
Quartermasters.</p>

<p>...The fame of the Man of Ross is perpetual, but it is likely to be paralleled by the fame of the Man of Danvers. The most magnificent gift which has ever been offered by a single hand has been presented to the poor of London by an American merchant, George Peabody. He hands &#xA3;150,000 to five trustees, of whom Lord Stanley and Sir Emerson Tennent are two, for the purpose of "ameliorating the poor and needy of this great metropolis, and to promote their comfort and happiness." In Danvers and in Baltimore, one his birthplace, the other a city where twenty years of Mr. Peabody's business life was passed, he has planted noble institutions, reserving this third crowning act of generosity for the foreign city where his commercial career has also prospered.</p>

<p rend="center">BREAKING UP OF THE ICE, NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Engraving on page 307, from a drawing
by Harry Fenn, represents a striking scene that takes place annually
about this time of the year in the waters surrounding New York. It is
occasioned principally by the early thaw and separating of the ice in
the upper part of the Hudson River. Being brought down by the receding
tide, it flows round the city, and accumulates in dense masses,
particularly in the narrow channel dividing Long Island from the
mainland, called the East River. Here it becomes at times so choked as
to put a stop to navigation, and makes it impassable to <sic corr="everything">everthing</sic> but the ferry-boats, these cutting
their way by main force though masses of ice that look large enough to
stop the progress of any vessel. A New York ferry-boat presents a
strange appearance to a person new to America, looking far more like a
floating house, or even street, than anything else. These boats
comprise two spacious saloons or cabins&#x2014;one for the smoking and
chewing fraternity, the other dedicated to the ladies, but used by the
public in general. They are well provided with cushioned seats, and
brilliantly lighted with gas, the larger ones carrying vast numbers of
persons, as well as accommodation for forty or fifty
vehicles.</p></div2>

<p rend="cneter">CONFEDERATE PRISONERS AT ROANOKE ISLAND.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Among</hi> the last batch of Sketches received from our Special Artist in

America, illustrative of the Federal victory at Roanoke Island, was one showing the group of the Confederate prisoners at Camp Georgia; and this Illustration, forming a suitable close to the series, we give at page 310.</p>

<p>The following quotation from the <sic>correspondence</sic> of the<hi rend="italic">New York
Evening Post</hi> will serve well as a description to our Engraving of the
prisoners in their camp :&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>"Camp Georgia has been but recently established, and was intended as winter quarters for the rebel forces on the island. The
buildings are extensive board barracks, with well-built log-houses for
officers' quarters and storehouses, and the camp presented the
appearance of a large and well-laid out village. The entire quarters
will comfortably accommodate 4000 men. They had made preparations for
a siege, and had laid in provisions for three months. There was plenty
of good beef and pork, flour, salt, sugar, molasses, and hard bread,
superior to that furnished to the Federal Army. The North Carolina
troops were certainly well cared for; only in the matter of clothing
both officers and men were shabbily provided. The Richmond Blues alone
pretended to be dressed in uniform. The field and staff officers were
habited according to their taste and means, some of them respectably,
but no two of them wearing exactly the same uniform, while some wore
coarse negro cloth of a doubtful grey colour. Instead of
shoulder-straps the Colonels had three stars on either side of the
coat collar, the Lieutenant-Colonels two, and the Major one star. As
for fancy decorations, both officers and men stuck a star or a bit of
lace anywhere in their hats or clothes without reference to
'regulations,' and they looked more like masqueraders than like
military men. The appearance of the prisoners when drawn up in the
camp was unfavourable in comparison with that of the Federal
troops. Their shabby, often fantastical, clothing and attempts at
ornament might have had something to do in prejudicing one's mind
against them, but they seemed generally coarse, vulgar, and uneducated
men and boys, of all ages, from sixteen to sixty, and there was a
large admixture of what the South itself considers 'poor white trash.'
Among the officers there were many
gentlemen, and one or two very fine-looking men. They appeared,
however, crestfallen, and looked as if they had played a desperate
game&#x2014;and lost."</p></q>

<p>Roanoke Island, besides the interest which attaches to it from
recent events, has a special claim on the consideration of Englishmen
as being the spot on which the first settlement in the New World was
made by their forefathers. This event occurred in 1585. It was from
Roanoke, moreover, that the use of tobacco was introduced into
England. Robertson, in his "History of America," gives the following
account of this inauspicious beginning of our settlements in
America:&#x2014;</p>
<q><p>Raleigh fitted out a squadron of seven small ships, under the
command of Sir Richard Greenville, a man of honourable birth, and of
courage so undaunted as to be conspicuous even in that gallant
age. But the spirit of that predatory war which the English carried on
against Spain mingled with this scheme of settlement, and on this
account, as well as from unacquaintance with a more direct and shorter
course to North America, Greenville sailed by the West India
Islands. He spent some time in cruising among these and in taking
prizes, so that it was towards the close of June before he arrived on
the coast of North America. He made some excursions into different
parts of the continent round Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds; but as,
unfortunately, he did not advance far enough towards the north to
discover the noble bay of Chesapeake, he established the colony
(Aug. 25, 1585) on the island of Roanoke, an incommodious station,
without any safe harbour, and almost uninhabited.</p>

<p>This colony consisted of only one hundred and eighty persona, under
the command of Captain Lane, assisted by some men of note, the most
distinguished of whom was Hariot, an eminent mathematician. Their
chief employment, during a residence of nine months, was to obtain a
more extensive knowledge of the country; and their researches were
carried on with greater spirit and reached further than could have
been expected from a colony so feeble and in a station so
disadvantageous. But from the same impatience of indigent adventurers
to acquire sudden wealth which gave a wrong direction to the industry
of the Spaniards in their settlements, the greater part of the English
seem to have considered nothing as worthy of attention but mines of
gold and silver. These they sought for wherever they came; these they
inquired after with unwearied eagerness. The savages soon discovered
the favourite objects which allured them, and artfully amused them
with so many tales concerning pearl fisheries and rich mines of
various metals, that Lane and his companions wasted their time and
activity in the chimerical pursuit of these, instead of labouring to
raise provisions for their own subsistence. On discovering the deceit
of the Indians they were so much exasperated that from expostulations
and reproaches they proceeded to open hostility. The supplies of
provision which they had been accustomed to receive from the natives
were, of course, withdrawn. Through their own negligence no other
precaution had been taken for their support. Raleigh, having engaged
in a scheme too expensive for his narrow funds, had not been able to
send that recruit of stores with which Greenville had promised to
furnish them early in the spring. The colony, reduced to the utmost
distress, and on the point of perishing with famine, was preparing to
disperse into different districts of the country in quest of food,
when Sir Francis Drake appeared with his fleet (June 1, 1856),
returning from a successful expedition against the Spaniards in the
West Indies. A scheme which he formed, of furnishing Lane and his
associates with such supplies as might enable them to remain with
comfort in their station, was disappointed by a sudden storm, in which
a small vessel that he destined for their service was dashed to
pieces; and, as he could not supply them with another, at their joint
request, as they were worn out with fatigue and famine, he carried
them home to England (June 19).</p>

<p>There is one consequence of this abortive colony important enough to entitle
it to a place in history. Lane and his associates, by their constant intercourse with the Indians, had acquired a relish for their favourite enjoyment of smoking tobacco, to the use of which the credulity of that people not only ascribed a thousand imaginary virtues, but their superstition considered the plant itself as a gracious gift of the gods, for the solace of human kind, and the most acceptable offering which men can present to Heaven. They brought with them a specimen of this new commodity to England, and taught their countrymen the method of using it, which Raleigh and some young men of fashion fondly adopted. From imitation of them, from love of novelty, and from the favourable opinion of its salutary qualities entertained by several
physicians, the practice spread among the English. The Spaniards and
Portuguese had, previous to this, introduced it in other parts of
Europe. This habit of taking tobacco gradually extended from the
extremities of the north to those of the south, and, in one form or
other, seems to be equally grateful to the inhabitants of every
climate; and by a singular caprice of the human species, no less
inexplicable than unexampled (so bewitching is the acquired taste for
a weed of no manifest utility, and at first not only unpleasant but
nauseous), that it has become almost as universal as the demands of
those appetites originally implanted in our nature. Smoking was the
first mode of taking tobacco in England; and we learn from the comic
writers towards the close of the sixteenth century and the beginning
of the seventeenth that this was deemed one of the accomplishments of
a man of fashion and spirit.</p>

<p>A few days after Drake departed from Roanoke a small barque, dispatched by
Raleigh with a supply of stores for the colony, landed at the place where the
English had settled; but on finding it deserted by their countrymen they
returned to England. The barque was hardly gone when Sir Richard Greenville
appeared with three ships. After searching in vain for the colony
which he had planted, without being able to learn what had befallen
it, he left fifteen of his crew to keep possession of the island. This
handful of men was soon overpowered and cut in pieces by the
savages.</p></q></div2>

<p rend="center">THE RECENT FLOODS IN SACRAMENTO VALLEY, CALIFORNIA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Accounts</hi> have from time to time appeared in this Journal of the
severe floods with which California was visited at the close of last
year and the beginning of the present one. In the present Number we
are enabled to give three Illustrations from sketches forwarded by
Mr. Edward Vischer, of San Francisco, showing the lamentable condition
of Sacramento City, which, as our readers are aware, suffered terribly
from the floods. The Views were taken by Mr. Vischer whilst on a visit
to Sacramento City immediately after the third flood. Our Artist, like
many residents of San Francisco, went (he says) to witness the
extraordinary sight of an inland lake thirty miles in width, with
steam-boats plying over vast plains but lately furrowed by the plough,
and all the customary means of communication reduced to the frail
tenure of telegraph wires, or supplanted by feats of extraordinary
daring. He went prepared to see misery and dejection, for the doom
apparently sealed, of the commercial emporium of that region, the
capital of the State; he returned convinced that Sacramento will
survive the present calamity, and that Californian energy will recover
from the heavy blow its interests have received. On arriving at the
Levee in Sacramento, on the night of Jan. 23, the chaotic scene,
faintly discernible by the light of the rising moon, with blocks of
buildings emerging out of the engulfing waters, was impressive in the
highest degree; It suggested the gloomiest forebodings; but a few
hours later, with the rising sun, the gloom was dispelled. The
impressiveness of the scene changed into the life and revelry of an
aquatic carnival; and the jostling of hundreds of boats in those
desolate streets, the merry shouts, the passing jest, gave the
impression of a merry crowd indulging in some favourite sport. Even
the Pavilion, the headquarters of the relief committee, which had been
successively the refuge of thousands who had become homeless, and at
the time was the asylum of some six hundred recipients of relief, seemed
empty during the day. The main body was about, fighting the battle of
life; and not until night would the hall be thronged with those who,
having lost their all, had no other refuge.</p>

<p>The Engraving below shows the steam-boat landing-place in
Sacramento City, on the Levee opposite K-street, at three o'clock on
the morning of the 24th of January last, on the arrival of the
Antelope from San Francisco during the third flood. On page 323 is a
view taken at the corner of L and Fourth streets, looking eastwards
towards the pavilion of the Agricultural Society, which was then the head-quarters
of the Howard Benevolent Society, and, as before
mentioned, the refuge of hundreds whose homesteads
were destroyed by the floods. The relief-boat is shown going for
orders from the committee. At the left of the picture are scows from
the country bearing farmers and their stock; whilst in the background
may be seen the Roman Catholic church and schools. Below it is given
another view of the partially submerged city&#x2014;Sixth-street, between M
and N streets, looking south, towards the great break in the
R-street Levee, through which numbers of houses were swept by the violence of the floods.</p>

<p>The condition of things in Sacramento City after the second and
immediately before the third flood is described by a correspondent to a San<sic corr="Francisco"> Fransisco</sic> journal of the 14th of January last:&#x2014;" This unfortunate city presented a sad picture when we arrived on Sunday night. Although they told us the water had lowered considerably still boats were plying from the Levee inwards through all the streets we could see. Yesterday morning the water had settled on Front-street, and some of the principal longitudinal streets&#x2014;taking the line of the river as a diametrical one&#x2014;were passable for short distances on muddy and slippery sidewalks. At the intersection of J and Second streets a piece of dry land was gradually rising from the surrounding waters. The water was falling fast, and it is very probable that before this time some sort of foot navigation is possible through several of the main business streets. The general appearance of the city yesterday was one of gloom and dampness. A dank, fresh-fishy smell pervades
the atmosphere; and such houses as were open to
public view bore evident signs of inundation on the walls and 'slumgullion' on the floors. The latter gave occupation to numberless men with brooms in their hands. Notwithstanding the great and severe

 loss of the people of Sacramento, their faces were not downcast. They
 seemed hopeful and sunshiny. Many were plying their brooms and tuning
 their voices at the same time; and not a few wore that genial
 expression which Lavater might translate to every-day minds by the
 cheerful line, 'We may be happy yet.' "</p>

<p>The effect of the floods on the city is detailed in a
number of the<hi rend="italic"> Sacramento Bee</hi> published after
the third flood. It says:&#x2014;" Many lots and blocks of land in
this city have been much elevated by deposits left by the flood. In
the eastern portion whole blocks have been covered to the depth of
four to eight feet with sandy soil, so that the eaves of one-story
houses and outhouses are on a level with, the new-made soil. The east
Levee in the vicinity of the Fort has secured a backing which no press
of water can break through. In some young orchards the tree-tops just peep above the soil, while elsewhere the vines are all under. The R-street Levee is a total wreck for its entire length, there being in many places no semblance of it left, and the east Levee is not in much better condition. Rabel's tannery property and his dwelling seem to be secured against the current of the American. A great sandbar, very nearly as high as the natural surface of the bank, has been formed in front of his property, which directs the current from him and forces it to strike the bank lower down, where the break is through which the steamer Gem was carried by the force of the water. He has secured a permanent and most substantial bulkhead at that point."</p>

 <p>Meanwhile&#x2014;extracting from the catastrophe such comfort as we best can&#x2014;it is certain that this dire calamity has called forth some of the best and loftiest feelings of human nature; so that one hardly knows which to admire most&#x2014;the fortitude of those who were the immediate sufferers, the ready, devoted courage of those who rushed to their rescue at the risk of their own lives, or the warm, untiring charity of the community at large spared from the visitation, though not exempt from loss. Sacramento City has often been nearly destroyed by fire, yet has always been quickly restored and improved. So, it is to be hoped&#x2014;as, indeed all accounts unite in averring&#x2014;that the State capital will ere long lift its head above the floods and be re-established in more than it former greatness.</p>

<p>The United States' revenue steamer Schubric anchored in the stream
near Rio Vista (of which we give an Engraving), was the rendezvous for
the volunteer relief fleet of whale-boats and scows searching for
sufferers from the flood over the plains on each side of the
Sacramento. A passenger on board the Nevada, which started from San
Francisco on Jan. 12 with a large supply of baked meats, bread, and
other provisions hastily collected for the immediate relief of the
destitute sufferers of Sacramento, thus describes the scene at Rio
Vista:&#x2014;"For some time before we reached this little town, numerous
floating indications of the destruction above were visible on the
water. Portions of houses, tables, chairs, fencing, and other d&#xE9;bris
were hurrying along on the current; but until we reached Rio Vista the
stern reality of human misery was not presented to our view.
Here was a whole town with the water reaching to the roofs of the
one-story buildings. Many of them were careened over, and all, with
the exception of the second story of the principal building,
deserted. A few hundred yards from the town, on a neck of land, were
huddled together the major part of its water-bound inhabitants,
together with as much live stock as could be hastily gathered
together. Here, without shelter, cold, wet, and hungry, were they
destined to await the falling of the waters." By subsequent accounts
we learn that the few buildings at first spared by the floods have
since been washed away, so that not a vestige of this late pleasant
and prosperous village remains.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NAVAL REVOLUTION.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Is</hi> it indeed true that the naval supremacy of England has passed away like a mere unsubstantial exhalation under. the light of that memorable Saturday, March 8, 1862? An American journalist tells us this; but we may pardon the exulting boast when we remember the provocation. It was but a few weeks ago that English journalists of the highest character and position were complacently announcing that we should, in the event of war, at once sweep the seas of all American shipping. That prediction was a very wild and foolish one; let us inquire whether this new prediction is not equally groundless. And, first, suppose we review briefly the incidents of the late combat,
which is perhaps unexampled in history for the exciting interest of its details and for the inherent value of its lessons.</p>

<p>It was, then, on Saturday, the 8th of March last, that the persons who were on the outlook from the Federal fortress Monroe towards the Confederate Navy-yard and Arsenal of Norfolk saw coming towards an intermediate point of land called <sic>Norfolk News</sic> the long-expected Confederate fleet. It consisted of two small iron-clad steamers, some gun-boats, and a strange-looking monster, with something like a sloping house-roof on its top, which the observers knew at once must be the famous Merrimac. This had been a magnificent first-class frigate of between 3000 and 4000 tons, armed
with forty pieces of the most powerful artillery, and forming one of those new and most formidable ships which
the Americans were so justly proud of. At the breaking out of
the war the Merrimac was partly burnt and then sunk by the
Federals, when they were obliged to leave Norfolk to the Confederates; who soon raised the coveted prize, and found her in
all essential respects uninjured. Remembering, then, the many
experiments that had been made in Europe to show the value of iron
armour for ships, and painfully conscious of their weakness at sea,
they appear to have thought there was one grand opportunity open to
them, and to have made use of it with characteristic vigour and
skill. They built up over her deck, and down upon

      Engagement in Hampton Roads: The Confederate Iron-Plated Steamer

her sides, to below the water-line, a complete bomb and ball proof covering, formed of sloping plates of railroad iron, three inches thick, and meeting at the top like the roof of a house, where was the only opening for ventilation. But on
testing this structure with columbiads they found the iron armour was
only too easily penetrable. Again they docked the Merrimac, and again
they heaped on more of the iron clothing, until, it was said (probably
by the Confederates themselves, and for obvious reasons), that she
was so heavy that they could not launch her, and that she was in
danger of breaking her back. These and many similar rumours died away
at last, when the Merrimac was seen on the eventful Saturday coming
forth to do the work she had been so long preparing for, armed with
two 100-pounder Armstrong guns (surely some member will ask in the
House of Commons how these were obtained?) and eight 11-inch guns. But
she had still more terrible weapons in the shape of two great
sharp-pointed beaks at her bow, seven feet apart and level with the
water-line, the uses of which were only too soon to become apparent to
the doomed vessels of the watching Federal fleet. This consisted of
two old sailing-frigates, the Cumberland, twenty guns, and the
Congress, forty guns, at Newport News; and of three other frigates,
the Roanoke, the Minnesota, and the St. Lawrence, at some little
distance in the Hampton Roads. With quiet determination the Congress
and Cumberland prepared for the fight; but they had scarcely begun to
let loose their heavy broadsides against the Merrimac before they had
one awful fact made clear to them&#x2014;that their shot produced no effect
whatever on the enemy, but glanced off from him, to use the expression
of an actor in the scene, like hail from a tin roof. On the other
hand, the shells from the Merrimac began to pour on both vessels with
murderous effect. There was little time allowed to consider what it
were best to do under such circumstances. The iron monster&#x2014;wishing,
perhaps, to test her bodily strength on the smaller of the two vessels
first, and serenely regardless of the broadsides of the heavier&#x2014;passed
the Congress as if forgetting her very existence, and ran, under a
full head of steam, at the Cumberland. Awful indeed was the shock. The
double beak went ploughing into the very entrails of the wooden ship,
then withdrawing and going to the other side she again ran at her, and
left her in a few minutes sinking&#x2014;she and her crew of five hundred men, who fought their guns to the last possible minute, and left the beloved flag flying aloft even after the hull had disappeared below the waves. Such heroism needs no comment but that silent one which it will receive from all true English hearts. Presently the Congress, whose guns were already disabled, and whose decks were covered with the dead and the dying, saw the terrible phenomenon advancing to strike her in the same way; and of course the captain did what it was his bounden duty to do&#x2014;surrender. The officers were taken out as prisoners by a Confederate gun-boat, but the latter was eventually driven off by a fire from the Federal land forts, and at night the vessel was blown up by some of her own people.</p>

 <p>All this while the Roanoke, the St. Lawrence, and the Minnesota
 had been trying to advance to help their fellows. But the first,
 having a broken shaft, could only move by the aid of a tug, and so
 got aground. The second seems also to have grounded immediately. The
 Minnesota drew nearer, but only to experience the same check. And
 thus immovable, deprived of all power to use her special advantages
 of speed and fitness for man&#x153;uvres, the Minnesota was now
 exposed to the fire not only of the monstrous Merrimac but of several
 small gun-boats. But still she kept them off; and still the Merrimac
 seemed willing to be kept off; we now know why, she was afraid of
 grounding. And so night approached. Then the Confederate fleet
 withdrew, flushed with a conquest that must ring through the world,
 and assured that they would make an easy prey of the Minnesota on the
 morrow. And then? Why, then its Captain may have dreamed that he
 alone would be able to accomplish that which England and France, in
 American belief, wished but had not ventured to attempt&#x2014;the raising
 of the whole blockade, by the successive destruction of the Federal
 ships wherever he could find them. That the dream might have proved
 only too true a foreshadowing of reality, all New York, and Boston,
 and Washington testified, as the first news reached those cities of
 the calamity and impending danger. But there was to be a visitor to
 these blood-stained waters the same evening that would altogether
 change the fortunes of that to-morrow, and send yet a new, and to
 Confederate Vision unlooked-for, experience among the later news to
 the Northern cities and to Europe. Some months previously a Swedish
 engineer, already highly esteemed for his various inventions, had,
 though with some difficulty, persuaded the Federal Government to
 allow him to build a small floating and seagoing battery, and had
 made himself, or his friends, pecuniarily responsible for its
 success. It was begun in October, launched by New Year's-Day, and
 completely finished in ten days after. And we beg our readers to note
 the time as well as the cost involved&#x2014;sixty thousand pounds. That
 was all, and that sum was not secured till success was certain. Thus
 do they do some things in America. The inventor called it the
 Monitor, in order, as he says, to admonish the South of the fate of
 their rebellion, England of its fading naval supremacy, and the
 English Government of the folly of spending millions in fixed
 fortifications for defence. Probably the very attention we shall pay
 to the last of Captain Ericsson's lessons will enable us to take care
 that his second lesson shall fall pointlessly.</p>

<p> It was this vessel which, by one of those wonderful coincidences
which the American nation may well believe Providential, came
unexpectedly to Fort Monroe on the evening of the day that had
witnessed the Federal defeat. We know, indeed, from the diary of one
who was on board, that the crew of the Monitor heard the cannonading
as they approached. We may imagine what must have been the emotions of
hope and fear experienced by General Wool at Monroe, and by the crew
of the apparently doomed Minnesota, who waited the whole night in
hourly expectation of the return of the iron-clad monster, as
they gazed upon this new David that proposed to do battle with their
dreadful Goliath. She had but two guns to cope with the Merrimac's
twelve, and was scarcely a third of her size. Nevertheless, she
immediately took up a position in front of the towering Minnesota, and
there waited in grim silence. Early on Sunday morning (and we are told
the day opened in extreme beauty) the Merrimac appeared, and began to
fire as she approached on the Minnesota. But what is this
queer-looking little craft that she sees coming out before her right
in her path, not unlike a gigantic round black hat, with a very
elongated brim, tapering almost to a point before and behind, floating
on the water? The Merrimac is not left long in doubt. There is a
double flash, a terrible boom, and she feels herself struck with solid
double shot that make the whole frame of the monster quiver: no
wonder, when we know that each shot sent by that small stranger
weighed one hundred and seventy pounds, or, together, three hundred
and forty! The Merrimac knows well enough now that she has her
work to do, and she tries to do it. But the lesson she has taught to
others is now commended to her own lips. The little Monitor laughs at
her Armstrongs and her 11-in. guns, and begins coolly to pace round
her, studying as she goes how to plant her every blow in the most
promisingly-vulnerable place. All the other vessels suspend operations
to gaze on this novel and ever-to-be remembered conflict. Now and then one of those on the Federal side receives a damaging shot from the Merrimac, as though the Goliath, in her rage that she cannot hurt the agile enemy before her, finds solace in an occasional blow at something that may be harmed. But, if the Merrimac cannot hurt the Monitor by her shot, she may board and possibly take her. The boarders get on to those flat, wave-washed decks, and find nothing to attack, nowhere to go. The floor of apparently continuous iron is impenetrable. If they could get onto the top of that cupola, nine feet high, of smooth iron, they might find an entrance perhaps, but the prospect is not inviting.  While they hesitate they see the cupola revolve: another moment a gun will open on them with grape. They decline further parley, and disappear. But cannot the Merrimac run the vixen down? She tries; but her prow glides over, and is cut by the sharp edge of the unmanageable little craft; and the guns of the latter take advantage of that very moment, and the close proximity, to pour in their staggering shots. What then can the Merrimac do? A man looks forth, perhaps to obtain some information for the captain, and is instantly cut in two by the Monitor's guns, which are as accurately pointed as they are awful in their strength. At last the Merrimac receives a hint as to what she must do&#x2014;retreat; for those tremendous shots are penetrating at last; she is, in fact, so much hurt that she limps at the stern, and has to call her consorts to her aid to take her out of the way&#x2014;back under the protection of her own forts. And so ended the first fight between iron ships of war, of which history will have to take note.</p>

 <p>And how is this wonderful little vessel framed which has thus
 proved herself so perfect in all points&#x2014;cheapness of cost, rapidity
 of construction, impregnability for defence, and unrivalled power for
 attack? And on this last matter we must note that Captain Ericsson
 says she could have certainly destroyed the Merrimac if she had kept
 her guns quite level, and if she had been permitted to fire
 wrought-iron shot which were on board, but had been forbidden by
 Captain Dahlgren, who was afraid to put his truly magnificent
 ordinance to too great a trial. The Monitor, then, is simply a
 flat-bottomed wooden vessel, wide in the middle and narrowing towards
 the ends, forming a kind of elongated oval, over which has been laid
 a thick flat iron cover, with sides dipping into the water. In battle
 these sides show only a surface of 12in. to 20in. high. On the centre
 of the vessel rises a vast circular pillar or cupola, measuring
 64ft. round, and built of eight several thicknesses of inch-iron,
 fastened by screws inside, so that the plates, if loosened, are
 readily tightened again; and the joinings so arranged that no two can
 anywhere be struck at once by the same shot. This cupola contains the
 two Dahlgren guns, and moves round with them, at the pleasure of the
 director, by steam power. The only other things visible on deck
 during engagement are the covered top of the chimney, which has
 been previously sent down below, telescope fashion, and the
 small pilot-box at the stern, which, though of enormous strength was
 injured by the Merrimac, and was the only part of the monitor she did
 injure. Between the pilot-box and the cupola the communications are
 so admirably arranged that the exact effects of every shot are
 reported instantly to the head men at the guns. All the crew, with
 the exception of these men, sixteen in number, are kept below during
 battle. We need only add that the Monitor's speed is not great; it is
 said only about six knots an hour; that her extreme draught of water
 is only 10ft.; and that she promises to be a good seagoing boat when
 certain defects, merely of minor details, are remedied.</p>

<p>And now what is the first effect of this news upon English

interests? Why, just this, as the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> admirably puts it:&#x2014;Whereas we had available for immediate purposes 149 first-class war
ships, we have now two, these two being the Warrior and her sister
Ironside. There is not now a ship in the English Navy apart from these
two, that it would not be madness to trust to an engagement with that
little Monitor. We are not sure, indeed, that the case is not worse
than the<hi rend="italic"> Times</hi> believes. Is the Warrior itself
a match for the Monitor? It is useless now to talk of speed or
magnificence. We don't want our war ships to run away successfully, or
to be looked at admiringly, but to fight. How would the Monitor deal
with the Warrior? The guns of the first send shot of 170lb.; the guns
of the second, shots of 100lb.; <hi rend="italic">the very shot that the Merrimac fired so uselessly.</hi> Again, the Monitor is practically invulnerable to existing artillery: is the Warrior the same? Why, both her extremities are of wood, and would be blazing in ten minutes, and every man in those parts be destroyed.</p>
<p>But the question&#x2014;and it is one of such solemn import as even
England, through all her momentous history, has rarely had to decide
upon&#x2014;now is, what shall we do? We must act, and act instantly. There
is no time now for any more scientific "experiments," or for red tape
to be indulged with its usual hesitations and mental difficulties. We
are actually without a war fleet. We shall be outstripped to a
certainty by America, and possibly by France, if we do not move at
once. Already America is preparing to finish her Stevens battery,
which promises to be to the Monitor what that was to the Merrimac,
only with all the material proportions reversed, so that it will be probably equivalent to many Monitors, with a speed of twenty miles an hour instead of seven. A gigantic ram is also to be constructed; and, lastly above two millions and a half of money are to be expended on a fleet of ordinary iron ships.</p>

<p>What, then, ought we to do? If while endeavouring to
answer that question we could hope to obtain the ear of any man in authority we would say to him with deep earnestness this:&#x2014;Cease the erection of all seaboard fortifications for the present, at least, and spend the money allotted for them in cutting down our most powerful battle-ships, covering their lowered hulls with iron, building cupolas upon them, and arming these cupolas with guns that, however few in number, will carry shot at least as heavy as the Dahlgren of 170lb. Treat Captain Coles as our cousins are treating Captain Ericsson&#x2014;that is, put the right man into the right place, and give him hearty support when there. Then, for the future, offer attention and a reward to other men of inventive genius, who can improve upon the best existing models; for we may depend upon it that we are now entering upon a race in which success will no longer be achieved by wealth or material
resources, under merely ordinary conditions of skilful development,
but that skill, science, and individual energy will need only moderate
means to obtain the greatest triumphs. But what Englishman can doubt
that in such a struggle we shall at least hold our own? What
Englishman will doubt but that if wisely and promptly used, our
existing naval wealth may in a very short time be again fully realised under altered conditions, and so that
whatever there may have been of soundness and justice in the idea of
English supremacy on the seas shall be again ours? But let it not be
said by history, as it has already been suggested in Parliament&#x2014;it is
harder to work a conversion in our Government than among our
ships.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the City of Washington we are in receipt of telegrams from New York to the 22nd ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The Merrimac has not made her reappearance in Hampton Roads, where the Monitor (whose late commander, Lieut. Worden, is now totally blind with small hopes of recovering his sight) patiently awaits her advent.</p>

<p>General Burnside has captured Newbern, on the coast of North
Carolina. He reports as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>By this victory we have captured eight batteries, containing
forty-six heavy guns; three batteries of light artillery, making in
all sixty-four guns; two steam-boats, a large quantity of ammunition,
rosin, turpentine, and cotton, and over 200 prisoners. The Federal
loss will amount to ninety-one killed and 466 wounded, many of them
mortally. The rebel loss was severe, but not so great as the Federal
loss, they being effectually covered by their works.</p></q>

<p>The report that Mr. Yancey had been captured in a vessel trying to
run the blockade lacks confirmation.</p>

<p>On land the Confederates have taken up a line of defence south of the Rappahannock, with their centre resting on Gordonsville, the junction of the Virginia Central and Virginia and Tennessee Railroads. Although little or no news concerning pending operations transpires, it is certain that a large portion of the Federal army is embarking at Alexandria for the probable purpose of advancing on Richmond by way of Fortress Monroe and James River. General M'Clellan has issued a florid address to his soldiers, promising to take them to a field of action where a decisive battle can be fought.</p>

<p> General Banks's corps-d'arm&#xE9;e has occupied Strasburg without
opposition.</p>

<p>From General Buell's army in Tennessee there is no news of
importance. A correspondent of a New York journal writes thus of the
attitude of the citizens of Nashville:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>The appearance of Nashville reminds one vividly of the towns and cities in Northern Italy after the triumph of the Austrians over the revolution
of 1848. Most of the stores continue closed. But few male and fewer
female inhabitants are visible upon the streets; victorious soldiery
alone enliven them. Half the private residences are deserted and add
further gloom to the aspect by their closed doors and window-shutters and gravelike stillness. Altogether, Nashville looks much more like a conquered than a liberated city.</p></q>

<p>The Governors of Mississippi and Louisiana have issued calls for 15,000 more troops, whom General Beauregard will accept at Jackson in the former State.</p>

<p>Island No.10 in the channel of the Mississippi has been the scene
of a hot engagement between the defending Confederates and the
besieging Federals. Commencing the bombardment on the 17th, after five
days' bombardment by the Federals under Commodore Foote, the
assailants report that no decisive result has been obtained, although
all the guns on the upper battery on the Kentucky side of the river have been silenced, and one gun on the island dismounted.</p>

<p>According to the official report of General Pope the success of the
Federal arms at New Madrid is greater than was at first reported. All the artillery, several thousands of smallarms, ammunition, cartridge-boxes, three hundred mules, several thousand tents, and 1,000,000 dollars' worth of other property fell into his hands. The men escaped during a heavy thunderstorm. They left behind them even their knapsacks and the baggage of their officers. The Federal loss was about fifty wounded. New Madrid was the last place held in Missouri by the Confederates.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The proceedings of Congress have not been important. The Judiciary Committee of the Senate report favourably on the resolution offering the Senate's co-operation with President Lincoln's offer of emancipation by purchase to the slaveowners of the Border States.</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Abolitionist leader, has delivered a lecture on slavery and the war in the hall of the Smithsonian Institute, Washington. The President was not present; but many members of Congress were. He was received on the floor of the Senate, being introduced there by Senator Sumner; and he afterwards addressed a

Massachusetts regiment stationed at Alexandria.</p>
<p> The New York merchants are getting up a subscription for a
testimonial to Captain Ericsson, the architect of the steam-battery Monitor. A letter he has written to Mr. Epes Sargent, of Boston, illustrates the moral which the Federals are drawing from the achievements of the Monitor:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>My dear Sargent,&#x2014;I accept with great pleasure your congratulations, and
assure you that every exertion will be made on my part to furnish the
nation with war vessels that will enable us to defy Europe. Give me
only the requisite means, and in a very short time we can say to those
Powers now bent on destroying Republican freedom, leave the Gulf of
Mexico with your frail craft or perish! I have all my life
asserted that mechanical science will put an end to the power of
England over the seas. The ocean is nature's highway between the
nations. It should be free; and surely nature's laws, when properly
applied, will make it so. Yours very truly, J. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ericsson.</hi></p></q></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> news from America is of a strange and
perplexing kind. The sudden and grand movement of the army of the
Potomac was an event in the war, and it excited the utmost interest
all over the North. The details of the breaking up and onward march
were truly spirit-stirring. It is true that the enemy did not wait to
receive General M'Clellan, but completed a masterly retreat which left
nothing but the soil and some abandoned fortifications to the
Federals. On this account the young General has been severely attacked
by a party in the North, though how he could prevent his enemy running
away it is difficult to understand. We are sorry, too, to observe
that such attacks proceeded from the Abolitionists, who have chosen to
regard the General as a friend to the domestic institution, though, so
far as we can learn, he seems to have adhered to the duty of a
soldier, and to have known nothing except that there were enemies to
be crushed. But the army moved, and a somewhat grandiose proclamation
was put forth by General M'Clellan, inviting his men to follow him to
their graves, if necessary, but not to wonder at any strange action of
his, warning them that they had no light task before them, for that
their enemies were brave men, and adding, "God smiles on us." The next
news is that the hideous mud of the invaded country has made it
impossible for the Federals to march; that their ranks are thinned, to
a remarkable extent, by desertion, drunkenness, and death; and that
their Commander is compelled to devise another route for them, by
water, which seems to promise better, but which was by no means in the
original programme. Beyond this very
unsatisfactory report, and the statement that one of the Mississippi
islands is being stoutly held by the South, while another victory of
some magnitude has been gained by the Burnside expedition, there is
little definite news; and it is not worth while subjecting to the
crucible the heap of rumours which we receive touching the want of
confidence in M'Cllellan, the reasons for the again confiding the
command to the "tainted" Fremont, and the rest of the points which the
American press&#x2014;now far more sternly bound down by authority than the
press in France&#x2014;raises for the amusement of those for whom war news
must not be provided.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">MR. GEORGE PEABODY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> gentleman, whose munificent act is
now the theme of common discourse throughout the land, and whose
Portrait is given on page 335, is a native of Danvers, Massachusetts,
where he was born Feb. 18, 1795. He is the sixth in descent from
Francis Peabody, who, at the age of twenty-one, and in the year 1635,
went to New England from St. Albans, Herts. He died, in 1698, the
father of fourteen children, of whom six were sons. His name is now a
common one in Massachusetts. The parents of the subject of this brief
memoir were not blessed with any superfluity of means, and the future
merchant prince of both worlds gained all the scholastic education he
ever acquired at the district common school of his native town. At the
early age of eleven he was placed in a grocer's store in Danvers,
where he remained four years. At the age of sixteen the youth was
invited to help an elder brother in a dry-goods business in
Newburyport, then, as now, one of the principal seaport towns of
Massachusetts. His brother was soon "burnt out" in the conflagration
still known to local fame as the great fire of Newburyport. In May,
1812, his uncle started a dry-goods business in Georgetown, in the
district of Columbia, and called upon his nephew to join him. The
management of the business devolved upon the younger relative. But for
a time the pressing demands of patriotism made themselves heard above
those of business. The war of 1812 had broken out, and George Peabody
joined a volunteer company of artillery formed at Georgetown, and
found himself on active duty at Fort Warburton. Happily, no engagement
took place, and the volunteer soon returned to the more congenial and more profitable pursuits of peace. He remained with his uncle two years. The business was not promising, and he reluctantly withdrew from it.</p>

 <p>There was one man, however, who had noticed the remarkable ability and activity of young George Peabody, and who judged that in him the capitalist would gain a desirable coadjutor. This man was Mr. Elisha Riggs. Mr. Riggs proposed to find the capital to establish a dry-goods business which young Peabody was to manage. The discovery that the latter was only nineteen years of age did not make Mr. Riggs waver. And now Mr. Peabody may be said to have entered that channel which led directly to his great success in life. In 1815 the house was removed to Baltimore; and in 1822 the extension of its operations justified the establishment of branches in Philadelphia and New York. In 1829 Mr. Elisha Riggs retired, and Mr. Peabody became senior partner.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Peabody began to visit Europe. On more than one
occasion he was charged with important financial negotiations for the
State of Maryland. For his gratuitous services to the State the
General Assembly passed a vote of thanks to their generous agent and
representative. Early in 1837 he took up his abode in London. He had
not been in London long when the financial crash of 1837 occurred,
which prostrated American credit in England. Mr. Peabody's optimist
views of the elastic resources of his native country, sound though
they were were, received with skepticism in the City, but established
for him a solid title to the gratitude of the American world of
commerce. In 1843 Mr. Peabody retired from the firm of Peabody, Riggs,
and Co., and established the money-dealing house of George Peabody and
Co., of which he is still the efficient and active head. In this
business he became a millionaire. His biographer, in<hi rend="italic"> Hunt's Merchants' Magazine</hi>, to whom we owe the principal facts in the above sketch, thus enumerates the qualities which have contributed to this result:&#x2014;"A judgment quick and cautious, and clear and sound; a decided purpose, a firm will, energetic and persevering industry; punctuality and fidelity in every engagement; justice and honour controlling every transaction; and courtesy&#x2014;that true courtesy which springs from genuine kindness&#x2014;presiding over all the intercourse of life."</p>

 <p>Mr. Peabody's career has another aspect beside the financial. His
 position as a merchant has served only as a foil to display him in
 the character of a humanitarian. The Anglo-American merchant, though
 no professional politician, early perceived that his position would
 enable him to act as a link between the English and American
 People. His Fourth of July dinners, where philo-American English and
 philo-English American gentlemen sat round the same table and made an annual demonstration of international fraternity in the eyes of the two worlds, constitute an event in the history of the relations of the two kindred, but alas! too often alienated, nations. These dinners were discontinued only when there was a body of American residents who were ready to take the good work out of Mr. Peabody's hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Peabody is not encumbered with family ties; he is a bachelor;
his collateral relations, some of whom he supported when he was a very
young man, have long since ceased to need help from him. Of the
copious stream of private benefactions which he dispensed to needy
Americans in England we can speak only from general repute, but the
monuments of his public beneficence are, or soon will be (we may
almost say), scattered over the world. To his native town he has given
about l00,000 dols. to found a library and lecture fund. The Peabody
Institute of Danvers is now in active operation. To the citizens of
Baltimore&#x2014;the city where he spent more than twenty years of his
business life, and where he gained that standing which was the source
of his success in London&#x2014;he gave, in 1857, the sum of 500,000 dollars
to found an institute in that wealthy but heretofore unlettered city,
which should embrace a free library, a fund to pay for lectures to
which certain classes were to have free admission, an academy of
music, a gallery of art, and premises for the accommodation of the
Maryland Historical Society. The opening of this institution has been
retarded by the war in America, which has brought upon Baltimore the
inconveniences of a military occupation. His last public benefaction,
that of &#xA3;150,000 for the benefit of the poor of London,
differing in kind as it does from those which he has bestowed upon his
native country, surpasses them all in magnitude. It has long been the
praiseworthy fashion of American millionaires, after providing amply
for their families, if they have any, to found with the bulk of their
wealth some public institution, promotive of the intellectual or
physical welfare of their fellow-citizens. Thus, New Orleans has had
her M'Donogh, Philadelphia her Stephen Girard, Boston her John Lowell
and Abbott Lawrence, Oswego her Gerritt Smith, New York her John Jacob
and William B. Astor and her Peter Cooper, and Baltimore her George
Peabody. The last has excelled all other American public benefactors,
not alone in the extent and variety of his munificence, but especially
in this respect-that while <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will be
remembered by a grateful posterity in one branch only of the
English-speaking race, the memory of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> Anglo-American Mec&#xE6;nas
will be an inheritance shared equally between Britain and the United
States, and will add one to that long list of names in politics and
literature which both nations delight to honour, and which serve to
nourish a sentiment which moderates the violence and survives the
effects of temporary causes of estrangement.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> columns last week contained the announcement of an extraordinary gift made to the poor of the metropolis by Mr. George Peabody, the well-known American banker in London, whose Portrait we have
great pleasure in giving. Mr. Adams, the American Minister, Lord Stanley, Sir J. Emerson Tennent, Mr. C. Lampson, and the donor's partner, Mr. Morgan, are requested by Mr. Peabody to act in the capacity of trustees for the application of the fund (&#xA3;150,000) which he proposes to devote to the amelioration of the condition of the London poor. Mr. Peabody's letter to these gentlemen, announcing and slightly developing his plan, is as follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">London, March 12, 1862.</p>

<q><p>Gentlemen,&#x2014;In reference to the intention which it is the object of this letter to communicate, I am desirous to explain that from a comparatively early period of my commercial life I had resolved in my own mind that, should my labours be blessed with success, I would devote a portion of the property thus acquired to promote the intellectual, moral, and physical welfare and comfort of my fellow-men, wherever, from circumstances or location, their claims upon me would be the strongest.</p>

<p>A kind Providence has continued me in prosperity,
and, consequently, in furtherance of my resolution, I, in the year 1852, founded an institute and library for the benefit of the people of the place of my birth, in the town of Danvers, in the State of Massachusetts, the result of which has proved in every respect most beneficial to the locality and gratifying to myself.</p>

<p>After an absence of twenty years I visited my
 native land in 1857, and founded in the city of Baltimore, in the State of Maryland (where more than twenty years of my business life had been passed), an institute upon a much more extended scale, devoted to science and the arts, with a free library, coinciding with the character of the institution. The cornerstone was laid in 1858, and the building is now completed, but its dedication has been postponed in consequence of the unhappy sectional differences at present prevailing in the United States.</p>

<p>It is now twenty-five years since I commenced my residence and
business in London as a stranger; but I did not long feel myself " a
stranger " or in a "strange land," for in all my commercial and social
intercourse with my British friends during that long period I have
constantly received courtesy, kindness, and confidence. Under a sense
of gratitude for these blessings of a kind Providence, encouraged by
early associations, and stimulated by my views as well of duty as of
inclination, to follow the path which I had heretofore marked out for
my guidance, I have been prompted for several years past repeatedly to
state to some of my confidential friends my intention at no distant
period, if my life was spared, to make a donation for the benefit of
the poor of London. Among those friends are three of the number to
whom I have now the honour to address this letter. To my particular
friend, C.M. Lampson, Esq., I first mentioned the subject five years
ago. My next conversations in relation to it were held about three
years since with my esteemed friend Sir James Emerson Tennent, and
with my partner, J. S. Morgan, Esq. I also availed myself of
opportunities to consult the Right Rev. Bishop M'Ilvaine, of Ohio, and
with all these gentlemen I have since freely conversed upon the
subject in a way to confirm that original intention.</p>

<p>My object being to ameliorate the condition of the poor and needy
of this great metropolis, and to promote their comfort and happiness,
I take pleasure in apprising you that I have determined to transfer to
you the sum of &#xA3;150,000, which now stands available for this
purpose on the books of Messrs. George Peabody and Co., as you will
see by the accompanying correspondence.</p>

<p>In committing to you, in full confidence in your judgment, the administration of this fund, I cannot but feel grateful to you for the onerous duties you have so cheerfully undertaken to perform, and I sincerely hope and trust that the benevolent feelings that have prompted a devotion of so much of your valuable time will be appreciated not only by the present but future generations of the people of London.</p>

<p>I have few instructions to give, or conditions to impose, but there are
some fundamental principles from which it is my solemn injunction
that those intrusted with its application shall never, under any circumstances, depart.</p>

<p>First and foremost among them is the limitation of
its uses absolutely and exclusively to such purposes as may be
calculated directly to ameliorate the condition and augment the
comforts of the poor, who, either by birth or established residence,
form a recognised portion of the population of London.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is my intention that now and for all time there
shall be a rigid exclusion from the management of this fund of any
influences calculated to impart to it a character either <sic corr="sectarian">sactarian</sic> as regards religion, or exclusive in relation to local or party politics.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in conformity with the foregoing conditions, it is my wish and intention that the sole qualifications for a participation in the benefits of this fund shall be an ascertained and continued condition of life such as brings the individual within the description (in the ordinary sense of the word) of "the poor" of London, combined with moral character and good conduct as a member of society. It must therefore be held to be a violation of my intentions if any duly qualified and deserving claimant were to be excluded either on the grounds of religious belief or of political bias.</p>

<p> Without in the remotest degree desiring to limit your discretion in the selection of the most suitable means of giving effect to these objects, I may be permitted to throw out for your consideration, among the other projects which will necessarily occupy your attention, whether it may not be found conducive to the conditions specified above for their ultimate realisation, and least likely to present difficulties on the grounds I have pointed out for avoidance, to apply the fund, or a portion of it, in the construction of such improved dwellings for the poor as may combine in the utmost possible degree the essentials of healthfulness, comfort, social enjoyment, and economy.</p> 

<p>Preparatory to due provision being made for the
formal declaration of the trust, and for its future
management and appropriation, the sum of &#xA3;150,000
will be at once transferred into your names and placed
at your disposal, for which purpose I reserve to myself full power and authority; but, as a portion of the money may probably not be required for some time to come to meet the legitimate purposes contemplated, I would suggest that, as early as possible after the organisation of the trust, &#xA3;100,000 should be invested for the time being in your names, in Consols or East India Stock; thus adding to the capital by means of the accruing interest; and the stock so purchased can be gradually sold out as the money is wanted for the objects designated. Meantime, pending the preparation of a formal trust deed, you shall be under no responsibility whatever in respect of the fund, or its investment or disposition.</p>

<p>With these preliminary stipulations I commit the fund to your
management, and to that of such other persons as by a majority of your
voices you may elect, giving you the power either to add to your
number, which I think should not at any time exceed nine, or to supply
casual vacancies occurring in your body. It is my further desire that
the United States' Minister in London for the time being should
always, in virtue of the office, be a member of the trust, unless in
the event of his signifying his inability to act in discharge of the
duties.&#x2014;I have the honour to be, gentlemen, yours very
faithfully,</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">George Peabody.</hi></p></q>

<p>Mr. Adams, Lord Stanley, Sir J.E. Tennent, Messrs. Lampson and
Morgan have accepted the trust, and in their reply to Mr. Peabody
justly remark:&#x2014;"Whether we consider the purity of the motive, the
magnitude of the gift, or the discrimination displayed in selecting
the purposes to which it is to be applied, we cannot but feel that it
is for the nation to appreciate, rather than for a few individuals to
express their gratitude for, an act of beneficence which has few (if
any) parallels in <sic corr="modern">odern</sic> times."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE ACCOUNT OF THE NAVAL FIGHT IN HAMPTON
ROADS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the Confederate Congress, on the 10th ult., the following communication was received from the Executive, in response to the resolution of Mr. Lyons calling for the report of the naval battle in Hampton Roads. The description differs, it will be seen, from the Federal account, especially as regards the result of the contest between the Merrimac and the Monitor. It will be observed that the Merrimac is throughout called the Virginia, hawing been renamed by the Confederates:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">Confederate States' Steam-battery Virginia,<lb/>
off Sewall's Point, March 8.</p>

<q><p>Flag Officer,&#x2014;In consequence of the wound of Flag-officer Buchanan, it
becomes my duty to report that the Virginia left the yard this morning at
eleven o'clock, steamed down the river past our batteries, and over to Newport
News, where we engaged the frigates Cumberland, and Congress and the
batteries ashore, and also two large steam-frigates, supposed to be the Minnesota and Roanoke, and a sailing-frigate and several small steamers armed
with heavy rifled guns. We sank the Cumberland, and drove the Congress
ashore, where she hauled down her colours and hoisted the white flag;
but she fired upon us with the white flag flying, wounding Lieutenant
Minor and some of our men. We again opened fire upon her, and she is
now in flames. The shoal water prevented our reaching the other
frigates. This, with approaching night, we think, saved them from
destruction. Our loss is two killed and eight wounded. Two of our guns
have the muzzles shot off; the prow was twisted, and armour somewhat
damaged; the anchor and all flagstaffs shot away, and the smoke-stack
and steam-pipe were riddled. The bearing of officers and men was all
that could be wished; and, in fact, it could not have been otherwise,
after the noble and daring conduct of the flag officer, whose wound is
deeply regretted by all on board, who would kindly have sacrificed
themselves in order to save him. We were accompanied from the yard by
the Beaufort, Lieutenant Parker, and Raleigh, Lieutenant Alexander;
and as soon as it was discovered up the James River that the action
had commenced we were joined by the Patrick Henry, Commander Tucker;
the Jamestown, Lieutenant Barney; and the Teaser, Lieutenant Webb, all
of which were actively engaged and rendered very efficient
service. Enclosed I send the surgeons' report of the casualties.</p>

Your obedient servant,<lb/>

<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Battle on Saturday</hi></p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th the steam-frigate Virginia, flag-officer
Franklin Buchanan commanding, left her moorings at the dockyard, and,
attended by the steam-tugs Beaufort, Lieutenant-Commanding Parker, and
the Raleigh, Lieutenant-Commanding Alexander, steamed down the
harbour. It was a gallant sight to see the iron-clad leviathan gliding
noiselessly through the water, flying the red pennon of her commander
at the fore flagstaff and the gay Confederate ensign aft. Not the
least impressive thought which she suggested was that her gallant
crew, under a commander and officers worthy to direct their destiny
and defend the flag she bore, went thus boldly with smiles and huzzas
to solve a new problem in maritime warfare&#x2014;to make the
"trial-trip" of the Virginia the trial of battle. Nor could any man
behold the little tugs, with the gay ensigns at peak and masthead,
their battle flags set, steaming in her wake, without an emotion of
admiration for the brave men they thus bore and a prayer for their
deliverance. In the wake of all came the Port Admiral, with a staff of
naval officers. Thus down the harbour, past the wharves, thronged with
eager citizens, past the batteries, whose parapets were dark with
soldiers, steamed the squadron. Through the two barricades, and then
the Virginia put her helm a-starboard and took the south
channel. Meantime, the morning was as still as that of a Sabbath. The
two frigates lay with their boats as the booms and washclothes in the
rigging. Did they see the long dark hull? Had they made her out? Was
it ignorance, apathy, or composure? These were the questions we
discussed as we steamed across the flats to the south of the frigate,
with the two gallant little gun-boats well on our starboard beam,
heading up for the enemy. Our doubts were solved by the heavy boom of
a gun from beyond Sewall's Point. The reverberation rolled across the
sunlit water and died away; but still the clothes hung in the rigging,
still the boats lay at the booms. Another gun (1.20) broke on the air,
and a tug started from Newport News, while at the same time two others
left Old Point, taking the channel inside Hampton bar. Steadily, with
a grim and ominous silence, the Virginia glides through the water;
steadily and with defiant valour the Beaufort and Raleigh follow where
she leads. At 1.50 a rifled gun from one of these little vessels rang
out, then a white puff from her consort. Still the clothes in the
rigging and the boats at the boom. Was this confidence? It could not
be ignorance. Did it mean torpedoes, submarine batteries, infernal
machines? The gun-boats have fired again, and lo! here away to
the eastward were the Roanoke and Minnesota, rising like prodigious
castles above the placid water, the first under steam, the second in
tow. Other puffs of smoke, other sharp reports from the gun-boats, but
the Virginia goes on steadily, silently, to do her work. Now the
in-shore frigate, the Cumberland, fires; now the Virginia close
aboard, now Sewall's Point Battery, now the Minnesota, now the
Roanoke, now the air trembles with the cannonade. Now the Virginia
delivers both broadsides, now she runs full against the Cumberland's
starboard bow, now the smoke clears away, and she appears to be
heading up James River. This at twenty-two minutes to two. The
Congress now lets fall foretopsail and then the main, and so, with a
tug alongside, starts down the north channel, where the Minnesota has
grounded, and presently runs plump ashore. Meanwhile the Virginia
opens upon the Yankee fort; slowly she steams back, and the
Cumberland, sunk now to her white streak, opens upon her again. A
gallant man fought that ship&#x2014;a man worthy to have maintained a
better cause. Gun after gun he fired; lower and lower sank his ship,
his last discharge comes from his pivot-gun, the ship lurches to
starboard, now to port, his flag streams out wildly, and now the
Cumberland goes down on her beamends, at once a monument and an
epitaph of the gallant men who fought her. The Virginia stops. Is she
aground? And the gun-boats Raleigh and Beaufort&#x2014;glorious
Parker, glorious Alexander? There they are on the quarters of the
Congress hammering away, and creeping up closer and closer all the
time. At ten minutes to four the Congress struck. Parker hauled down
the ensign, run up his own battle-flag in its place. There the heroic
Taylor, who fought the Fanny at Roanoke Island and Elizabeth City, got
his wound; there the gallant young Hutter fell&#x2014;all shot by the
dastards who fired from the ship and shore when the white flag was
flying at the main and mizen of the Congress. Here, too, and in the
same way, flag-officer Buchanan and flag Lieutenant R. Minor were
wounded. Now the James River gun-boats, whose dark smoke had been seen
against the blue distance ever since three o'clock, come dashing along
past the shore batteries, Tucker, the courtly and chivalrous, leading
the van, with the Jamestown, Lieutenant-Commanding Barney, close
aboard, and the little Teaser, Lieutenant Webb, in her wake, like a
bow-legged bulldog in chase of the long, lean staghounds. It was a
gallant dash, and, once past the batteries, the two heavy vessels took
position in line of battle, while the Teaser dashed at the Minnesota,
looking no larger then a cockboat. And right well she maintained the
honour of her flag and the appropriateness of her name. Now the
Roanoke puts her helm up and declines the battle. Now the Virginia is
thundering away again, the <sic>Teazer</sic> still closer in. We are
closer in&#x2014;sizz comes a shell ahead; presently another astern;
finally a third, with a clear, sharp whizz, just over head, to the
great delight of the Commodore, who appreciated the compliment of
these good shots, which were the last of six directed shots at the
Harmony. Now the schooner Reindeer comes foaming along, cut out from
under the shore batteries; she reports, and is sent up in charge of
Acting Master Gibbs; and next the gallant Beaufort runs down. Parker
steps and brings on board the great piece of bunting we saw hauled
down just now. He brings also some thirty prisoners and some wounded
men&#x2014;men wounded under that white flag yonder desecrated by the
Yankees. One of these lies stretched out decently covered over,
gasping his life on the dock&#x2014;a Yankee shot through the head, all
bloody and ghastly, killed by the inhuman fire of his own
people. Another pale and stern, the captain of the Beaufort's gun,
lies there too, a noble specimen of a man, who has since gone where
the weary are at rest. A gallant man, a brave seaman ! We shake
hands with Parker; he gets back to his vessel slightly wounded, as is
Alexander also, and steams back gallantly to the fight. The Patrick
Henry, the Jamestown, the Teaser, the Beaufort, the Raleigh, and the
grand old Virginia, are thundering away. We steam down and speak the
first. We hear a report of casualties; we shake hands with friends; we
shove off, cheer, and steam towards the Swash Channel. Presently,
through the thickening gloom, we see a red glare; it grows larger,
 and brighter,
and fuller and redder. It creeps higher and higher, and now gun after gun booming on the still night, as the fire reaches them; the batteries of the Congress are discharged across the water in harmless thunder. It was a grand sight to see, and by the light of the burning ship we made our way back to Norfolk. At half-past eleven the act of retribution was complete, for at that hour, with a great noise, she blew up.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Battle on Sunday.</hi></p>

<p>Some detention occurred on board the Virginia on Sunday morning, we
learn, or she would have commenced the engagement much earlier than half-past eight o'clock, at which time she, together with the Patrick Henry and Jamestown and our other gun-boats, opened fire on the Minnesota, which still lies hard and fast aground. The tide being at the ebb, the Virginia did not take the channel where the Minnesota lay, probably for fear of grounding,
but, getting within a good range of her, she opened fire with
terrific effect, completely riddling her, and rendering constant
exertion at the pump necessary to prevent her from filling. Early in
the morning the Ericsson battery, now called the Monitor, was
discovered off Newport News Point, she having gone up there during the
night. A sharp encounter soon took place between her and the Virginia,
during which time they were frequently not more than thirty or forty
yards apart. Unfortunately the Virginia ran aground, and the Ericsson,
using her advantage, poured shot after shot into her, but without doing any
serious damage. In a short while, however, the Virginia succeeded in
getting off, and, putting on a full head of steam, ran her bow into
the Ericsson, doing her, as it is thought, great damage. We are
rejoiced to say that, notwithstanding the firing was much heavier than
on Saturday, there were no casualties in either of our vessels, not a
man being in the least injured by shots from the enemy or
otherwise. Several of the enemy's gunboats being within range, they
were favoured with a shell or two from the Virginia with telling effort, and in every case disabling or sinking them. One of these lying alongside the Minnesota had a shell thrown aboard of her, which on bursting tore her asunder and sent her to the bottom. Having completely riddled the Minnesota, and disabled the St. Lawrence and Monitor, besides, as stated above, destroying several of the enemy's gun-boats,&#x2014;in a word, having accomplished all that they designed, and having no more material to work upon, our noble vessels left the scene of their triumphs and returned to the yard, where they await another opportunity of displaying their prowess.</p></q>

<p>A book which is entitled "The War in America" of course carries
with it a facile introduction to the reading public at this moment;
and we have to present to general notice a work so designated, which
has been published by Hamilton, Adams, and Co. for the author, Colonel
Tal. P. Shaffner, LL.D., of Kentucky, member of the Bar of the Supreme
Court of the United States, F.R.G.S., F.R.A.S., &amp;c. It consists
of an historical and political account of the Southern and Northern
States, showing the origin and cause of the present Secession
War. Colonel Shaffner is a native of Virginia, and he avows himself an
advocate of the cause of the South. He does not claim for himself any
special Impartiality of opinion, although he pledges himself to his
facts, in the preparation of which he had in view those which bore,
mediately or immediately, on the civil war, and we think that it will
be found that he has brought together many singular and certainly some
most interesting details. As the author states himself that he has not
been very moderate in exposing what he terms the evil theories of
American political abolitionism, and has not failed to denounce the
political integrity of those whom he asserts to have produced
secession, he must expect his work to be examined with caution, and
his opinions to be weighed before they are accepted. It may be, as he
states, that the irrepressible conflict between free and slave labour
has been waged, not for the good of the slave, but for political
power, and to effect a protective tariff; that the white labour of the
North has required a tariff, the slave labour of the South free trade;
but his readers, who will no doubt be many, must be excused if they do
not take this on his <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi>. They will turn to his historical narrative, which, for the sake of the author's own argument, may be assumed to be accurate, and they will draw their own conclusions. One thing they all will be probably ready to admit, and that is, that the author has taken a very comprehensive view of his subject, and has shown no little labour and pains in tracing the history of the United States back to their origin. The sketch of the new States and territories of the Union, and the chapter on the climate of the United States, may be pointed to as amongst the earliest indications of the capabilities of the writer; and amidst a mass of matter, admirably condensed into a moderate space, relating to the political history of the country, we may point to the chapter which treats of political parties in the States from 1789 to 1860. It is probable that we in England profess to understand the case of the Northern States better than we do that of the South, and any information which tends to a large and impartial consideration of the question at issue is to be welcomed; and from this point of view, even if there were not others, we should be inclined to accept Colonel Shaffner's work.</p>

<p> By an obvious sequence we come to the notice of a work just
published by Chapman and Hall, called "Cotton: the Chemical,
Geological, and Meteorological Conditions Involved in its Successful
Cultivation; with an Account of the Actual Condition and Practice of
Culture in the Southern or Cotton States of North America," by Dr. John
William Mallet; who, in addition to several honorary titles to
distinction, is Professor of Chemistry in the University of Alabama,
Analytic Chemist of the Geological Survey of that State, and Chemical
Professor to the State School of Medicine, Mobile. For the publication
of the work in its
present form, however, Mr. Robert Mallet is responsible. When
Dr. John Mallet settled a few years since in Alabama as a chemical
professor, having every facility for observation and experiment, he
submitted to a thorough investigation the chemistry of cotton and all those conditions upon which its successful growth and culture depend. When in England, about four years ago, he formally stated his views to the East India Company, and was provided with specimens of the cotton-plant, root, fibre, seed, &amp;c., and of the various soils and subjacent
rocks from the cotton-growing districts of India. At the same time he
procured from the Government of France a similar though more limited
collection from Algeria and other French possessions, and, through the
Cotton Supply Association of Manchester, others from Central and
Southern Africa, as well as from Egypt. With such materials for
comparison he carried on his investigations in the cotton-growing
States of America, and the volume before us is the first fruit of his
labours. The substance of the book was communicated to the
<lb/>Royal Society, and has been printed in its "Proceedings." As it
seemed probable that the work in its entirety would not be published
in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi>, the present
editor, without consulting the wishes of the author, his son,
communication with whom has been cut off by the war, took on himself
to publish it in its present form. It must be understood that this is
only a portion of the information which Dr. Mallet proposes to give to
the world on this important subject, and that in a future volume the
results of the researches which he is still pursuing will be continued
or completed, and any such volume will contain his experience with
regard to the requirements and effects of various manures, or
dressings of the soil, indicated by the chemistry of the plant, upon
the production and quality of the fibre. The contents of the present
volume will go far to point out how numerous and complex are the
natural conditions which must combine to admit of the cultivation of
cotton of good quality with advantage. The facts here stated must tend
to correct a very prevalent mistake that cotton can be grown anywhere
if there be but a tropical or a semitropical climate, the truth being
that it is a plant as limited and circumscribed by conditions of
growth and seeding as the vine. Indeed, there is much here set down
which goes to show conclusively that the surface of India that is well
adapted, by soil, climate, &amp;c., to the successful culture of
thoroughly good cotton is extremely limited. Much, however, has been
done in these pages to indicate what are the requirements by which
such areas in India must be characterised and chosen, and so failure of attempts at cotton cultivation in unsuitable

regions be avoided, and that which is by nature limited best economised. When it is considered how strong the current of opinion has been towards efforts for creating such a growth of cotton in India as will render this country practically independent of America, it is most desirable that a work like this should be circulated largely amongst those whose interests are concerned or whose adventurous spirit has been aroused by the critical condition of our cotton supply.</p></div2>

<p>At the meeting of the Institution of Naval Architects&#x2014;held
on Thursday week, under the presidency of Sir John Pakington&#x2014;the secretary,
Mr. E. J. Reed, announced that he had received a letter from the
Hon. Captain Cochrane, in command of her Majesty's steamer Warrior,
accompanied by a chart or diagram of a perfectly novel kind, in which
what might be called a complete scientific record of that vessel's
voyage to Lisbon and Gibraltar and home again was set forth. From
Mr. Reed's explanatory statement it appeared that the Warrior rolled
or lurched worst on the 24th of January, when entering the Bay of
Biscay, where she met with exceedingly heavy rollers nearly abeam, and
a head sea. The greatest angle through which she lurched on that day
was 39 deg. measured from the extremes. This was at seven o'clock in
the morning, and she continued to lurch through angles exceeding 50
deg. at intervals until twelve o'clock, the rolls being measured in
all cases by a clinometer placed 20ft. 6in. before the foremost
sternpost, and 3ft. 6in. below the upper deck. It was even stated by
some on board that the ship inclined three several times, on this 24th
of January, through angles exceeding 39 deg.; but the correctness of
the observations in these cases is doubted. On the homeward voyage no
such extreme rolling was experienced, the greatest inclinations then
attained being 17 deg. to port and 6 deg. to starboard on one occasion,
and 10 deg. to port, and 15 deg. to starboard on another. It should be
observed, however, that the time of rolling&#x2014;taking the worst days on
the outward and homeward voyages respectively for comparison&#x2014;did not
vary greatly, the average oscillation being, in the former case,
6&#xB7;5 per minute, and in the latter 6&#xB7;25. The average
number during the whole outward voyage was 6; during the homeward,
4&#xB7;77. Even when unassisted by her sails, the good ship several
times approximated towards the speed produced at the measured mile,
which was 14&#xB7;35 knots. On leaving Lisbon for Gibraltar, for
example, with all sails furled, she ran at more than 13 knots for
nearly a day, and part of the time actually exceeded 14 knots. In his
letter to the secretary Captain Cochrane says:&#x2014;"I cannot refrain from
taking this opportunity of mentioning that the Warrior behaved nobly
in the severe gales and heavy sea she encountered, and that on her
return to England she had sustained no damage, and was perfectly ready
to proceed on active service to any part of the world." Sir
J. Pakington read a letter, handed to him by a friend and written by
Commander Tryon, of the Warrior, in which the ship was spoken of in
the highest terms. Sir J.C.D. Hay, M.P., chairman of the Iron-Plato
Committee, in the course of his remarks upon ships' armour, stated
that the report of the committee was now in the printers' hands, but
that no satisfactory conclusion had been reached as the best mode of
attaching the armour to the ship's sides. He stated, however, that the
committee were persuaded that what is called angulated sides possessed
no real advantages as compared with the usual upright sides, when all the circumstances of the case were considered.</p>

<p>At the evening meeting of the institution Mr. John Laird, M.P.,
presided; and, after giving a general description of the Merrimac and
Monitor, and exhibiting drawings of these vessels, he read an extract
from a private letter which he had received from a reliable friend at New York, to the following effect:&#x2014;"The success of the Rodman gun has induced our Government to try experiments on a scale still larger, and they are about constructing guns of 20 inches bore, throwing shot of l000lb., which, it is thought, will crush in the
 side of any iron-plated ship, no matter what the thickness of the plates. The little Monitor iron-plated gun-boat, with revolving tower, built by Ericsson, has proved a great success, and withstood a storm of shot and shell for six
hours from guns of very heavy calibre. I am quite satisfied that gun-boats
will be of more service than large ships with iron sides. We are making rapid
progress in building up a navy effective and not expensive. It is the intention to make our power on the ocean equal to that of any other nation, and then we are sure of peace from all parties."</p>

<p rend="center">IRON-CLAD SHIPS VERSUS FORTIFICATIONS.</p>

<p>Captain Coles, the inventor of the "shield-ship " (one of the most Important
features of which was pirated by Captain Ericsson in constructing the
Monitor for the Federal Government), writes to the<hi rend="italic">
Times:</hi>&#x2014;"This action (<sic>Newport's</sic> News) has proved every word that
I wrote advocating an organised coast
defence (or patrol) of iron-cased ships, in lieu of immovable forts,
which ships, if ever we possess them, must not permit a vessel to come
near our ports, but must grapple with and arrest her as the Monitor
did the Merrimac. I will, therefore, merely draw your attention to the
late Admiral Sir R. S. Dundas's  letter to the Royal Commissioners,
wherein he shows that for the estimated expense (&#xA3;840,000) of
these three forts at Spithead, twenty of our screw and now useless
line-of-battle ships could be converted into most efficient iron
blockships. I can convert into a shield-ship any of those screw
line-of-battle ships. She shall be practically invulnerable, and she
shall carry a broadside, according to her tonnage, of from twelve to
fourteen guns, 110 or 68-pounders; if 300-pounders are brought into
use, she shall carry a broadside of from five to six of them, and that
these ships shall work those heavy guns when the Warrior and such-like vessels dare not open their ports. Let me again ask if a coast patrol, as I propose, of these converted vessels, with others carrying from two guns up to twelve, would not give this country more security than these forts, which are estimated at millions, but may cost any amount before completed, and then only serve as unmistakable beacons for the enemy's iron-clad ships to pass between?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ford, of the Thames Ironworks Company, also writes to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>:&#x2014;"The exploits of the Merrimac having fully demonstrated that a vessel of war,
capable of using her prow as a means of offence, is a much more formidable opponent to the enemy than an ordinary vessel, which is not built
with a running-down stem, it will doubtless be satisfactory to the
public to know that our noble ship the Warrior, although now
presenting the graceful outline and appearance of a gigantic yacht,
is so constructed that, at the cost of a few hundred pounds, she may
be converted into an irresistible ram, fully capable of running down
any number of wooden ships without injury to herself. It is only
necessary to take away the overhanging cutwater, figurehead,
&amp;c., when a stem of gigantic proportions and enormous strength,
forged and fitted with this object, will make its appearance, and to
this the bowplates can be easily connected. The Merrimac, being a
wooden vessel, received such considerable injury to her bow, in
running down and sinking the Cumberland, as to oblige her to go into
dock for repairs; but there are so many examples of iron vessels, with
stems vastly inferior in strength to the Warrior, running down other
ships, without receiving any injury, that no such need be entertained
on her account."</p></div2>

<p>General Burnside has entered upon more of the coast of North
Carolina. Fort Macon and the town of Beaufort have been occupied by
the Federals. The town was evacuated before the Federals
approached. One account states that the steamer Nashville, which was
lately in Southampton harbour, was burnt to prevent it from falling
into the hands of the invaders; another that it was only slightly
injured, and in this state was captured.</p>

<p>Commodore Dupont is active on the eastern coast of Florida. He
has captured Fort Marion, at St. Augustine, which was surrendered
without a struggle. The inhabitants of St. Augustine hoisted the
Federal flag immediately the place was evacuated by the Confederate officers. The Commodore issued a proclamation very reassuring to the well-disposed portion of the inhabitants.</p>

movements by the American press. The<hi rend="italic"> Times</hi> special correspondent reports that the General is assembling an army at and around Fortress Monroe of at least 85,000 of the best infantry which the Federals have in the field, with upwards of 100 guns and 4000 cavalry. The navigation of the Potomac being no longer impeded by Confederate batteries,
the movement of this force from Alexandria goes on with rapidity.</p>

<p>General Shields's division of General Banks's corps-d'arm&#xE9;e
has been attacked by the Confederate General Jackson at Winchester,
the chief town of Frederick County, Virginia. The assailants numbered
15,000, the attacked 9000. The action lasted eight hours, and
terminated in the defeat of the Confederates, with a loss of about 600
men. In their flight the Confederates threw away their muskets, of
which more than 1000 have been found, and left two guns, caissons, and
several<pb n="361"/>
hundred prisoners, in the enemy's hands. On the following day the
retreating army was pursued by General Banks, who telegraphs as
follows:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">March 25. Five miles beyond Strasburg.</p>

<q><p>The enemy are still in retreat, and our forces in hot pursuit. They have
abandoned waggons along the road filled with dead and dying. The houses on
the route are found crowded with the wounded and dead. The dwellings in
the towns adjacent to the battle-field of Sunday are also found filled with
wounded. The inhabitants aided the rebel soldiers in carrying off their
wounded during the day, and in burying them quickly as soon as dead. Our
artillery makes terrible havoc among the enemy in their flight, and the rout
bids fair to be one of the most dreadful of the war.</p></q>

<p>Of the campaign in Tennessee we have nothing new. The Confederates are now said to have concentrated an army at Corinth, in
Mississippi. The Federal troops still mostly remain on board their transports.</p>

<p>Island No. 10 holds out with obstinacy, the firing continuing slowly by day and night, at intervals of half an hour.</p>

<p>The Confederates obtained a decided victory at Fort Craig, New Mexico, on the 21st of February. The Federal loss was 62 killed and 142 wounded. They also lost six guns and destroyed a large amount of property on abandoning Albuquerque.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The Tax Bill is still in Committee undergoing alterations.</p>

<p>The Senate has been debating the bill for the compensated abolition of
slavery in the district of Columbia. The opposition to the measure takes the indirect form of advocating the colonisation in tropical lands of the liberated slaves. An amendment of this nature was thrown out only by the casting vote of the Speaker, Vice-President Hamlin, the division having resulted in a tie&#x2014;19 against 19.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Mr. Yancey has not been captured, nor have three journals been
suppressed by the War Department for the improper publication of
military news, as has been reported. On the other hand, the rumour of
the death of the Confederate General Ben M'Culloch, at the battle of
Sugar Creek, in Arkansas, is confirmed, as is that which announced that Commodore Buchanan, the Commander of the Merrimac, was seriously wounded. He has since died, after having suffered amputation of the leg.</p>

<p>The import trade at New York is rapidly reviving, in spite of the
heavy tariff and other adverse circumstances.</p>

<p rend="center">A PRO-SLAVERY RIOT IN CINCINNATI.</p>

<p>Mr. Wendell Phillips, the Abolitionist leader, attempted (Monday,
March 24) to deliver a lecture at the Opera House in Cincinnati, the
chief city of the Free State of Ohio. The subsequent proceedings are thus described in the New York journals:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>Persons in the galleries then hissed, yelled, and threw eggs and
stones at him, some hitting him. The hissing was kept up some
time. Finally, he made himself heard, and proceeded until something
again objectionable was said, and again eggs were thrown, hitting
him. He persevered, and a third time was heard, and a third time
stoned and egged. The crowd now moved down stairs, crying "Put him
out!" Tar and feather him!" and giving groans for the
"nigger Wendell Phillips." They proceeded down the middle aisle
towards a stage, and were met by Phillips's friends. Here a fight
ensued amidst the greatest confusion, ladies screaming and crying,
jumping on chairs, and falling in all directions. During the fight
Phillips was taken off the stage by his friends. The audience then
moved out. It is now ten o'clock, and the streets in the vicinity of
the Opera House are crowded with excited people. They are unable to
find Phillips.</p></q>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.<lb/>GENERAL BURNSIDE.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Graphic</hi> Illustrations and a detailed account of the Federal expedition to Pamlico Sound have appeared in this Journal from the pencil and pen of our Special Artist and Correspondent, who shared in the danger of that adventure, and the first page of our present Number bears a portrait of its gallant commander.</p>

<p>Ambrose Everett Burnside was born at Liberty, Union county,
Indiana, on the 23rd of May, 1824. At the age of eighteen he was
entered at West Point, and graduated fifteenth in a class of
forty-seven members, in 1849. He was breveted Second Lieutenant in the
2nd Artillery, and was transferred the next year to the 3rd Artillery.
Joining his regiment in Mexico, he marched in Patterson's column to
the city of Mexico, where he remained till peace was
declared. Returning to the North, he was stationed at Fort Adams, in
Newport harbour. In 1849 he was attached as First Lieutenant to
Captain Bragg's battery, and was engaged for three or four years in
frontier service in New Mexico. In an engagement with the Apache
Indians in August, 1850, near <sic>Los</sic> Vegas, Lieutenant
Burnside commanded a company of twenty-nine men, who killed eighteen
Indians, took nine prisoners, and captured forty horses. For this
action he was recommended for promotion. He afterwards served as
Quartermaster to the Commission which surveyed the boundary line
between the United States and Mexico. In 1851 he crossed the plains
from the Gila River through the Indian territory, travelling twelve
hundred miles in seventeen days, with an escort of but three men, bringing
despatches from Colonel Graham to the President. Lieutenant Burnside
was next stationed at Fort Adams, and while there he resigned his
commission for the purpose of devoting his attention to the
manufacture of a breech-loading rifle of his own invention, and took
up his residence at Bristol, R.I. His new enterprise proving
unfortunate he went to Chicago, and entered the office of the Illinois
Central Railroad Company as cashier of the land department, while
George B. (now General) M'Clellan was general superintendent, and
afterwards vice-president of the company. After holding the position
of cashier for two years, Burnside was elected treasurer of the
company, and removed to New York. While acting in this capacity, soon
after the outbreak of the rebellion, he received a telegraphic
despatch from Governor Sprague notifying him that the 1st Rhode Island
Regiment of one thousand men was raised, and asking him to take the
command. In half an hour he left his office and was on his way to
Providence. The regiment was one of the first which went to
Washington, and took part in the engagement at Stone Bridge, Colonel
Burnside acting as Brigadier-General during that battle. His conduct
on that occasion commended him to the attention of the authorities at
Washington, and on the 6th of August he was appointed Brigadier-General
of Volunteers. General M'Clellan, who knows his worth and military
capacity, selected him to command the expedition to Pamlico Sound, one
of the most important expeditions projected since the commencement of
the war. The Burnside expedition, by the latest accounts, was carrying
out its plan very successfully, and had occupied Beaufort, which the
Confederates evacuated on their advance, previously blowing up Fort
Macon and burning the Nashville to hinder her falling into the hands
of the Unionists.</p>

 <p>Our correspondent bore testimony to the indomitable energy and
 judgment shown by General Burnside in the trying circumstances to
 which he was subjected during the progress of the expedition; and he
 is corroborated by the<hi rend="italic"> Philadelphia Inquirer</hi>,
 which publishes the following anecdotes of the General's conduct
 during the disastrous storm off Hatteras:&#x2014;"General Burnside was
 ubiquitous; he was everything&#x2014;everywhere. With nothing to
 distinguish him but his yellow belt, in his blue shirt, slouched hat,
 and high boots, he stood like a sea god in the bows of his light
 boat, speaking every vessel, and asking affectionately about the
 welfare of the men. His master-mind lost nothing in this time of
 terror. Suddenly learning that the troops were suffering for water he
 made the beach near Fort Clark, and, directing the work of the
 condenser there, he succeeded in preparing the sea water for drinking
 at the rate of three hundred gallons an hour, and the sun had
 scarcely set last Monday week when he had the fleet supplied. At one
 time he was begged to take some rest, but this he refused to do,
 exclaiming, 'The contractors have ruined me, but God holds me in his
 palm, and all will yet be well.' "</p>

<p rend="center">ADVANCE Of THE FEDERALS ON CENTREVILLE.</p>

<p>On the 10th ult. the advance of the Federal forces on Centreville and
Manassas took place&#x2014;the subject of the Engraving on page 362 (from a
sketch by our Special Artist) being the approach of the Union column
to the abandoned Confederate works on Centreville heights. Beyond is
seen the smoke from one of the numerous burning camps destroyed by the
Secessionists on evacuating the positions. Many of the "guns" in the
forte were dummies, being nothing more <sic>that</sic> huge painted logs placed
there as substitutes for the guns which the Confederates had been
gradually removing for the previous month. The town of Centreville, at
least the cluster of half-ruined shanties that compose it, is over the
brow of the hill, and Manassas lies seven miles further on.</p>

<p rend="center"> FEDERAL CAVALRY ENTERING MANASSAS JUNCTION DEPOT.</p>

<p>Our Special Artist has forwarded to us an Illustration, given on

page 366, of the Federal cavalry scouts entering the
D&#xE9;p&#xF4;t at Manassas Junction, on the 10th ult. The first
into Manassas was a party of cavalry scouting in advance of the Federal
columns, The d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t was found to be on fire, all kinds of stores
smouldering in heaps or lying strewed about in the greatest possible
confusion. There were great numbers of muskets, pistols, and
bowieknives&#x2014;the latter with "Yankee-slayer" engraved in large letters
on the blades&#x2014;all kinds of wearing apparel and officers' trunks, and
military stores of every description. The station was surrounded by
earthworks and fascine batteries. All the guns had been removed,
except here and there one which had tumbled into a ditch. Here, as at
Centreville, there were some sham wooden cannons. Judging from the
reckless sacrifice of stores at this place, the Confederates, during
the latter part of their retreat, must have been
panicstricken.</p>

<p rend="center">THE AMERICAN IRON-CLAD VESSELS.</p>
 <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Merrimac was formerly the United States' frigate of that name,
 which was scuttled and sunk at the Norfolk Navy-yard at the
 commencement of the rebellion by the officers of the Union Government to prevent her falling into the hands of the Confederates. She was built at
Charleston, in 1855, and was pierced for forty guns. After the
Confederates took possession of the yard, she was raised and converted
into a man-of-war for their own use. Her hull was cut down to within
three feet of her water-mark, and a bombproof house built on her
gun-deck. She was also iron-plated, and her bow and stem steel-clad,
with a projecting angle of iron for the purpose of piercing
vessels. She has no masts, and there is nothing to be seen over her
gun-deck, with the exception of her pilot-house and smokestack. Her
bombproof is three inches thick, and is made of wrought iron. Her
armament consists of four 11-inch navy guns on each side, and two guns
at the bow and stern. The Merrimac has been renamed the Virginia.</p>

<p>The turret or citadel of the Ericsson floating-battery Monitor,
which constitutes its only means of offence, consists of a rolled
plate-iron skeleton, 1in. thick, to which are riveted two thicknesses,
of 1in. each, of rolled iron plates. Outside of this again are six
plates of rolled iron, all firmly bolted together with nuts inside, so
that if a plate is started it can be at once tightened again. The
lower part of the gun-carriages consist of solid wrought-iron beams. These
are planed perfectly true, and are placed parallel in the turret, both
of the guns pointing in the same direction. The ports through the side
of the turret are only large enough to permit the muzzle of the gun to
be thrust through. Inside of them are wrought-iron pendulums, which
close them against the enemy as soon as the gun recoils. A shellproof
flat roof, of perforated plate iron, placed on forged beams, inserted
six inches down the cylinder, covers the top. The sliding hatch in
this cover is perforated to give light, and for musketry fire in case
the battery is boarded., A spur-wheel, 6&#xBD;in. in diameter,
moved by a double cylinder-engine...turns the turret, guns and all, a rod connected with the
running gear of the engine enabling the runner to control the aim. The
height of the turret is 9ft., and its diameter 21ft. 9in.</p>

<p rend="center">THE DIADEM RESCUING THE CREW OF THE C. W. CONNOR.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Her Majesty's</hi> steam frigate Diadem left Bermuda on the 11th of
March, 1862, on her homeward voyage, and the day following a dismasted
vessel was descried precisely in the frigate's track. The sky was
lowering, with spitting rain; a fresh westerly breeze soon tended to
bring the ship close upon the wreck, presenting six men standing upon
a small deckhouse, holding on by ropes, and in feebleness welcoming
the stranger with hats in hand. The sea made a complete breach over
her deck, which was almost completely submerged. A boat was quickly
lowered, and in a very short time the shipwrecked crew were placed on
board the Diadem, to enjoy the comfort and attention which the ample
resources of a British vessel of war could afford. The sequel is soon
told. The vessel, which proved to be the C. W. Connor, had sailed
from Boston for St. Jago de Cuba with a cargo of timber, brandy,
potatoes, and "notions," and had proceeded prosperously until a very
heavy gale of wind overtook the ill-fated ship, throwing her on her
beamends; nothing was left but to cut away the masts, yet this was not
accomplished until she filled with water. Owing to the buoyancy of her
cargo she escaped sinking altogether. In this condition the crew,
consisting of the master and five men, had remained for five days
exposed to the roll of the Atlantic, with no other food than biscuit
wetted with saltwater, and what rain water they could lick from off
the deckhouse upon which they stood. One man was washed overboard five
times, and on each occasion was regained by his comrades in
distress. The Diadem, in the course of her voyage, fell in with the
American ship Annapolis, bound to the United States, to which the
abandoned ship's crew were transferred, carrying with them a liberal
subscription from the officers and ship's company, and the hearty
wishes of all for their better fortune.</p>

<p rend="center">OUR AMERICAN BROTHERS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> any two nations in the world ought
thoroughly to understand and respect each other it is Great Britain
and the United States of America. There is no natural, and there ought
to be no political or social, cause of hostility or even of jealousy
between them. Their material interests do not conflict or clash. They
are so situated as regards climate and development that whatever the
one cultivates or produces in the greatest superabundance the other
has both the desire and the means of purchasing or exchanging. England
wants cotton and breadstuffs, and America wants the loan of realised capital to make her roads and canals,
and turn to remunerative account the prodigality of Nature, and thus
they play, or ought to play, into each other's hands. It may further
be said that, were it not for the vast resources and all but boundless
territories of the United States, England might occupy a position in
Europe more commensurate with her superficial extent in acres than
with her moral and intellectual grandeur; and, on the other hand, it
may be said with equal truth that were it not for the teeming
population of our isles, spreading themselves in their restless
cupidity over the forests and prairies of the Western World in search
of the subsistence or the wealth denied them at home by paucity of
space and the keenness of competition, the American Union might still
be, as it was in the days of Washington and Franklin, a strip of land
upon the seaboard, with the uncleared wilderness and the tomahawking
savage behind it. England and the United States are severally such
formidable members of the great comity of civilised nations that no
single Power on the globe would be rash enough to force an unjust
quarrel upon either. Were they as intimately united as their
consanguinity and their commercial interdependence dictate that they
should be, they might be the arbiters of humanity and shape the course
of civilisation. The statesman and philosopher who dispassionately
surveys them sees nothing that ought to dissever them. They are the
two most active, enterprising, and vigorous nations which the world
has ever known. They carry on the largest trade and occupy the most
commanding positions in both hemispheres. They speak the same
language, they are fed upon the same traditions, they draw their
maxims of conduct in this life and their hopes of eternal happiness in
the next from the same Bible, and are,in fact, but twin branches of
the one prolific tree of liberty that first flourished as a sapling a
thousand years ago in our little island of Britain. Why, then, should
there be any ill-feeling or antagonism between them? Why should the
Americans be so extraordinarily sensitive to British criticism on
their doings?  And why should British opinion, seeing their
sensitiveness, strive so unwisely to provoke them by ill-timed and
unfair comment? The explanation is to be found in their mutual
ignorance of each other's feelings and modes of thought. America does
not understand England, and England does not understand America. Such
is the fact, reason upon it as we may. Each nation is so engrossed
with its own affairs, and exaggerates so unduly its own importance, in
this great cosmopolitan age, that it has neither the time nor the
disposition to study the events of the outlying world with the care
that they demand; and both are so dazzled, or we might say dazed, by
their own glory, that they do not look out into the clear daylight
that lies beyond to take the true measurement of the great events that
occur beyond the comparatively narrow boundaries of their own
circle.</p>

<p>During the progress of the deplorable civil war, that now
seems drawing to a close, on the other side of the Atlantic, we
do not think that our American brothers have done full justice
either to the British people or their Government. We on this
side were naturally interested in the result of the struggle. It
not only appealed to our social and political sympathies, but it
deeply affected our interests. The first impression was that the
Southern people and their leaders were mad in their attempt to
separate from the Union; and that the North would be able to reannex
them in three months if they carried their threat of secession into
effect. As time wore on this impression was weakened, and the opinion
gained ground<pb n="384"/>that the South was more thoroughly in
earnest than we in England had been led to believe; that the North was
divided on the question of negro slavery; that the millions of the
South, animated by one immutable purpose and by one all-engrossing
desire, could not be subdued; and that if, contrary to expectation,
they would ultimately be reduced to subjection by force of arms, the
North would have a greater difficulty in afterwards discovering how
to deal with them&#x2014;their peculiar institution and their constitutional
liberty&#x2014;than it had in conquering them. But in all these opinions
there was nothing that ought to have given the North offence. Such
opinions may have been founded in error, but they did not take their
rise either in jealousy or malevolence, and ought to have been
received in America with the respect which free men always accord to
free opinion, even when it may chance to differ from their own. And if
the British people misinterpreted the sentiments of the Americans with
regard either to slavery or secession, the Americans very palpably
misinterpreted those of the British people and Government in the
affair of the Trent. In their ignorance of the real state of the case,
and altogether forgetful of the fact that the first move was made by
an American officer, they accused the British nation of attempting to
fix a quarrel upon them in the day when their whole energies were
employed in the suppression of a gigantic rebellion against the unity
of the Republic, than which nothing could be more opposite to the
fact. Had there been a war between the two nations for the principle
involved in the seizure of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, the British
people would certainly have gone into it with a resolute, but just as
certainly with a sorrowful, spirit; and, even when fighting it, would
have confessed that it was the most unnatural war in which they were
ever engaged, and one to avert which they would have made any possible
sacrifice short of their honour. If to other nations we yield little,
to America we yield much&#x2014;not because we fear, but because we love her;
just as in the smaller world of society a man will endure from his
brother what he would not suffer a stranger so much as to hint at.</p>  

 <p>We are glad, however, to observe signs that the clouds of this
 mutual misconception are clearing up. The Americans are forbearing to
 boast and taunt, and the English to carp and criticise; and, as a
 necessary consequence, there will grow up between them, as one result
 of the great rebellion, a better and truer appreciation of acts and
 motives on both sides. And although no student of contemporary
 history can fail to note that much acerbity of feeling has been
 displayed by Americans towards Great Britain, or that threats the
 reverse of decent or friendly have been used with reference to Canada
 and the British possessions, to take effect after the North and the
 South shall have made up their feud (if ever that is to be), it is
 clear when it comes to questions of facts that there is a kindly
 feeling towards England at the bottom of all this bitterness; that
 America does not care who has a bad opinion of her if England have a
 good one; and that, if our public writers and speakers would adopt in
 their criticisms on American affairs a tone somewhat more kindly, the
 Americans would be glad to reciprocate the good feeling. Such a
 furore of gladness and delight as was displayed in New York when the
 submarine wires flashed from land to land under the waves of the
 Atlantic, their first and almost their only messages, could not have
 been exhibited by a people who in their hearts hated the country from
 which the messages came. And, more recently, such a hearty and
 imperial reception as was bestowed on the Prince of Wales when he
 visited the cities of the Union could not have been given with such a
 spontaneity and exuberance of enthusiasm if the Americans, in spite
 of all that their newspapers may allege to the contrary, had not
 really loved and respected the green old land where their forefathers
 were born, and whose language, literature, and laws they have
 inherited. Deeds like these neutralise
 the bad effects of a whole wilderness of hostile newspaper articles
 and buncombe speeches, and ought to be the real tests of national sentiment between two such communities.</p>

<p>The American civil war has already taught the British people to respect more than ever the high qualities of their Transatlantic brothers. It has proved that they are men who can do, as well as talk of doing; and that they are in all respects the gallant sons of worthy sires in whom the race has not degenerated. And if, at the Great International Exhibition, now so soon to open its doors to the products and to the representatives of the whole civilised world, the space reserved for the art and industry of the United States be left partially or wholly vacant, there is no true Englishman who will not deplore the fact and its causes, or form any other wish for the Americans than that their first civil war may be their last; that they may emerge from its sore trial purified as well as chastened, and be&#x2014;as they were before its outburst&#x2014;a free, a happy, and a united people.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS.</hi><lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Nova Scotian we
have news to the evening of the 5th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>So rigid is the censorship exercised by the United States' Government 
over every channel of intelligence which may give the enemy any
inkling of their movements that the soldiers of the army of the Potomac have been forbidden even to write home to their friends. Under these circumstances nothing more is known of their movements than that the transportation of forces from Alexandria down  the Potomac continues. On the 26th ult. the Confederates were driven from Warrenton Junction, ten miles beyond Manassas, and crowded steadily back until they were forced to cross the Rappahannock towards Gordonsville. They blew up the railroad-bridge behind them to stop further pursuit. There are now believed to be no Confederates between the Federals and the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>Fugitive negroes arriving at Fortress Monroe from Norfolk state
that the Merrimac had been repaired and brought out of dry deck; that her crew had gone on board, and that she was now ready for action. Several new guns of heavier metal had been placed on board. The steamers Jamestown and Yorktown are being more thoroughly iron-clad at Richmond to accompany the Merrimac on her neat adventure.</p>

<p>From the coast of North Carolina there is nothing new. From
Georgia we learn that the Confederates have withdrawn all their forces from the coast and taken all their guns to Savannah; and that Fort Pulaski, at the mouth of the Savannah River, has been closely invested by the Federals. The Confederates have sunk the celebrated yacht America in St. John's River, Florida.</p>

 <p>A portion of General Banks's force had arrived at Manassas after a
tedious march from Winchester. During their march they encountered no portion of the Confederate forces.</p>

<p>There is nothing new from Tennessee. The Federals occupy the line of the Tennessee River as far south as  Eastport in Mississippi. The Confederate line of defence has for its base the Charleston and Memphis Railroad, and extends from Chattanooga, in Tennessee, to Corinth and Memphis. Beauregard is in command of this department. His head-quarters are at Corinth. A Federal correspondent writes:&#x2014;"In two days last week our scouts saw fifteen
trains, laden with soldiers, enter the town. Many of their troops are supposed to be raw militia, half armed and unorganised, that have been gathered by the recent levies; but the numbers are becoming formidable: 60,000 is the lowest figure to which the official information will reduce them."</p>

<p>The siege of Island No. 10 had continued without any important change. The mortars fire every half hour, but elicit no response.</p>

<p>In Arkansas the army under General Curtis had fallen back as far

as Cross Timber Hollows, on account of a scarcity of forage where

they were previously stationed. The Confederates under Price and

Van Dorn had retreated entirely across the Boston Mountains, and

were at Van Buren and Fort Smith, receiving supplies by way of the

Arkansas River.</p>

<p>It seems that, notwithstanding the statements to the contrary published by the authority of the Federal Censor, the Nashville escaped from Beaufort, her superior speed enabling her to escape from the two vessels set to watch her. Secretary Welles is much blamed for this result.</p>

<p>There is no news from New Orleans, where an attack had been daily anticipated for the past fortnight, Major-General Lovell had proclaimed martial law there.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>In the Richmond Congress, on the 12th ult., a joint resolution,
advising planters to abstain from planting cotton and tobacco this year and devote themselves exclusively to the production of grain and provisions, was defeated by a majority of 3; the vote being, Yeas, 8; Nays, 11.</p>

<p>A member had introduced a resolution advising the Executive to
withdraw the Commissioners from England and abandon further attempts to obtain British recognition.</p>

<p>In reply to a communication from General Johnson, the loyal but intruded Governor of Tennessee, requiring the municipal officers of Nashville to take the oath of allegiance to the United States, the city officials replied:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>We respectfully ask to be excused from taking the oath sent us, honestly believing that under the Constitution and the Charter we are not properly subject to such requirement, and believing that the same was made of us under a misapprehension of what was required of us heretofore."</p></q>

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL CONGRESS.</p>

<p>The Senate has passed the resolution to co-operate with States desiring to emancipate slaves by a vote of 32 to 10. The minority were
mainly senators from the Border States. The Senate has also passed the
bill for the abolition of slavery in the district of Columbia by 29
against 14 votes. A compensation averaging 300 dollars for each slave
is to be paid to the slaveowners. 100,000 dollars is appropriated to
aid the voluntary emigration of the emancipated slaves to Hayti and Liberia. The number of slaves in the district is about 3000. This important measure has yet to pass through the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives is discussing the provisions of the
Tax Bill.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The War Department has ordered all farther recruiting for the

Federal army to cease.</p>

<p>An army cartridge manufactory exploded in Philadelphia on the 29th

ult., by which upwards of fifty persons of both sexes were either
killed or mangled.</p></div2>

<p>A deputation from the British and Foreign  Anti-Slavery

Society waited upon Mr. Adams, the American Minister, on Wednesday,
and presented a highly-appropriate address to his Excellency. They congratulated him upon being the representative of a Government which was now adopting

 decided measures to abolish slavery and the slave trade, and they expressed

 the hope that the restoration of the Union would be founded upon the
abolition of "the true cause of strife." Mr. Adams made a brief but
suggestive reply. He expressed his sympathy with the anti-slavery
sentiments of the deputation, and his trust that as a means of safety
the nefarious institution would be extirpated. Upon the subject of the
slave trade his reply was equally satisfactory.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATION OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.<lb/>RECONNAISSANCE BY GENERAL STONEMAN.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">On</hi> the 14th inst., immediately after the
occupation  of Manassas Junction by the Federalists, a strong
reconnaissance of cavalry and
infantry, under the command of General Stoneman, accompanied by
the two Orleanist princes, started on the track of the retreating
Secessionists. They pushed on as far as Cedar Run, about twenty-seven
miles from the junction, driving in the enemy's pickets which they
fell in with in the neighbourhood. The subject chosen for illustration in the Engraving on page 403 is the halt of the party and the examination of escaped contrabands (slaves) from Gordonsville, the present
head-quarters of the Confederate army of the Potomac.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Jura we have news from New York to the afternoon of the 12th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>On the 10th the Merrimac, with several gun-boats and tugs, reappeared at Newport News and Sewell's Point, and captured three small vessels. The Federal iron-clad steamers, Nangatuck and Monitor, fired four shots at the Merrimac, which thereupon retired to Craney Island.</p>

<p>The British steamer Phaeton is reported to have arrived at the mouth
of the Rio Grande. The Commander is said to have stated that his
mission was to keep open the navigation of the Rio Grande at all
hazards. The Rio Grande divides the State of Texas from Mexico. It was at the port of Metamoras, on this river, that the British steamer Labuan was wrongfully captured a few weeks since.</p>

<p>The Federal army under General M'Clellan arrived in front of the 
Confederate works at Yorktown on the 5th inst. General M'Clellan
reports that "the position of the rebels is a strong one. From
present indications their fortifications extend some two miles in
length and mount heavy guns. The ground in front of their heavier guns
is low and swampy, making it impassable."</p>

<p>The Federals commenced an attack with artillery, which was replied to by the Confederate batteries. The cannonading on both sides was without material result. The latest accounts estimate the Confederate forces at 60,000, and represent their intrenchments as stretching entirely across Yorktown peninsula, from James to York River.</p>

<p>At Pittsburg Landing, near Corinth, has been fought the bloodiest battle which ever took place on United States' soil. On Sunday
morning, the 6th instant, the Confederates under Beauregard and
Johnstone fell on General Grant's division with great fury. They drove
in the left wing of the Federals, commanded by General Prentiss, and
captured the commander. By five o'clock in the afternoon the
Confederates occupied two-thirds of the Federal camp, and bade fair to
drive them into the river. A Federal account says: "Our condition at
this moment was extremely critical. Large numbers of men panicstruck,
others worn out by hard fighting, with the average percentage of
skulkers, had straggled towards the river and could not be rallied."
The Federal artillery now stood them in good stead, and enabled them,
with the aid of two gun-boats which now came up, to hold their ground
till nightfall. During the night both forces lay on their arms on the
field. Before dawn large reinforcements, headed by General Buell,
reached the exhausted Unionists. The latter now became the assailants,
and their artillery made terrible havoc in the enemy's
ranks. Reinforcements continued to arrive, and at 3p.m. General Grant
ordered the decisive charge. At 5.30 the Confederates were in full
retreat for their strong position at Corinth, pursued by the Federal
cavalry. No official accounts have yet been published, but the
Federals admit a loss of 7000, including 2000 prisoners. General
Beauregard,in his report of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> day's battle, says, "We gained a complete victory. General Albert Sydney Johnston was killed while leading the troops in the thickest of the fight." </p>

 <p>The Federals have occupied Huntsville, in Alabama, and have landed

and cut the wires of the telegraph between New Orleans and Mobile.</p>

<p>Island No.10 has at last fallen, but not until, by cutting a canal and

running two gun-boats past the Confederate batteries to New Madrid,
the Federals threatened to take the island in the rear. General
Halleck thus recapitulates the success, which was won without the loss
of a single life:&#x2014;</p>

<p>General Pope has captured three Generals, 6000 prisoners of war, 100
siege-pieces and several field batteries, with immense quantities of smallarms,
tents, waggons, and horses.</p>
<p>The floating battery of the Confederates, and several of their
transports, steamers, and gun-boats, have also fallen into the hands of 
the victors. In consequence of this event Memphis lies at the mercy of the Federals.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>A sudden enthusiasm for ironplated gun-boats has arisen. The
Charlestonians have subscribed nearly 4,000,000 dols. for the gun-boat fund, and ladies have sent watches, chains, and jewellery to be raffled for with the same object. Throughout the Gulf States church bells, old brass, clockweights, and lead-piping, are sent in daily for cannon and bullets. The British steamer Economist has arrived at a Southern port with a valuable cargo of military stores.</p>

<p>A cruel civil war is raging in the interior of Tennessee between the native Unionists (many of whom are returned exiles) and the Secessionists. Neighbours were daily killing each other in casual rencontres.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The news from the capital is more than usually important. President
Lincoln has issued a proclamation for a day of thanksgiving for the
late victories, and on account of the danger of foreign intervention
and invasion having been averted from the country, and had submitted to Congress a new treaty between Great Britain and the United States regarding the suppression of the slave trade.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill for the abolition of  slavery in the district of Columbia by 93 to 39. It has also sent the  Tax Bill up to the Senate.</p>

<p>The Senate has passed the bill removing all disability from coloured
persons to carry the mails.</p>

<p>Lord Edward Cavendish, Lord Cecil, and Colonel Percy had arrived at
Washington; and Mr. W. H. Russell, the special correspondent of
the<hi rend="italic"> Times</hi>, had left for England in consequence
of the discourtesy manifested towards him by the military authorities
in ejecting him, his waggon, and his baggage from the steam-boat which was taking
him and others to Fortress Monroe, where he intended to have followed  the fortunes of the army now before Yorktown.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The people of Western Virginia have voted in favour of emancipating
their slaves on the terms offered by the Federal Government.</p> 

<p>Colonel Michael Doheny, a Young Ireland leader in 1846-8, died in
Brooklyn in the early part of this month.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.<lb/><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right">Washington, April 11.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> a few hours after dispatching this
letter I shall have shaken the dust from my feet and departed in
sorrow from a neighbourhood and army with both of which I have been
associated for months. With one exception (my accompanying the
Burnside expedition), I have sought my fortune with the soldiers of
the Potomac; and, indeed, so thoroughly had I become identified with
them that numbers of the officers and&#x2014;I am not ashamed to say it&#x2014;men
looked upon me as an old friend, and I was proud of the position I had
achieved among them. Here is the cause of our separation at a moment
when I could most have done my former comrades justice by illustrating
their feats of arms in the open field:&#x2014;
A few days before the final departure of the great expedition to
Fortress Monroe the Comte de Paris came to me with an invitation from
General M'Clellan to accompany his force; and at the same time he
charged me with a similar message for Mr. Russell (who has returned to
England in disgust at what afterwards occurred). Two days later the
Comte de Paris again called on me, bringing with him the following
pass, which had been made out at the direction of Major-General M'Clellan:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">Head Quarters Army of the Potomac, March 28, l862.</p>

<p rend="right">By command, R. B. <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcy</hi>, Chief of Staff.</p>

<p>Having made every preparation for what I presumed would be a campaign extending over a couple of months, I thought to embark on one of the numerous transports leaving Alexandria, but found that an order from the War Department issued subsequently to the receipt by me of the above pass prohibiting the presence of unofficial persons on any of the vessels prevented my accompanying the expedition.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I leave this evening for the West, and
in the course of three or four days hope to reach Corinth. The field
will be quite a new one, and, should I not be followed there with the
ban of the Secretary of War upon me, I hope to send you much that will
be interesting to your readers. The Western men are proving themselves
the heroes of the war, and it appears to me that the opening of the
Mississippi will tend greatly to decide the vexed question of
Secession that at present divides the North from the South.<hi rend="right">F. V.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, APRIL</hi> 26, 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Making</hi> all allowance for the evident
exaggeration of the telegram news, we may be sure that the Americans
have fought a very terrible battle, in which the amount of slaughter
has been such as to make good men shudder and ask whether the time is
not nearly at hand when disinterested mediation may be accepted. On
the 6th the Confederates, under Beauregard, attacked the Federals near
Corinth. If a reader will take the map and follow the course of the
Mississippi to Memphis he will see, a little to the right, and before
arriving at the Tennessee River, the site where this sanguinary
engagement took place. The first portion of the battle was all in
favour of the Southerners, who took the enemy's positions, inflicting
heavy loss, and taking a great number of prisoners. But the fearful struggle was renewed next day, the North being strongly reinforced, and the Confederates were overpowered, and in their turn sustained great slaughter, losing many prisoners.</p>

<p>The Federals have an indisputable triumph on the River Mississippi. The Island "No. 10" has been captured, with a great number of prisoners, and important stores and munition of war. Mere bombardment has been ineffectual, when a bold and clever act of engineering gave the victory to the North. A new channel was hastily cut through some swampy soil, and this enabled gun-boats to be brought to a point whence their fire must have been fatal. The Southern Commander perceived the impending checkmate and surrendered. The loss of life in this Island affair seems to have been trifling.</p>

<p>But the eyes of America are now upon a third point. General
M'Clellan and the army of the Potomac had advanced upon Yorktown, and
it was stated that they speedily discovered that the defences of the
Southerners had been sadly underrated. This is the way to Richmond,
but it promised to be no easy route. The last authentic advices
represent General M'Clellan as about to attack in force, and in the
meantime to be exchanging a harmless-cannonade; but a "rumour" has
been brought over that he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> attacked, and that the Federals had been repulsed with severe loss. The truth is eagerly looked for.</p>

<p>Meantime, and we record the fact with a satisfaction alloyed only
by the necessity of recognising the terrible conditions amid which the work has been done, the House of Representatives has adopted, by 93 to 39, a resolution for the appointment of a committee to inquire into the practicability of a plan for the gradual emancipation of slaves and extinction of slavery in Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri. Whether this particular project be carried or not, here is a direct condemnation of slavery by the House of Commons of the North, and the inestimable moral value of such a demonstration must be clear to all the world. First by President Lincoln, next by the Representatives, has the slave system been branded as the accursed thing to be got rid of as soon as Providence shall permit. It was believed that the Senate would be of the same mind. These facts are a noble consolation amid the hideous features of this awful war, and it does not become Englishmen to be unmindful of the progress of liberty or to withhold a generous tribute from those who, in so dark an hour, are mindful of their duty to humanity.</p></div2>

<p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">Tolerably</hi> good notion of the strength
of the Confederate works at Centreville may be obtained from our
Engraving on page <sic corr="418">410</sic>, from a sketch by our

links of rifle-pits and covered ways which extend along the crests of
hills for an immense distance, making the position seemingly
impregnable with good troops to hold it. The fortifications at
Manassas are nothing in comparison with these. Centreville heights is
the place which has held the Federal army in check for more than eight
months. In two of the embrasures shown in our Illustration are two of
the famous "quaker" guns, made of logs, which the Con-<pb n="418"/>
federates, by way of joke, leave in place of the genuine articles when
they evacuate their stronghold. Protected by the lines is a hutted
camp for an entire division, and of these camps there are sufficient
to provide quarters for over 100,000 men.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Recapture of a Prize.</hi>&#x2014;A merchant
ship of 884 tons, the Emily St. Pierre, which was captured off
Charleston by the Federal ship James Adger, ran into Liverpool on
Monday, her crew having recaptured her. When the ship was taken most
of the crew were transferred to the Florida, and a prize crew of
sixteen men, under a Lieutenant Stone, was sent on board. The captain
states that the moment he was aware of the intention of leaving him on
board the Emily St. Pierre he came to the determination that the
vessel should not be taken to Philadelphia, and resolved that he would
recapture her, if practicable, and bring her into a British port. He
inquired of the cook and steward whether they would assist him in his
efforts to retake her. One of them at once consented to do so, but the
other deliberated upon his conduct. Afterwards, however, he also
agreed to assist the captain. The captain turned over in his mind the
best means of effecting his object, and soon came to a conclusion as
to the best course to be adopted in the emergency. The prizemaster's
mate was asleep in the cabin on the morning of the second day after
the capture, and he determined to secure him in the first
instance. The cook and steward were armed, and were instructed by
Captain Wilson of the course they were to adopt. Some cloth was thrown
over this officer's head; his arms were secured by Captain Wilson, and
irons placed upon his hands; and he was also prevented from creating
any alarm by a gag being placed in his mouth. Captain Wilson returned
to the deck, and, in a familiar manner, inquired from the master of
the prize crew, "Well, Stone, what is the position of the ship?" The
officer replied that they were somewhere off Hatteras, and were about
to change the course. The captain invited Lieutenant Stone into the
cabin to prick upon the chart the vessel's position. Lieutenant Stone
accompanied the captain into the cabin; the door was closed, and, the
cook and steward being also present, Captain Wilson drew a belaying
pin&#x2014;he did not take a pistol, as he was anxious to prevent any
noise&#x2014;and demanded that Lieutenant Stone should quietly consent
to a pair of irons being placed upon his hands. In the presence of
such a force, the officer was compelled to submit to being placed in
irons, and also to a gag being inserted in his mouth. The master
prizeman being thus secured in the cabin, Captain Wilson returned on
deck, where he met three of the prize crew; and one being a very
powerful fellow he was doubtful as to his treatment of these men, who
were still, in common with the rest of the crew, in ignorance of the
proceedings below. Captain Wilson's ready wit, however, soon suggested
an expedient. He ordered them to go aft and get out of a scuttle a
coil of rigging, of which Lieutenant Stone was represented as being in
need. The three men, suspecting nothing, entered the scuttle; but as
soon as they were within the hatch was placed over the egress, and
they were thus imprisoned. In the meantime the forecastle-door had
been fastened up, and <sic corr="in">iu</sic> this manner the whole of
the watch below was prevented from taking any part in the
affray. Still the other men of the prize crew were unconscious of what
was going forward; and the captain sent forward one of his men to ask
whether they would assist in navigating the ship to a British port, as
he was determined that she should not go to Philadelphia. One man
consented to assist him; others, who refused, were placed with the
three men in the scuttle. After the men on deck had been disposed of
in this manner, the watch below were brought out of the forecastle one
by one, and interrogated as to whether or not they would assist
Captain Wilson in navigating the vessel. Three consented in the whole
to this course; but only one of these was a sailor, the others being
landsmen. In the course of a few days, however, two more of the
prizemen expressed their willingness to assist Captain Wilson; but one
of the men was afterwards confined in consequence of violence. With
this slender crew Captain Wilson was compelled to navigate his ship to
Liverpool, and in the course of the voyage encountered a furious gale,
which broke the tiller; but in this emergency also the ingenuity of
Captain Wilson was equal to the occasion. The serious defect was
remedied, and the vessel was safely
brought to Liverpool.</p></div2>

<p>Corinth, at which the grand army of the Confederates, under General
Beauregard, has taken up a position to oppose the Southern march of
the Union forces, is at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio and
Memphis and Charleston Railways, in Tishomingo county, 93 miles from
Memphis, 40 miles from Grand Junction; 150 miles from Columbus,
Kentucky; 58 miles from Jackson, Tennessee, 80 miles from Decatur,
Alabama; and about 20 miles in a direct line from Savannah,
Tennessee. From Pittsburg the distance to Corinth is about 18 miles,
by a good turnpike road. Corinth is an important strategical point. It
is situated in a hilly, semi-mountainous country, a branch of the
<sic>Apalachian</sic> range, which diverges from the
<sic>Alleghany</sic> Mountains, and forms the mountains and
gold-bearing regions of Georgia and Alabama. The village is nearly
surrounded by an irregular circle of hills, rising on the north, about
four miles distant, with the State line between Tennessee and
Mississippi crossing their summit. The Mobile and Ohio Railway crosses
this ridge through a cut 75ft. in depth. Similar cuts, of lesser
depth, penetrate the hills on the east, west, and south, where the
railways enter. Beyond these hills, in the direction of Pittsburg and
Savannah, the ground becomes more level, and much of it is low and
swampy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the City of Baltimore we have news from New
York to the evening of the 18th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>Fort Pulaski and its garrison, on the Savannah River, surrendered
unconditionally to the Federals on the 11th ult. Seven large breaches
were made in the walls by the Federal batteries of Parrott guns at King's Landing, and all the barbette guns on that side, and three casemate guns, were dismounted. The loss on both sides was only one man killed and three wounded. Pulaski is eighteen miles above the city of Savannah, which can now be reached by the Federal gun-boats.</p>

<p>Accounts from the South state that the Federals have attacked
Forts Jackson and Philip, which guard the approaches to New Orleans.</p>
<p>There has been fighting between the main armies near Yorktown.
On the one side the Federal gun-boats had shelled Yorktown without
effect; on the other, the Confederates had made a sortie in strong force
with the object of turning the left flank of the Federal army. General M'Clellan telegraphs to the Federal Government that the Confederates were repulsed by General Smith. President Davis is reported to be in command of the Southern forces.</p>  

<p> The Merrimac has made no further sortie.</p>

<p>General Beauregard's official report of the second day's battle at
Pittsburg Landing is to this effect:&#x2014;</p>

<p rend="right">Corinth, Tuesday, April 8.</p>

<p>To the Secretary of War, Richmond.&#x2014;We have gained a great and glorious
victory. Eight or ten thousand prisoners and thirty-six pieces of cannon.
Buell reinforced Grant, and we retired to our intrenchments at Corinth, which
we can hold. Loss heavy on both sides.  BEAUREGARD.</p>

<p>The Federal War Department flatly denies the truth of this report.
The official report of General Grant, the Federal commander, after describing the first day's fight, says:&#x2014;</p>

<p>During the night all was quiet: and, feeling that a great moral advantage
would be gained by being the attacking party, an advance was ordered
as soon as the day dawned. The result was the gradual repulse of the
enemy at all points of the line, from nine o'clock till probably five
o'clock in the afternoon, when it became evident that the enemy was
retreating. My force was too much fatigued, from two days' hard
fighting and exposure in the open air to a drenching rain during the intervening night, to pursue immediately. General Sherman, however, followed the enemy, finding that the main part of their army had retreated in good order.</p>

<p>It estimates the Federal loss at 1500 killed and 3500 wounded. It says nothing of those who may be "missing." It admits a heavy loss of artillery, and more than 200 artillery horses.</p>

<p>The Confederate army has its head-quarters at the foot of Pea
Ridge, extending two miles from Corinth. The advanced Federal
forces are eight miles from Pittsburg, leaving only two miles between the opposing armies. An advance by the Federals may be expected
at any moment. General Halleck had arrived from St. Louis, and assumed the command.</p>

<p>A gun-boat expedition had on the night of the 12th ult. proceeded
up the Tennessee River to a point near Eastport, Mississippi, landed,
and proceeding to Bear Creek Bridge, destroyed two bridges on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. This cuts off all communication between the Confederates at Corinth with Alabama and the rest of the south, except Louisiana and Texas.</p>

<p>The Federal General Mitchell now holds 100 miles of the Memphis
 and Charleston Railroad&#x2014;from Decatur to Chattanooga. In doing
this he claims to have cut the great artery of railway communication between the Southern States.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington, had suddenly left
for Richmond vi&#xE2; Fortress Monroe. The object of his mission is the subject of much speculation. From remarks in the Richmond papers it appears that the French ship-of-war which conveyed him did not salute the Confederate flag at Norfolk or elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations, to which the new
treaty between Great Britain and the United States for the suppression
of the slave trade had been referred, have reported it back without
amendment, and with the favourable
indorsement of the committee. It is expected that it will receive the prompt sanction of the Senate.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has sent a message to Congress announcing his
signature and approval of the bill emancipating the slaves in the
district of Columbia.  In this message he says he never doubted the
constitutional authority of Congress to abolish slavery in the district, and
always desired to see the national capital freed from slavery in some
satisfactory way. Hence he never had had in his mind any question
on the subject except the one of expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances.</p>

<p>Three commissioners have been appointed to investigate and
determine the value of the slaves affected by this important
measure.</p>

<p>The United States have no bankrupt law, and the House of
Representatives have postponed the consideration of a proposed measure
of this kind until the fourth Wednesday in December.</p> 

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Subscriptions for the wounded at Pittsburg Landing are being collected
all over the Union.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron, ex-Secretary of War and newly-appointed Minister to
Russia, has been arrested in Philadelphia, on a warrant issued by the
sheriff's officers, on a complaint of Mr. Pierce Butler (husband of
Mrs. Kemble Butler) for alleged illegal arrest. Other persons who
believe themselves to have been aggrieved in the same way are eager to
punish Mr. Cameron for his arbitrary conduct. </p>

<p>The fugitive negro, or so-called "contraband," question increases
in dimensions and difficulty of solution. The further the Federal
armies invade the soil of the Confederate States the more numerous
become the black refugees who seek shelter beneath their
banner. Senator Grimes, from Iowa, has made a speech in the Senate in
favour of garrisoning the Southern ports with blacks during the
unhealthy season. Public opinion is, however, not yet prepared to give
its assent to such a bold proposition. More in harmony with it is the
President's reply to the committee of the Freedmen's Association:&#x2014;"I
am entirely satisfied that no man who becomes for the time free within
the American lines will ever be re-enslaved. Rather than have it so, I would give up and abdicate."</p>

<p>The Californian Legislature has passed an Act levying a tax of 30
dollars per annum on all the Chinese in the State, as well labourers
as those washing in the mines. This tax was formerly imposed only on

Chinese miners.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY,
MAY</hi> 3,1862.</p>

<p>...The principal item in the American despatches is one of
correction. Upon obtaining something like truth in reference to the
great battles of the 6th and 7th of April, near Corinth, it becomes
quite clear that General Beauregard obtained a signal victory on the
Sunday, but by no means evident that General Grant did anything on the
Monday beyond presenting himself, reinforced, in such strength that
Beauregard did not deem it meet to attack him again. But the
Southerners had secured nearly 10,000 prisoners and many guns, and had
retired slowly into safe intrenchments. These facts it was not
natural that the Federals should be in a hurry to promulgate, and
therefore we have had to wait until a comparison of details enabled us
to shape the whole story into a reasonable form. The fights on both
days were very fierce, and the slaughter was terrible. But the first
time that Beauregard has had a chance of closing with his enemy (the
great old chance that would have given Washington to the South having
been thrown away), he has done his work with a dash that has been
strangely wanting to the history of the campaign. The position of the
Southern Confederacy has been much improved by the events of the last
month, and it would seem that it will not be very long before there is
an attempt made to terminate this fratricidal war by a mediation that
will imply recognition. The position of General McClellan before Yorktown does not appear to have improved, but it was thought that the prospects of his enemies at Washington had improved very much, and that the intrigues directed against him would be successful. If he storms the Southern defences all will go well with him, but let him be repulsed, and then see how long King Mob will remember that M'Clellan made an army out of a brave rabble. The Merrimac is now represented as worth 50,000 men, and the other day she careened about in defiance while her consorts captured several Federal vessels in the sight of the English and French ships, the Union force allowing the capture to be made without interference, which forbearance is called by a less civil name by the journals that dare to speak out.</p></div2>

<p>Accounts have been received of the wreck of an American
vessel, the Thirty-nine States, off the north-western part of Spain, when twelve of her crew perished. She had sailed from Cardiff for Genoa, laden with coal, but encountered a severe storm on her voyage, and was driven ashore near Vigo. The captain and some of the crew got into the boat, but the remainder, twelve in number, were afraid to venture and remained on board. The boat
got safely to land; the ship was dashed to pieces.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> account of the arrival on the 5th
ult. of the Federal army under General M'Clellan in front of the
Confederate works at Yorktown appeared in our last Impression, and
possibly before we go to press with the present Number news will have
arrived of a deadly encounter having taken place between the hostile
hosts. Large Confederate reinforcements have arrived at Yorktown, and
it is reported that the siege and the defence will be on an extensive
scale. Our Special Artist in America, before leaving Washington for
the West, forwarded some Illustrations in connection with the
Embarkation of the Army of the Potomac, one of which is given
below. This expedition was for some time shrouded in considerable
secrecy. Mr. Russell, the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent,
in a short letter dated March 25, "written amid the troubles of
arranging for a passage with the expedition" (which, however, it is
now well known neither he nor our Special Artist was allowed to take),
says:&#x2014;"Every day troops are starting from Alexandria for
Fortress Monroe. There are now about 38,000 or 40,000 men assembled
near Old Point Comfort, in addition to the force under General Wool,
and about 45,000 are following, so that M'Clellan will take the field
at the head of at least 85,000 of the best infantry which the United
States have in the field, with upwards of 100 guns and 4000 cavalry."
A hundred thousand men are now transported a distance of 250 miles in
a day. The army of the Potomac (says the <hi rend="italic">New York
Daily Tribune</hi>) began to move down the Potomac the 17th of
March. Innumerable vessels had been quietly chartered by the
Government for this service, river and lake steamers, almost of all
sorts and sizes, from those familiar with the waters of the Penobscot
to Chesapeake Bay, insomuch that their living freight must have been
curiously reminded of the familiar geographical localities which had
furnished recruits for such an armada. For three weeks subsequent
Alexandria the Dreary was musical and clangorous with military bands;
its miry and decayed streets echoed to the tramp of martial feet;
bayonets gleamed and flashed in its dingy thoroughfares; and trains of
artillery, waggons, and ambulances, all bound riverward, indicated the
long-desired advance of that army to which had been assigned the
crowning achievements of the war. The innumerable vessels engaged in
transporting four of the five great divisions of the army of the
Potomac to Old Point Comfort accomplished their task more or less
successfully in the alternately good and bad weather characterising
the fickle month of March. There were days of bright sunlight, and
solemn, beautiful, star-bespangled nights, days of sharp wind and
fierce driving rain, days and nights of absolute storm; perilling both
the vessels and the freighting souls within them. The supposed plan of
operations, according to the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, was as
follows:&#x2014;" First, the successful, rapid, and, if possible,
secret transmission of four or five of the great corps-d'arm&#xE9;e
of the Potomac&#x2014;namely, M'Dowell's, Sumner's, Heintzelman's, and
Keyes's&#x2014;to Fortress Monroe, Hampton, and Newport News. Secondly the
gradual occupation of the troops of the plateau in the rear of
Hampton, hitherto ranged at will by the rebel cavalry, having their
base of operations at Yorktown, under Magrader, the early arrivals
advancing inland, the later following and filling up the space vacated
by them. Next the stretching out of the lines towards Newmarket
Bridge, frequent reconnaissances in force to and beyond Big and Little
Bethel to Black River. Then the seizure of Yorktown. Finally, either
the simultaneous advance upon Norfolk and Richmond, or the cutting off
from all supplies of men or munitions of the first by the occupation
of Suffolk, its conquest of and a subsequent attack upon the rebel
capital."</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> most remarkable character whom the recent turn of events in the United States has brought into the foreground is undoubtedly W. H. Seward. President Lincoln's star waxes pale beside that of the brilliant New Yorker. The American cataclysm, though it has produced no great General able to educe order from the universal wreck of things, has at least brought forth a Minister of Foreign Affairs worthy of the occasion. Earl Russell has recognised in a signal manner the ability of the man with whom he has already broken several lances, and exchanged as many vows of amity by republishing and laying before Parliament the entire congressional public document containing the correspondence between Mr. Seward and the representatives of the Federal Government in all parts of the world. We venture to believe that no candid mind can turn from the perusal of this voluminous correspondence without acknowledging that it is a lasting monument of Mr. Seward's industry and genius. With what a dexterous and happy art he expatiates on the same theme to each Ambassador without once suggesting to the reader the idea of a repetition! How prodigally he scatters gems of political philosophy, quaint apothegms, felicitous appeals to the nobler sentiments of our nature, dashed here and there (but very rarely) with a tinge of resentment and menace! Let us imagine Edmund Burke or William Gladstone at the Foreign Office privileged to disregard the fetters which tradition, routine, and the proprieties and conventionalities of office impose upon our Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and further privileged to open a new account in the national ledger with each foreign nation, dependency, and colony. The position would be analogous to that of Mr. Seward in 1861, and the literary result in the line of essay, disquisition, and rhetoric would probably be far from dissimilar. The American Secretary seems to have thought the official style of British diplomatists and of his immediate predecessors in office too hard and dry to suit his purposes, and to have hit on a medium between that and the florid sententiousness which characterises the choicest effusions of the Chanceries of the Celestial Empire.</p>

<p> The verbose, flimsy, and inconsequential despatch in which Mr. Seward announced his compliance with the British demand for the surrender of Messrs. Mason and Slidell is that by which, unfortunately for his reputation, the American Secretary is best known in England; but this despatch was exceptional in two respects&#x2014;firstly, in that it was the joint production of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet; and, secondly, because it was written, not in perfect freedom, as were the others, but under the terrible constraint which bade him steer clear of the Scylla of a British fleet on the one hand, and the Charybdis of American indignation on the other.</p>

<p>A truer estimate of Mr. Seward's ability as a diplomat may be

gathered by a few specimens culled almost at random from the <sic corr="aforesaid">afore aid</sic> Blue Book. That highly-wrought and
highflown letter of instructions to Mr. Charles Francis Adams contains
an argument against the recognition of the Confederate States, in
which Mr. Seward finds occasion to work in passages like
these:&#x2014;"Great Britain has within the last forty-five years
changed character and purpose. She has become a Power for production
rather than a Power for destruction. She is committed, as it seems to
us, to a policy of industry, not of ambition&#x2014;a policy of peace, not
of war. One has only to compare her present domestic condition with
that of any former period to see that this new career on which she has
entered is as wise as it is humane and beneficent. Her success in this
career requires peace throughout the civilised world, and nowhere so
much as on this Continent. . . .  Humanity has indeed little to hope
for if it shall in this age of high improvement be decided without a
trial that the principle of international law, which regards nations
as moral persons, bound so to act as to do to each other the least
injury and the most good, is merely an abstraction too refined to be
reduced into practice by the enlightened nations of Western
Europe."</p>

<p>In the letter to Mr. Dayton, Minister to France, Mr. Seward thus
quaintly suggests the rationale of the Secession movement:&#x2014;"The
insurrection proves, in fact, nothing else except that eighty years of
peace is as much as human nature has the moderation to endure under
circumstances the most conducive to moderation." The Minister to Spain
is told that, "Unhappily, in the present conditions of society,
nations are, to say the least, neither wiser nor more just or generous
than individual men." With admirable candour he moralises upon Bull
Run to the Minister to Italy. "The lesson that war cannot be waged successfully without wisdom as well as patriotism has been received at a severe cost; but perhaps it was necessary." In the sane vein he acknowledges to Mr. Adams that "It has been necessary for us to learn&#x2014;perhaps the instruction has not come too soon&#x2014;that vicissitudes are incident to our system and our country, as they are to all others." The instructions to the Minister to Russia begin thus:&#x2014;"Nations, like individuals, have three prominent
wants&#x2014;first, freedom; secondly, prosperity; thirdly, friends. The
United States early secured the two first objects by the exercise of
courage and enterprise. But, although they have always practised singular moderation, they nevertheless have been slow in winning friends." Mr. Seward's muse takes an eagle-like flight as it approaches the Alps. He tells the Minister to Switzerland&#x2014;"Human nature must lose not only the faculty of reason which lifts it above the inferior beings, but also the benevolence which lifts it up to commune with superior orders of existence when the security, welfare, and happiness of the United States shall have become even a matter of indifference to Italy or Switzerland. I salute Switzerland last among the European nations, only because we esteem and confide in her most."</p>

<p>Although Mr. Seward has enjoyed a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> high
local reputation for more then a quarter of a century, his name was
known to but a few in England or the Continent two years ago. His
present position is a well-earned guerdon of talents perseveringly
employed and of principles faithfully adhered to. Beginning public
life at an early age, he chose not the dominant and popular Democratic
party, but that of the Opposition which, while it could hold out no
speedy prospect of high office to the young aspirant, yet commanded
the adhesion of a great majority of the best educated and most
substantial citizens cf the Northern States. The Whigs of New York
made him Governor of the State for two terms (1838-42), and in the
regular course of promotion he ought to have been translated to
Washington either as a Federal Senator or at the head of some
executive department under a Whig administration. But at this point
his strong antislavery principles stood in the way of his advancement,
and Whigs of less brilliant talents, but of more orthodox and quietist
opinions on the great question, were preferred before him by party
conventions and caucuses. Finding himself too far in advance of the
average opinions of the New Yorkers, he withdrew from public life for
some years, biding his time, like the English Whigs of a past
generation, and trusting that the day would come when the public
sentiment of his State would develop itself in such a direction as to
admit of his re-entry on a career of public usefulness. It was not
until 1849, when he was nearly fifty years of age, that he appeared in
Washington as Senator from New York. Here also the overshadowing
influence of the slaveowners threw him into the background, and denied
him a share of influence commensurate with his talents and
ambition. The formation of the Republican organization in 1855 at last
gave him a party whose fundamental principles were those with which
his name and fame were most closely identified, and opened to him the
prospect of Executive preferment. Yet even this party, while ever
acknowledging him as their virtual leader, preferred John C. Fremont
as their standard-bearer in 1856, and Abraham Lincoln in 1860, though
on this last occasion the powerful phalanx of Mr. Seward's friends in
the nominating convention literally shed tears at the sacrifice of
feeling they were called upon to make. It was thought that Colonel
Fremont and Mr. Lincoln, as Southerners by birth, and as comparatively
new men, would be less obnoxious to the slaveowning interest than the
lifelong champion of the anti-slavery cause. Cherishing no petty pique
or jealousy, he threw himself with ardour into the canvass in behalf
of his successful competitor, and rendered Mr. Lincoln's election sure
by his eloquent public harangues through the Western
States&#x2014;harangues which exhibited the same wonderful fertility
of resource in the ever-novel treatment of the one great theme to a
score of different audiences, to which his State papers have since
borne additional testimony. Though not destined to occupy the
Republican throne, he was to become, as Mr. Lincoln's Premier, the
power behind the President greater than the President himself. The nation hailed with enthusiasm the elevation of the now sexagenarian statesman to the highest
office in the gift of the Federal Executive and Senate, who thirty
years<pb n="461"/>
previously had been deemed too much of a "fanatic" to be <sic>presentible</sic>
at Washington.</p>

<p>There are other ideas besides that of making freedom national and
slavery sectional to which Mr. Seward has been "fanatically" attached,
and one of these is, happily for both parties concerned, that a war
between "the American and European branch of the British race" would
be a fearful crime on the part of those responsible for its
occurrence. It is clear as noonday, from a scrutiny of his whole
career, that he is anxious that his name shall not be connected in any
dishonourable manner with such a catastrophe to the progress of
mankind.  For three years more he will in all human probability
conduct the foreign policy of the Federal Government. Animated as we
are sure the British Government is by principles not less humane than
those which prevail at Washington, may we not be permitted to see in
this combination of Russell and Seward a guarantee of at least three
years' peace? But who will succeed Mr. Lincoln? Ask those who elected
him, and they will almost unanimously respond, "William Henry Seward."
We would fain hope so; yet either one of two contingencies seems at
least equally probable&#x2014;namely, that some lucky man of the sword will
thrust aside the man of ideas, or that this great tribune of the
people will he sacrificed at the altar of reconciliation by the two
now contending sections, leaving the pride of place to become the prey
of some uncommitted and unscrupulous democratic politician who may
seek to drown the bitter memories of the immediate past in an
anti-British crusade.<hi rend="italic"> Absit

<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Norwegian we
have telegrams to the 26th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The Nashville had returned to Nassau, having been unable to run
the blockade at Charleston. The steamer Cecil, however, and several
small vessels at Nassau, had successfully run the blockade.</p>

<p>The Federals had got ready a third iron-plated steamer, and dispatched her to Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>The city of Apalachicola, in Florida, was captured by two gun-boats on the 3rd ult. A few shells dispersed the Confederates who were in arms there, and the non-resistant portion of the population, consisting chiefly of women and children and "contrabands," were found almost starving. The blockade had effectually cut off all supplies from the seaboard, and their resources from the inland were not sufficient to maintain the ordinary comforts of life.</p>

<p>The Southern journals announce that the Federals commenced the bombardment of Fort Jackson, below New Orleans, on the 23rd ult. One thousand shells had fallen in the fort. The bombardment was continuing at last accounts.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan still sits down before the Confederate
intrenchments at Yorktown. There have been some slight artillery
duels, which have resulted favourably to the Federals. General McDowell
and General Banks, each at the head of a corps-d'arm&#xE9;e, are
advancing upon Richmond from the North. McDowell had occupied
Fredericksburg, without opposition, the municipal authorities,
however, informing him that their submission was an enforced one,
their hearts being with the Confederates. General Banks repeats that
the enemy are evacuating the valley of the Shenandoah and falling back upon Gordonsville.</p>

 <p>The Federal General Mitchell had occupied Juka, a town in the extreme north-eastern portion of the State of Mississippi. His energetic movements in the northern part of this State, Alabama, and Georgia were causing much uneasiness to the Confederates.</p>

<p>General Halleck, in command near Corinth, has not yet made an assault upon Beauregard's position. In the meantime reinforcements were flowing in fast to the Southern General.</p>

<p>Fort Wright, on the Mississippi, seventy-eight miles above Memphis,
is found to be strongly fortified and guarded by fourteen Confederate gun-boats. The Federal General Pope's division had left Fort Wright to reinforce General Halleck near Corinth. The Confederates resorted to the desperate measure of cutting through the lev&#xE9;e on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi, thereby submerging the country for forty miles and preventing the advance of the Federal forces.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CONFEDERATE STATES.</p>

<p>President Davis had sent a message to Congress recommending the

passage of a conscription law, declaring that all men between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five years are rightfully subject to military duty, and should be held to be in the military service of the Confederate States.</p>

<p>M. Mercier, the French Minister, had left Richmond and returned to
Washington. The Danish and Swedish Ministers were, at last accounts, on their way to the Confederate capital.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The policy of making freedom national and slavery sectional is
being pursued with vigour by the Federal
Executive and Legislature. The Senate has ratified the new treaty with
Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade. The Washington
correspondent of the New York<hi rend="italic"> Commercial Advertiser</hi> writes thus of its provisions:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>It is understood to recognise the right of search by naval vessels especially
commissioned for the purpose by either power, within certain limits off the
coasts of Africa and Cuba. Joint British and American Admiralty Courts are
to be established at New York and at Sierra Leone for the examination of
suspected vessels.</p></q>

<p>The Senate has also passed a bill recognising and establishing
diplomatic relations with the Negro States of Hayti and Liberia. The
same body has passed a bill for establishing a line of armed steamers between San Francisco and Shanghai.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had formally avowed the proceeding taken by ex-Secretary Cameron against Mr. Pierce Butler, which proceeding had led to the arrest of Mr. Cameron in Philadelphia.</p>

<p rend="center">THE CENSORSHIP OF THE PRESS.</p>

<p>The New York journals begin to complain bitterly of the censorship
as wielded by Mr. Stanton. The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>
has an editorial article on the subject, which, after detailing the
severity of the surveillance exercised over the war correspondents of
the leading journals and remarking on the keen relish with which
Mr. Stanton enjoyed the sport, concludes in this strain:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>The experiment has been tried. The censorship has had full
swing, and it is in evidence that no movement of the Union Army has
been made of which the rebels were not fully apprised. The knowledge
through the secretary's interference was only withheld from the loyal
people of the North. Proof of the<pb n="465"/>merely gratuitous and
mischievous nature of the censorship could not be more perfect. It has
become to press and people an intolerable grievance, and,
unfortunately, there has been no such realisation of the hopes
entertained upon the coming of Mr. Stanton to office as to warrant him
in trifling further with public endurance. Disappointed in the War
Minister, the people will dispense with his services as agent of secret
police.</p></q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 10, 1862</p>
<p>...General M'CIellan had not taken Yorktown at the last
advices, but had made an apparently weak attack, which had been
attended with no result except the deaths of many brave men. His
position does not appear to be an enviable one. It is stated, however,
that his avowed enemy, Mr. Stanton, had been compelled by the
President to succumb, and that General M'Clellan was to have all the
reinforcements that he required. So far as we can judge, he seems to
have done as we did in the Crimea&#x2014;namely, allowed the enemy to choose
his own ground, and that the very strongest that exists, and there to
fight the great duel. The battle of Pittsburg, which is called by the
South the battle of Shiloh, is no longer claimed as a victory by the
North, and may be regarded as one of the heaviest items to the credit
of the Confederates. We do not perceive much worth setting down in the
rumours and probabilities of encounters, and no movement or action of
importance is recorded. Meantime, the liberating process is slowly,
but it would seem effectually, proceeding; and those in the districts
that are to be dealt with who think their slaves worth more
than &#xA3;60 are said to be moving away with those articles of
commerce. The visit of M. Mercier to Richmond has given rise to much
discussion, and those who know nothing about it affirm with laudable
confidence that the Emperor of the French desires to make peace in
order to the concluding a treaty by which the Americans and the French
shall unite for an attack on England. But the report does not seem to
find much credence, and as a sensation paragraph the statement is voted stupid.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">New Orleans</hi>&#x2014;There is a charm in
the life and society of New Orleans difficult to understand and
impossible to describe. "No place like New Orleans," is the verdict of
all who have lived there long enough to know what it is; and this in
spite of the river that threatens to drown you, and the swamp filled
with mosquitoes and alligators; in spite of the yellow fever every
three years, and months of every year with the thermometer above
ninety degrees. "I had rather be a nigger in New Orleans than own New
York and live there," would not be considered a very extravagant
assertion in the former city. Whatever may be the cause of the
feeling, there is no doubt about the fact. The people are eminently
social, generous, genial, and impulsive. The climate during eight
months of the year is also indescribably delicious. Roses bloom,
bananas ripen, and ripe oranges cover the trees in January. There are
little traits of character which may give the stranger some idea of
the character of the people. The smallest coin in circulation is the
picayune, or five-cent piece. Pennies, or cents, when brought from the
north, are used by the boys for pitch and toss, but are of no use in
making purchases. Ask a market man if his eggs are fresh, and he will
immediately break one to show you, and then throw it into the gutter.&#x2014;<hi rend="italic">Once A Week.</hi></p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamers City of New York and Bohemian we
have news from New York to the 3rd inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>On the 25th ult. the Federal gun-boats passed Forts Jackson and
St. Philip, leaving those forts in the possession of the enemy, and
proceeded up the Mississippi towards New Orleans. Immediately the
citizens heard this news they destroyed all the cotton and
steam-boats, except such as were necessary to transport coin,
ammunition, &amp;c. Of coin it is said the Confederates carried
away 18,000,000 dollars. On, Saturday, the 26th ult., the Federal
Commander Farragut demanded of the Mayor of New Orleans an unqualified
surrender of the city. He likewise demanded that the Federal flag
should be hoisted on all public buildings and all Confederate flags
removed. He requested the Mayor to use his authority to quell any disturbance, and concluded by saying:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>I shall severely punish any persons committing such outrages as were witnessed yesterday by armed men firing upon helpless women and children forgiving expression to their pleasure at witnessing the old flag.</p></q>

<p>The Mayor replied that, for the sake of the women and children, General Lovell had evacuated the city, leaving the administration of affairs to the civil authorities:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>To surrender an undefended city (he continued) would be an
unmeaning ceremony. The city is yours by power of brutal force, not by
the choice or consent of the inhabitants. It is for you to determine
the fate that awaits us here. There is no man in our midst whose hand
or head would not be paralysed at hoisting a flag not of our own
adoption. You may trust in the honour of the inhabitants, though you
might not count on their submission to unmerited wrong. Your occupancy
of the city does not transfer the allegiance of the inhabitants from
the Government of their choice to one which they have deliberately
repudiated. They yield the obedience which the conqueror is entitled
to exact from the conquered.</p></q>

 <p>A battalion of Federal marines had occupied the city. General
Butler's forces had landed on the shore of Lake Pontchartrain and
were within a few miles of the city. The Confederate General Lovell
fell back to Camp Moore, on the Jackson railroad, seventy-five miles
distant from New Orleans, on the road to Memphis, to effect a junction with General Beauregard, who is said to have evacuated Corinth.</p>

<p>The Federals have since occupied Baton Rouge, the capital of

Louisiana. It is situated on the left bank of the river, about 120 miles above New Orleans.</p>

<p>A great battle is said to be imminent at Grand Junction, near Memphis, between Generals Halleck and Beauregard. Both have been largely reinforced. General Halleck's army is estimated at 160,00 men. The Federal Government has forbidden the transmission of telegrams from Pittsburg Landing.</p>

<p>Intelligence has been received from General Burnside operating in
North Carolina. Fort Macon surrendered to him on the 25th ult. The
garrison retired with the honours of war. The Federal loss was seven
killed and eighteen wounded. This opens Beaufort to the Federals, and leaves to the Confederates in North Carolina only the

port of Wilmington.</p>

<p>Before Yorktown nothing decisive had occurred. A company of

a Massachusetts regiment had captured an advanced lunette near

the head of the Warwick, with the loss of sixteen men. On the 26th

ult. General M'Clellan telegraphed, "In spite of the rain, our work

progresses well."</p>

<p>General Banks's advance has been checked by the destruction of the bridges across the Shenandoah. General M'Dowell has made no further movement.</p>

<p>The French Minister, M. Henri Mercier, after his return to Washington, visited the State Department, and had a long interview with Secretary Seward. The Swedish and Danish Ministers had returned to Washington without proceeding to Richmond. The Secretary of the Spanish Legation had left Fortress Monroe under a flag of truce for the South.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had visited the French frigate Gassendi at Washington Navy-yard. The French Minister received Mr. Lincoln on
board. The yards of the vessel were manned and a national salute fired on the President's arrival and departure.</p>

<p>Congress had adopted a vote of censure on ex-Secretary Cameron of the War Department for adopting, with regard to army contracts, a policy highly injurious to the public. A similar vote with regard to the conduct of Secretary Welles of the Navy had been negatived.</p>
<p>The Senate has confirmed the appointment of Charles Lathrop as

Collector of Customs at New Orleans.</p>

<p>A Congressional Committee had issued a report that the Confederates
committed inhuman atrocities upon the Federal dead and wounded
after the battle of Bull Run.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives had passed resolutions empowering
the Secretary of the Treasury to prevent the shipment of goods to
foreign ports, whence they are reshipped to Confederate parts.</p>

<p>The House Committee of Ways and Means had reported an appropriation
amounting to 226,000,000 dols., for the support of the army during the year ending June 30, 1863.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The Hon. Edward Everett has made an appeal to the public in behalf
of Lieutenant Worden, of the Monitor, whose sight, he says, has been
seriously injured, and health greatly, if not permanently,
impaired. Lieutenant Worden has a wife and children dependent on him for support.</p>

<p>The New York papers publish the text of the "Seward-Lyons"
treaty for the suppression of the slave trade. It consists of twelve
articles. Having very little authentic home or war news to lay before
their readers, the journalists give free rein to the imagination of their Washington correspondents, who have concocted several "sensation" canards relating to French mediation and intervention, and the withdrawal of the Opposition members of Congress in a body, as a protest against the antislavery policy of the Administration.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 17.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Crescent City has fallen. We are
almost without details, but of the fact there would appear to be no
reasonable doubt. The vaunted defences of
New Orleans, which were described as capable of resisting ten times
the power which the Federals had sent against them, have been passed,
rather than forced, by some gun-boats, and the city was at the mercy
of its assailants. The armed defenders made good their retreat,
carrying with them their treasure, but leaving, it is said, much
valuable stores. Both in a moral and a military point of view the blow
is a terrible one for the South, and may materially injure the chances
of General Beauregard. The Confederates are now menaced in so many
quarters, and with force which, properly handled, should be
overwhelming, that a brilliant victory, giving nothing more than
victory, would be of small avail in the great game. Their prospects
darken every day. Yorktown, however, holds out against General
M'Clellan, and it may be that at Corinth the able leader of the South
has inflicted another blow. It is pointed out that a dash may be made
by the Confederate vessels on the Mississippi, and that the gun-boats
that have taken New Orleans may be destroyed; but there has been so
little evidence of dash on the part of any of the Southern commanders
that we scarcely look for such news. Communication is being gradually
but effectively cut off; and should Yorktown fall, or the army on the
Rappahannock operate successfully, the time would seem to have come
when mediation may be accepted without loss of honour. In the mean
time a more pleasant incident than aught connected with war is the
signature of a treaty between ourselves and the North (will the South
hold itself bound thereby, and might not a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi> arise thereout?) for the more effectual putting down the slave trade. The right of search is conceded to England, and the denial of this right has hitherto been the safeguard of the "merchant fraught with

cargoes of despair."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Slave Trade</hi>.&#x2014;In answer to several
questions from Mr. Buxton, Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Layard</hi> said
that a vessel under American colours had been at Liverpool which was
ascertained to be a slaver. During the time the vessel was at
Liverpool no suspicion was entertained about it. It was only after it
had left that it was ascertained to be a slaver; but, through
information which was transmitted by the Government to the African
coast, a full cargo was seized, about five hundred slaves. He
regretted to say that a considerable slave trade had sprung up between
the Portuguese settlements and the island of St. Thomas, and it was
said that they were freetraders. Her Majesty's Government had strong
reason to suppose that they were slavers, and they had made strong
representations to the Portuguese Government, and he trusted the King
would take measures for putting a stop to it. As to the slave trade in
Cuba, he was sorry to say that Spain was carrying on that detestable
trade. He hoped that the Spanish Government was not aware of it, and
her Majesty's Government had sent representations on the subject. As
to the slave trade on the east coast of Africa, he had to say that
Lord Cowley had instructions to make representations to the French
Government. Inquiries had been instituted, but on account of the great
distance no answer had been received up to the present
time.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">CAPTAIN WILSON, OF THE EMILY ST. PIERRE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> announced in a recent Number the
capture and recapture of the British merchant-ship Emily St. Pierre,
and we have much pleasure in now giving a Portrait of the chief hero,
Captain Wilson, in this act of daring gallantry. The Emily St. Pierre
was, it will be remembered, captured off the Charleston coast, in
March last, by the Federal man-of-war James Adger; a prize crew of two
officers and thirteen men were put on board the vessel, and the
merchant crew, with the exception of the captain (Wilson) and three
men, who were left on board, were trans-shipped to the James
Adger. The Emily St. Pierre was ordered to Philadelphia; but on the
way Captain Wilson succeeded, by means already well known, in
recapturing his vessel and taking her to Liverpool, with the prize
crew on board as prisoners. This daring and skilful act gained him
much approbation, and, to mark their sense of his conduct, the
merchants of Liverpool, to the number of 170, raised a subscription, and
on Saturday Captain Wilson was presented with a magnificent service of
plate. The presentation took place at the offices of the Mercantile
Marine Association. Mr. James Beazley presided, and many of the
principal merchants of Liverpool were present. Mr. Beazley, in making
the presentation, stated that the conduct of Captain Wilson had not
only met with the admiration of gentlemen partial to the cause of the
South but also of those who held with the policy of the Northern
States of America. Her Majesty's Navy, too, had marked its esteem of
Captain Wilson's behaviour, as among those who had subscribed was
Captain Inglefield, of her Majesty's ship Majestic, now anchored in
the Mersey; while both the members of Parliament for Liverpool had
also contributed towards the presentation. In addition to the service
of plate was a gold chronometer watch and appendages and a splendid
sextant, the latter article being presented by Captain Wilson's own
crew, who have since arrived in Liverpool from America. Mr. Beazley
stated that the owner of the Emily St. Pierre had presented Captain
Wilson with the sum of &#xA3;2000, and intended also to provide
handsomely for the cook and steward of the vessel, without whom
Captain Wilson could never have succeeded. The council of the
Mercantile Marine Association have determined to present a special
gold medal to the captain and silver ones each to the cook and
steward. After the presentation to Captain Wilson two purses, each
containing 20 guineas, were handed to the cook and steward.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson is in his forty-seventh year.
He is the son of a Scottish farmer, and was born at Colvend, near
Dumfries. In his fourteenth year he went to sea, being apprenticed to
the North American trade. Previous to taking the command of the Emily
St. Pierre he had commanded the vessels Grampian, Cheviot, Huron, and
Alice Wilson. The captain is, as might have been expected from so
brave a man, very unassuming, and his manner and quiet way of
recounting his story to his Liverpool audience on Saturday week have
added much to the admiration which his deeds have excited. As regards
Captain Wilson's two coadjutors, hardly less brave than himself, the
steward, an Englishman, is of small stature, and is about twenty-eight
years old; the cook is a German, of middle  size, in his twenty-seventh
year.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE FRENCH IN MEXICO.</p>
<p> <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> European intervention in the affairs
of the Mexican Republic has entered upon a new phase. Great Britain
and Spain have simultaneously retired from the enterprise of restoring
order in that distracted country, leaving to the French Government the
sole honour, responsibility, and expense of carrying out its own more
comprehensive and thoroughgoing plans. In this we see little to
regret. The share of the British Government in the joint expedition
was from the first on such a modest scale as to suggest the idea that
their participation in the alliance was nominal and formal, and
designed with the object of giving them a vote in the common councils
which might be needed to counterbalance the supposed projects of Spain,
rather than with a view to efficient operations against the dominant
faction in Mexico, which dignifies itself with the style and title of
the Government. At the outset there was some reason to fear that the
Spanish Government and people were indulging themselves in dreams of
reconquest and a revival of the ideas of Hernando Cortes. If ever
entertained, they have vanished before the hard realities of
international policy. The aversion with which the descendants of the
revolted colonists regarded the flag of the "mother country" planted
anew upon their soil&#x2014;an aversion which they were politely careful to
distinguish from the much milder sentiment of chagrin with which they
viewed the presence of the French and British troops&#x2014;proved that
Spain was not fitted to be the instrument for inflicting a measured
and mitigated chastisement which has for its aim not the ruin and
permanent subjugation but the reformation of the culprit. The
withdrawal of Spain removes from the expedition its ugliest feature,
while the retirement of Great Britain relieves our embarrassed
finances from what might become a heavy strain and the Chancellor of
the Exchequer of one at least of his large budget of cares.</p>
<p>Thus France stands forward in a character highly gratifying to her
great self-love, as the representative and agent of European
civilisation for the subjugation of a semi-barbarous community and the
regeneration of a beautiful country. She aspires to re-enact in Mexico
the r&#xF4;le she recently abandoned with reluctance in Syria. In
the Syrian affair she was the fully recognised and duly authorised
agent of Europe; in Mexico the agency is not the less real because it
is tacitly conferred and accepted, and results from an "understanding"
instead of a formal convention. Fortunately, John Bull is not now in
one of his periodical invasion panics. The 1500 pairs of long boots so
kindly furnished by the French Government for the use of the Canadian
garrison trampled out the last scintilla of "the third panic." Had it
been otherwise the present phase of the Mexican difficulty might have
furnished the occasion to party politicians and "sensation"
journalists for getting up a Gallophobic cry. The wise and generous
conduct of the French Government in our late difficulty with the
United States now stands it in good stead, and enables its acts and
intentions to be viewed with impartiality and freedom from the
distorting mist of prejudice which is too apt to cloud the perceptions
of a large portion of the English people. Now is the time to reiterate
the assertion that British and French interests on the American
continent are absolutely indentical, that for the past twenty years
the two nations have pursued a common policy on every American
question, and that their accord offers the best and probably the only
adequate guarantee for the protection of European interests whenever
they may happen to come in conflict with the purely selfish and often
Anti-European policy of the leading Power of the New World. There are
none who will view the planting of the<pb n="520"/> French flag in the
plaza of the city of Mexico with so much pleasure as the European
merchants, of whatever nation, who lead a precarious and timorous
existence there.</p>

<p>The American Secretary of State has not left the world in darkness
as to the light in which he views this intervention of Europe on the
shores of the Gulf. Though never, it must be confessed, one of the
blatant champions of that doctrine of American exclusiveness which is
unfairly fathered upon Mr. Monroe, he has in the present instance
shown himself actuated by the sentiment which underlies it. We cannot,
indeed, blame him for opposing with all his usual force the rumoured
project of forcing an Austrian Prince upon the <hi rend="italic">unwilling</hi> Mexicans&#x2014;a, course which, he truly says,
"would be the beginning rather than the ending of the revolution in
Mexico," and which makes even the Spanish General cry out, "What
madness !" Neither, on the other hand, is there any sufficient
ground for doubting the sincerity of the disavowal of such design
given by the French Government. However unfriendly the Emperor of the
French may be to republics in the abstract, and however willing to
identify the cause of order with that of monarchy, provided the
Mexicans are an assenting party (which they will assuredly not be),
there is nothing in his character and past career to lead us to
suppose he would be likely to engage in the quixotic enterprise of
restoring, <hi rend="italic">&#xE0; tout prix</hi>, the fallen fortunes
of monarchy in the New World, whose political soil seems eminently
unfriendly to the growth of that institution. At any rate, it will
devolve upon the American Government, not on ours, to protect the
Republican cause in the New World and thwart the designs of the
partisans of General Almonte and the Archduke Maximilian. Had
Mr. Seward confined himself to a protest against a scheme of this kind
he would not have encountered the defeat which his diplomacy in this
affair has already suffered both at home and abroad. While keenly
susceptible to the slight wound inflicted on American vanity by the
presence on Mexican soil of a European armed force, he was as
indifferent as any old-school professor of the ethics of statecraft to
the serious wrongs to which Europe had long tamely submitted. Taking
no thought of the oft-repeated cry of "Death to foreigners!" and its
tragic results to the lives of unoffendiug families, nor of the
national flags repeatedly dishonoured, Mr. Seward obstinately refused
to see that any questions were involved beyond those of pecuniary
compensation and punctual payment of the national debt. In accordance
with this idea, he hit upon the expedient of offering to the three
Powers a United States' guarantee of the solvency of Mexico for ten
years, in return for which they were to remove their fleets and pay
involuntary homage to the "Monroe doctrine." In November Lord Lyons
wrote from Washington that Mr. Seward was very unwilling to believe that
the European Powers would reject his offer.</p>

<p>In further prosecution of this happy conception he instructed
Mr. Cerwin, the American Minister to Mexico, to negotiate a treaty of
this nature with the Government of Juarez, but the United States'
Senate, putting a truer construction on the motives which actuated the
European Powers, or considering that the present was not the time to
undertake new and complicated financial engagements, rejected the
treaty with a promptness and unanimity which was the reverse of
flattering to Mr. Seward's statesmanship.</p>

<p>Another result of this new complication is to bring the policy of
the United States and France into more definite opposition to each
other. So long as Great Britain was connected with the undertaking the
lion's share of the odium attaching thereto in the eyes of the
Americans would have been allotted to us, but now all British
responsibility ceases. It will be edifying to observe with what oily
professions of goodwill and resignation the American Secretary of
State, Congress, journalists, and people will watch the progress of
French arms in Mexico. Whatever the outward expressions may be, we may
rely upon it that there will be distrust and apprehension within,
which will not be the less painful because more than usually well
concealed. The apprehension thus aroused will not be without its good
use. It will act on the American mind as a counter-irritant to the
feeling of resentment towards England now unhappily so rife there. The
American Government has, moreover, a rod in pickle for Spain
respecting the recent reannexation to the Spanish crown of the quondam
Republic of San Domingo. Time was when the untrammelled and abstinent
foreign policy of the Government of Washington made the office of
Secretary of State almost a sinecure whose thief attraction was the
opportunity it afforded for writing a long, showy, and spirited despatch
to some European Government or other once or twice in the
course of four years; but times are changed for the worse in this respect, and even the active and versatile genius of Mr. Seward groans under the pressure put upon his department.</p>

<p>Finally, will the French Government succeed in the main and
legitimate object of its policy&#x2014;the restoration of a strong and
settled Government to Mexico? There are always plenty of cynics and
pessimists in the world ready to prophesy evil of any enterprise,
especially when it is conducted by a nation to which our historical
traditions are opposed. We are inclined to take a more hopeful
view. The Emperor of the French can better afford to spend several
hundred million francs than be the originator of an abortive and
ridiculous expedition.  Mexican anarchy is to a great extent an
artificial product raised in the hotbed of the protection thrown
around it by the Government of the United States in pre-revolutionary
times.  That protection being now at an end, there is a fair prospect
that affairs will mend after Europe has reasserted her claims to
respect and "redressed the balance" of the New World. At all events,
the experiment is worth trying; and whether it be conducted by one
European Power, or by a combination of three, is a matter of secondary
concern. If the experiment succeeds, the result will accrue to the
benefit of every commercial nation, and the French will be able to
realise that sense of serene pleasure which the expenditure of one's
private resources on behalf of the general good imparts to every
chivalrous mind. In respect to France herself, the occupation of
Mexico will serve the same purpose as the occupation of Syria. It will
afford an outlet to those feverish energies of the French people which
find themselves "cribbed, cabined, and confined" within the narrow
limits of their native land, and, by so doing, will help to prolong
that era of general peace in Europe in which it is our privilege to
live, and the continuance of which is so indispensable to the
happiness and prosperity, not only of the people of these isles, but
of all mankind.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS</hi>.<lb/>AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the North American and the City of Washington we
have news from New York to the l0th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS BY SEA AND LAND.</p>

<p>The events on the York and James River peninsula have been of the highest significance. On the 30th ult. President Davis and other Confederate leaders arrived at Yorktown, and after a consultation with the leading Generals all agreed that Yorktown was untenable and should be evacuated. General Magruder alone was of opinion that it was not advisable to evacuate the position. General J. Johnston issued the order for the evacuation on the 1st inst. It was commenced on the 2nd and completed on the night of the 3rd. The Confederates left a large amount of guns and camp equippage which they could not remove for fear of being seen.</p>

<p>As soon as the evacuation of Yorktown was known, the troops under the command of General M'Clellan were put in motion to pursue the Confederates. On the 4th, two miles from Williamsburg, they came up with the Confederates' rearguard, which was found to be strong. The Federals being in want of infantry and, night coming on, the pursuit was postponed till the morning of the 5th.</p>

<p>The Federal gun-boats proceeded up York River simultaneously with the land forces.</p>

<p>On the 5th an engagement took place at Williamsburg, which resulted
in the further retreat of the Confederates, and the occupation of the
position by the Federals. At nine p.m. General M'Clellan and escort
entered the town and took possession. About 150 of the Confederates'
wounded were left behind without any rations, medicines, or
surgeons. All the wounded prisoners taken by the Confederates were
also abandoned. Including the wounded, the Federals took in the
engagement about 1000 prisoners. General M'Clellan reports that the
brilliant bayonet charge of General Hancock decided the fate of the
day. The Federals lost about 300 killed and 700 wounded. Nearly 700 of
the Confederate dead were left on the field. A large number of guns,
ammunition and a considerable store of provisions were found
in the town, and the road was strewn for many miles with arms.</p>

<p>After the evacuation of Williamsburg the Federal forces pursued the
Confederates eight miles beyond, as far as the Chickahominy River. The
Confederates, retreating across the Chickahominy, destroyed all the
bridges. The main body had at last accounts retreated to the south
bank of the James River. The Federal forces rested on the left bank of
this river. General M'Clellan finds great difficulty in getting up food, on account of the state of the roads. The Confederates in front of him are in a worse condition, many of the captured not having tasted anything but biscuit for forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>The Federal iron-clad steamer Galena, with two gun-boats, had started up the James River to cut off the river communication of
the Confederates with Richmond. This expedition seems to have miscarried, as, on the 9th, General M'Clellan reports that the Galena was
aground in James River, a little above Yorktown.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand Federal troops, under General Franklin, had been
landed at West Point, at the head of York River, and twenty miles above Williamsburg. An engagement had occurred at West Point between this division and the Confederates under General Lee. The latter were shelled by the gun-boats and retreated. It was hoped that this body would intercept the retreat of the Confederate army; but the retreat of the main body across the James River had frustrated this scheme, and General Franklin's troops had effected a junction with M'Clellan's.</p>

<p>Norfolk had not yet been evacuated. Reconnaissances of Federal iron-clad boats to Sewall's Point have established the fact that very few guns and men remained there. The Merrimac and Monitor approached each other several times, but no battle ensued. The Federal steamers returned to Fort Monroe.</p>

<p>General M'Dowell had made no onward movement, and General
Banks was still at Newmarket, in the valley of the Shenandoah,
waiting for forage and provisions.</p>

<p>Advices from General Burnside's command in North Carolina report that large numbers of men had taken the oath of allegiance, and that a loyal regiment of North Carolinians had been organised.</p>

<p>Nothing decisive is reported from the armies of Generals Halleck and
Beauregard.</p>

<p>Federal accounts from New Orleans state that the bombardment of the
forts below that city lasted six days without intermission. Twenty-one
mortar and three gun boats conducted the attack. On the 23rd ult.
they succeeded in silencing the fortifications, and in securing the
safe passage of the river of fourteen war-steamers, among which was
the flag-ship. A severe naval engagement ensued, in which eleven
Confederate gun-boats were destroyed. The Union gun-boat Verona and
the Confederate steamer Webster mutually destroyed each other. General
Butler landed 4000 men above the forts, and on the 24th the forts were
surrendered unconditionally. Captain Bailey officially reports that
the whole of the Confederate navy at New Orleans has been
destroyed. The loss of the Federals was thirty killed and one hundred
wounded; that of the Confederates much greater. The way is now clear
from the Gulf to B&#xE2;ton Rouge, and the Federal fleet are moving
on to Natchez and Memphis.</p>

<p>The Confederates have destroyed cotton and shipping to the amount
of 10,000,000 dols. to prevent it falling into the hands of the victors.
At Memphis sugar and molasses in large quantities were on the bluff ready to be rolled into the river, and all cotton was to be burnt. The planters whose estates lie on the tributaries to the Mississippi have also set the torch to their stores. It is said only one planter objected to take this course.</p>

<p>Postal communication by water between New York and New
Orleans has been re-established. The Union citizens of the latter place
have held a meeting at which enthusiastic demonstrations took place.</p>
<p>The steam-ship Bermuda, and other British ships, laden with arms,
ammunition, and stores, had been captured by the Federal fleet, the
former when bound for and about to enter the British port of Nassau,
New Providence. The steamer Nashville successfully ran the blockade
off Wilmington with a cargo of gunpowder and army stores. She passed
through the fleet of seven vessels, all of which threw shells at her
without inflicting any damage.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>The proceedings of Congress have been unimportant. The French
Minister arrived at Yorktown on the 4th inst. On the 7th President
Lincoln was at Fortress Monroe and Newport News, and had a distant
view of the Merrimac.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward has instructed Mr. Adams to demand of the British Government the restitution of the recaptured prize, Emily St. Pierre, lately brought into Liverpool.</p>

<p>In consequence of the decisive successes of the Federal forces, all
Government, railway, bank, and insurance stocks have risen rapidly in

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 24, 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Beyond</hi> confirmation of all the
intelligence which we published last week touching the successes of
the North, there is not, while we write, much addition to the amount
of American news. It is stated that the bombardment of the New Orleans
forts had been severe and protracted; but the very small number of the
killed and wounded comes, as usual, in ludicrous contrast to the story
of the <hi rend="italic">feu d'enfer</hi> that lasted six
days. General M'Clellan had given evidence of higher strategical
powers than those which help the American press to sensation headings
of paragraphs; and the tactics which drove a strongly-posted enemy to
inglorious retreat from behind fortifications that could have
resisted<pb n="525"/>
the attack of almost any army that could be brought against them will
surely be more admired by real soldiers than any enormous bombardments
which a sergeant of artillery would conduct. But such is not the view
of the case in the North, and M'Clellan is now abused for having
permitted the enemy to be frightened. He would appear to be following
them up, and also to be directing operations likely to hem them
in. The fall of Richmond was anticipated, with more reason than has
gone to the concoction of most of the military prophecies. Unless
Beauregard have adopted the system pursued at Yorktown, it is most
probable that he and Halleck have met in a battle which promises ample
horrors for the vulgar sensation-mongers. The idea that French and
Russian mediation is at hand was still prevalent, and the organs of
public opinion, knowing neither the facts nor the intentions of the
Government, prudently write for and against such interposition, and,
for the greater convenience of readers, include both lines of argument
in the same article.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Postage Stamps.</hi>-We have before our eyes,
says the <hi rend="italic">Si&#xE8;cle</hi>,
an example of the rapidity with which an invention is propagated as
soon as its utility is recognised. The postage-stamp had its origin in
London on the 10th of January, 1840, and for ten years England alone
made use of it. France adopted it on the 1st of January, 1849; the
Tour-and-Taxis office introduced it into Germany in the year 1850, and
it is now in use in sixty-nine countries in Europe, nine in Africa,
five in Asia, thirty-six in America, and ten in Oceania. About fifty
postage-stamps may be counted in the United States alone. Van Diemen's
Land possesses its own; also Hayti, Natal, Honolulu, and
Liberia. Lastly, postage-stamp collectors are so numerous a class as
to possess a manual and special correspondents ; and the prices of
collections at sales are regularly quoted.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">A RUN BY RAIL FROM WASHINGTON TO ST. LOUIS.<lb/><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and Correspondent.)</hi></p>

<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">St. Louis, Missouri,</hi> April 24.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">My</hi> last letter, or rather statement,
which explained the peculiarity of my position on the Potomac, having,
as it were, been mustered out of the service by a special order from
the War Department, also acquainted you with my intention "to couch a
pencil" in the ranks of the army in the Far West. There, in all
conscience, I should <sic>nd</sic> field enough for the exercise of my
profession&#x2014;where battles, not petty skirmishes of advanced <sic corr="posts">pos s</sic>, but good, honest, sledge-hammer fights with
wholesome bills of mortality, were the order of the day, and, forming
myself into a "pen and and pencil brigade," with my feuille de route
in my pocket in the shape of a railway ticket, I "skeedadled" from the
capital of the dis-United States. Oh! how many times since starting
have I bemoaned the extent of this "Almighty big country"!</p>
<p>Those who know the low-backed seats of the American cars will readily sympathise with me in my three days and three nights of railroad travelling. But, after all, that's nothing, bless you! Why, in times of peace, if you want to go from Portland, in Maine, to New
Orleans, you have the privilege of hissing and screaming along at the
rate of thirty miles an hour for over a week. Oh, then, perhaps
some one will say, "Why didn't you take a sleeping&#xB7;car?" Well, I
 didn't because I object to be packed away on a narrow ledge with
 fifty or so perspiring individuals redolent of travel-soiled
 garments, the stale odour of masticating and fumigating tobacco, and
 most of them objecting to the opening of the ventilators. Now, I am
 not by any means one of those who are continually elevating their
 proboscis at the notion of a foreign substance getting between the
 wind and their nobility; but I confess I should prefer travelling in
 a cleanly and Christianlike manner, as a decent individual ought on
 payment of a reasonable sum, instead of being herded into a caravan
 with a set of men who comport themselves more like wild beasts than
 human beings. I do not, in writing thus, intend to offend the great
 American people; but there are occasions on which they show such a
 passionate love for a certain goddess that, as Mark Tapley observes,
 it leads to taking liberties with her. At Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
 we had to change carriages and wait some time for the train that was
 to take us on to <sic corr="Pittsburgh">Pittsburg</sic>. A gentleman
 in one of the Government offices had asked me on leaving Washington
 to take under my protection his brother's wife going to join her
 husband, a naval officer, at Cairo. To this I cheerfully assented;
 our route was the same, and the extent of the attentions required of
 me were scarcely more than what any gentleman would offer to a lady
 travelling unescorted. And very
 necessary, indeed, were these attentions to her, as it so happened,
 even in a country where it is proudly stated no woman need fear
 insult when journeying alone. But to return to our muttons. At
 Harrisburg we found waiting in the station the "hardest crowd" it has
 been my fortune to meet with in the States&#x2014;the real, genuine rowdy
 article which I had often heard of but had really never seen. There
 were a hundred or so of Susquehanna raftsmen, grouped about in the
 ticket office, in every, conceivable position, and dressed in all
 kinds of inconceivable fashions, the
 favourite style appearing to be a slouched hat, rough flannel
 shirt of gorgeous pattern, and bedtick trousers, tucked into high
 boots. None of these gentlemen were remarkable for cleanliness,
 preferring to lounge at length on the quid-becushioned floor, and all
 busily employed masticating and expectorating to such an extent that
 the boards appeared to be literally covered with penny pieces. All
 about their neighbourhood lay the result of their previous labours in
 the shape of what looked marvellously like any quantity of <sic>Liliputian</sic>
 ship swabs. Placing my charge in the ladies' waiting-room, I lit a
 cigar and strolled about on the platform, watching for the advent of
 the <sic>Pittsburg</sic> train, which eventually heralded its approach far away
 in the dark night with a bellow from its steam "cow" that startled
 the echoes from every surrounding hill. On it came&#x2014;huge, undefinable,
 a black mass&#x2014;with a great glare of fire in front. In another moment
 it forged slowly past me, tolling as it were a death knell from the
 engine-bell and associating in my mind spectral tableaux of horrible
 collisions and mangled dead. But a noisy rush of the raftsmen soon
 brought me back to the realities of my position, and hastening to my
 companion we made an effort to reach the ladies' car. Vainly I
 exerted all my strength; it was insufficient to protect her from the
 brutal crowding of the ruffianly crew; they swayed and surged,
 expectorated and blasphemed utterly regardless of my expostulations
 and appeals to them on her behalf. At last I caught the conductor's
 eye, and pointing to my charge made another desperate effort to reach
 the steps on which he stood. After a liberal amount of elbowing on my
 part, and a stubborn resistance on his, of the assailants who wished
 to take forcible possession of that one particular car, I succeeded
 in passing my companion to him, and <sic>springly</sic> quickly after her placed
 her in the only vacant seat that remained, taking my stand by its
 side. "All aboard!" cried the conductor, <sic>below</sic> went the "cow," and
 away we sped. Your readers are most of them, no doubt, familiar with
 the peculiar arrangements of an American railway-train. All the
 carriages communicate by a door at each end, and if a traveller is so
 disposed he may vary the monotony of the journey by moving from one extremity of the train to the other.
Foiled in their first effort to obtain ingress into the ladies' car
(somewhat more comfortable than the others), and finding but room
elsewhere, the raftsmen now came trooping to make a second
attempt. The conductor expostulated and stood in the doorway, but the
pressure soon displaced him. Two gentlemen and myself stood somewhat
further on in the passage way, determined to hold our own to the last;
but fortunately those who obtained admission did not come beyond the
vacant space round the stove. Content, apparently, with having
penetrated so far, they commenced a system of annoyance, unmanly and
unworthy of men of whatever condition they might be. "S-a-a-a-y, Oby!
Guess, we could find good fixins among they gals." Here followed a
coarse laugh and anything but harmonious concert, all joining in the
chorus of
<q><lg><l>Rake her down, Sal,</l>
<l>Foot it to the banjo,</l>
<l>Rang a dang a dang a dang,</l>
<l>Keep the game alive, oh!</l></lg></q>

"Oh, Saul! Cal'c'late they don't like our crowd; guess, they'd better
varmoose; 'taint perlite to keep gentlemen standing," to which suggestion Saul expressed his unqualified approval; had it been qualified somewhat, it would hardly have been so offensive to ladies' ears. Another grand chorus&#x2014;
<q><lg>
<l>Oh, we'll ride upon a railroad, railroad, railroad,</l>
<l>Oh, we'll ride upon a railroad</l>
<l>Bound upon a spree !</l></lg></q>

"S-a-a-a-y, Mister! reckon you've got a standing ticket" (spit): this was addressed to me. "Guess, you travel on an elevated principle"
(spit). It is impossible for me to describe the deliberate drawling manner in which this was said, or the exquisitely juicy fashion in which the observation was punctuated. For hours this kind of thing was kept up, and numerous were the remarks made and songs sung that were totally unfit for a woman to listen to. But what could we do? We in our minority were entirely at the mercy of the mobocracy, and all that the two or three gentlemen present with thyself could hope for was to protect the ladies from more positive insult. Luckily, this ruffianly crew were going no further than Tyrone, and I am sure there was not one among us who did not wearily count the miles till we thankfully left them at their destination. Now, this kind of thing does not happen every day, perhaps; but still, equality travelling continually exposes quiet, respectable people to similar annoyances, and I am sure, from what I have heard, there are hundreds of Americans who would delight to see the system changed.</p>

<p>At daylight we were puffing up the <hi rend="italic">&#xE9;chelles</hi> of the <sic>Alleghany</sic>
Mountains winding round the ledges on the face of the rock in a most
intricate and remarkable manner. Below, on the off side, we could look
down on the pine woods, dwarfed by the height we had obtained, while
now and then an opening in the mountains would display to us the
lovely valley through which we had come, and whose beauties had been
lost in the hours of darkness. There sped the Susquehanna, lightly
draped in a mantle of mist, which was gradually disappearing in
wreathy, rose-tinted columns, as the sun shone out from above the
hills. Jotted about the banks and on the rising ground were the
substantial homesteads of the German farmers, and far, far beyond
stretched dark green forests, so dark that they became almost black in
the fleeting veil of night. Another abrupt turn, and the scene was
changed; we were entering a gorge, and frowning masses of granite
threatened to crush us as we thundered along beneath them. Now<pb n="541"/> we were in the wildest portion of Pennsylvania. Rocky
pinnacles rose on every side, partially clothed in a rough garment of
pine. Turbulent watercourses hissed and boiled in their beds as though
they writhed and rebelled against our intrusion to these
solitudes. For miles the mountainous character of the landscape
remained unchanged; and when at last we emerged from its portals of
granite we found ourselves rolling into the busy, smoky,
anvil-clanging, chimney-spired town of <sic>Pittsburg</sic>, the forge
of the United States. Here we had thirty minutes allowed us for dinner
before taking a fresh track through Ohio and Indiana, and, hungry and
exhausted, we rushed from the cars, anxious to secure something before
all should have disappeared, for eating in America is done on the
high-pressure system, especially at the railway restaurants. But, ah,
confusion! two rival niggers sprang towards me as I alighted on the
platform, each manipulating a gong with might and main. "Step dis way,
boss; elegant dinner for fifty cents. Clar de track, you black nigger
(to his rival), and let de gembleman fetch young missus along."
Regardless of my<hi rend="italic"> coloured brethren</hi>, whom I left
hurling their stage thunder at each other, I forced my way through the
ravenous crowd, dragging after me my companion, and, securing two
chairs, we brought two additional knives and forks to bear upon the
already fast-disappearing viands. I have now been in America some
time, but as yet I am no match for my Transatlantic friends at the
dinner-table: the celerity with which they ship their supplies is
incredible, and their bill of lading is assorted. There went the bell,
and I had scarcely decided yet what I would take, though but little
remained but a few battered remnants of each dish, and, like Lazarus,
I was compelled to satisfy myself with the crumbs from the table.</p>

<p>Our journey now lay through a most beautiful and highly-cultivated
district of Ohio. On each side of the line were rich parterres of
spring wheat, with just the necessary amount of uncleared land to give
character to the country. To the left runs the swollen Ohio River,
with stern-wheel steamers snorting impatiently at their almost
unsuccessful efforts to stem the rapid current. Little smiling
villages and townships burst upon us like sparkling opals from the
emerald woods, and everything denoted a prosperous and
well-conditioned State. As we advanced into the more unsettled
districts we found ourselves surrounded by dense forests, but even
here the sound of the woodman's axe and the little open patch, with
neat log hut, showed the chosen site of a future farm. Vastly
different was the appearance of Indiana, through which we were
speeding the next morning at daylight. Impenetrable swamps choked with
dank and rotten timber sent up their fetid breath under the rays of
the rising sun. Scant and of miserable exterior were the villages
through which we rushed, while the separate settlements bore
unmistakable signs of a poor soil or ill-cultivated land. But soon we
were at Chicago, where a few hours' rest was grateful to at least two
travel-worn and dust-bepowdered people.</p>

 <p>Chicago is quite a miniature Liverpool in its way. Canals and
 docks intersect one portion of the city, and these are crowded with
 the sauciest-looking schooners and most eccentric of steamers,
 gorging and disgorging the produce of the West. Verily, this West
 appears to me to have a mighty destiny in store for it. With its
 lakes and that main artery of America, the Mississippi, throbbing
 with increased vitality through its States, it seems to grasp with
 each hand the North and the South; and who shall predict the future
 result of the war which is now being waged between the opposing
 sections of this giant people, who threescore years ago was the
 youngest-born of the family of nations&#x2014;the birth, as it were, of a
 day&#x2014;and who are now developing their energies and
 revolutionising the theories of the Old World? and who, I ask, shall
 predict the result of this servile war&#x2014;for servile war the
 Abolitionists are making it? The America of the past can never again
 be the America it has been. The West has given its thousands of
 sturdy pioneers to swell the ranks of the Federal army, and to its
 stalwart battalions are due the victories which have restored the
 prestige of the Government; but how long will the West be content to
 sacrifice the choicest of her sons and the commerce which is
 necessary to her? Will she not&#x2014;proud of her achievements in
 the field&#x2014;turn to the East and North and taunt them with their
 shortcomings? Will she not&#x2014;disgusted with the hungering after
 contracts of the North-eastern States and crippled in her own
 resources, removed as she is from the commerce of the Atlantic
 seaboard&#x2014;turn eventually in bitterness from the strife and
 carve out a new destiny for herself, seeking her fortunes with the
 broad streams of the Mississippi and Ohio as an outlet to the riches
 with which her bosom teems? As yet I have seen comparatively little
 of the West; but that little has suggested the substance of the
 foregoing remarks. Already the very people who placed the present
 Executive in power are voting democratic tickets at the elections of
 their State officers, and what all this may eventuate in others more
 profound than myself may determine&#x2014;will there be a further
 dismemberment of this cruelly-distracted country? But pardon me this
 digression; these speculations are probably but idle ones, though I
 have heard many here express sentiments that would give colouring to
 what I have written.</p>

<p> Again the deep bellow of the "bull-gine" was heard, and we rattled
out of the Chicago d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t on to a causeway built 100
yards from the shore and running parallel with the stately marina of
the town. On our left stretched the broad expanse of Lake Michigan,
dotted far and wide with the white wings of swiftly sailing schooners
and the gracefully curling columns of gauzy vapour from the busy
little tug-boats. As I looked on the calmly placid waters my thoughts
were carried back to a certain dark night in the year 1860. A proud
steamer cleaves her way rapidly through the surrounding gloom; sounds
of merriment and the careless laugh of insouciance come from her
brilliantly-lit cabins. But then comes another sound&#x2014;a fearful
crash, followed by one loud shriek of agony and despair&#x2014;the
steamer has gone, and with her in that deep plunge she has buried the
happiness of many families, and left a bitter grief that the waters of
oblivion can never heal. On that dark night a gentleman whom I knew
was hurried, with his eldest son, in the midst of a well-deserved
prosperity to an unlooked-for doom, and this Journal, that owes its
present proud position to his energy and enterprise, lost its founder,
and hosts of artists and literary men a friend. Again I ask your
readers to pardon me for digressing, but this painful reminiscence of
a cruel misfortune has forced itself unwittingly from my pen.</p>

<p>In another hour we were entering the endless plains of Illinois,
the prairie lands&#x2014;so marked a feature of this continent. There
they stretched, broad and expansive, thousands of Salisbury plains
massed into one great area of gently-rolling verdure. At intervals, to
vary this continual monotony of space and sky, we would startle the
quiet of some little town, a settled island, as it were, in a dried-up
inland sea, bringing down the inhabitants in eager groups after the
Chicago papers. It so happened they contained the lists of the killed
Illinoisians at the battle of Pittsburg Landing; and more than one
anxious old man I saw bury his face in his hands as we sped rapidly
onwards: thus did we leave misery in our track, striking down in grief
many who were anxious for our coming. But what was that which
disturbed me from my uneasy slumbers the next morning at daybreak? The
train was almost stationary, and a rushing sound of water beneath the
carriages betokened something unusual. We were in the midst of a
submerged forest, and the line, though eight feet above the level, had
two feet of Mississippi water on it. Slowly we moved along, the
cowcatcher in front of the locomotive throwing off the drifting trunks
of trees, and after ten weary miles at a creeping pace, with fires
nearly extinguished, we rolled on to the lev&#xE9;e at Cairo. The
quantity of water accumulated there now would astonish even Martin
Chuzzlewit and his friend Mark Tapley&#x2014;the only dry land for a
dozen miles round being the aforesaid lev&#xE9;e, which threatened
at any moment to give way, and make a new channel for the Mississippi
(now twenty-five miles broad from the flood) through the valley of
Eden. On the day of my arrival General Pope, with his division from
New Madrid, paused here on his way to Pittsburg Landing, where he was
moving to reinforce General Halleck in front of Corinth. The Sketch
forwarded with this shows his transports ranged along the
lev&#xE9;e, and also the junction of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers
indicated by the line of submerged forests. [This Illustration will
appear in a future number.]</p>

<p>The General in command at Cairo having referred me to the
headquarters of the Western department at St. Louis for permission to
join the  forces on the Tennessee, I am now here waiting a reply from
General Halleck to the request I have preferred through the
authorities left in charge. Every hour may bring me an answer, and,
should it be favourable, which I have every reason to hope it will be,
I shall leave immediately for Pittsburg Landing, arriving in time, I
hope to witness the decisive battle impending between the two mighty
armies arrayed against each other.</p>

<p>More of Cairo and St. Louis in my next. At present I must close to
save the mail.</p>

previously destroyed. On the 10th inst. General Wool landed with 5000
men at Willoughby Point and marched on Norfolk. A delegation of
citizens met him near Norfolk and surrendered the
city. Brigadier-General Viele was appointed Military Governor, and
issued a proclamation assuring the citizens that their rights of property should be respected. The citizens are as disaffected to the Federal Government as those of New Orleans. They greeted the Federal troops with cheers for the Confederate, and groans for the Federal, President.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Huger withdrew with the garrison to reinforce General Johnson. On the 11th the Confederates blew up the celebrated Merrimac, the late reconnaissance of Federal vessels having convinced them of the hopelessness of resistance, and the Merrimac drawing too much water to allow her to escape up any of the rivers.</p>

<p>The vanguard of the main army of General M'Clellan has advanced
beyond New Kent Courthouse, within twenty-two miles of Richmond. The inhabitants have, in nearly every instance, fled before the advance of the invaders. General M'Clellan thinks that the enemy will make a stand at Bottom Bridge, fifteen miles from Richmond, at the head waters of the Chickahominy River. He admits that "the enemy's retreat has been most admirably accomplished, carrying almost everything with them in the shape of forage and provisions, the waggon-trains in the daytime and their troops at night." The report that the main body of the Confederates had retreated to the south side of the James River is untrue.</p>

<p>Released prisoners coming from Richmond on the 12th reported that they passed the Federal steamers Monitor, Nangatuck, and Galena beyond City Point, steaming towards Richmond. The Confederate steamers Jamestown and Yorktown were at Rocketts, about a mile from Richmond.</p>

<p>The Federal General Hunter, commanding the Military Department
of Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina, has issued a proclamation
declaring martial law in those States; and, as martial law and slavery
are incompatible, all slaves in Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina are
declared for ever free.</p>

<p>A coloured pilot and crew had arrived at Port Royal with a steamer
of eight guns which the Confederates had sent from Charleston to
Fort Ripley. The coloured crew seized the steamer and took her to the Federals at Port Royal.</p>

<p>A despatch from Corinth states that the Confederates admit that Pensacola has surrendered to the Federals.</p>

<p>From New Orleans we learn that the Mayor and Aldermen had been sent to prison for refusing to take the oath of allegiance. The greatest dearth of provisions prevailed, and General Butler occupied the St. Charles Hotel as his head-quarters. He sent a proclamation to the newspaper offices for publication, but they refused to print it. A Federal guard was sent to each office, and Northern printers were procured, by whom the proclamation was set up and published.</p>

<p>The Southern papers state that the Federal squadron had arrived off Fort Morgan, to attack Mobile.</p>

<p>General Beauregard has obtained a slight advantage at Farmington, a
place five miles east of Corinth. The brigade of the Federal General
Pope was attacked on the banks of a creek near Farmington. After an
engagement of five hours the Federal forces were driven across the
creek with great loss. Beauregard continues to receive
reinforcements.The Federals estimate the number of his force at
125,000 at the least.</p>
<p>There has been another naval engagement on the Mississippi. Captain Davis reports from above Fort Pillow that on the 10th inst. eight Confederate iron-clad gun-boats attacked the Federal flotilla under Commodore Foote. The action lasted one hour. Two of the Confederate gun-boats were blown up and one sunk, when the rest retired under the guns of the fort. One Federal gun-boat was sunk, and one disabled.</p>

<p>Another iron-clad steamer, christened the Ironsides, had been
launched at Philadelphia.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>President Lincoln had issued a proclamation to the effect that the
blockade of New Orleans, Beaufort, and Port Royal should cease
from June 1 on the following conditions:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>Vessels clearing from foreign ports destined for New Orleans, Beaufort, or Port Royal must obtain licences from American Consuls abroad, which will be granted upon satisfactory evidence that such vessels will convey no person, property, or information contraband of war, either to or from the above port.</p>

<p>&gt;These licences must be exhibited on arrival to the collectors at the above ports.</p>

<p>When cleared outwards from the above ports such vessels must have the collector's clearance, showing that the above conditions have not been violated.</p>

<p>The violation of these conditions will involve the forfeiture and condemnation of vessel and cargo, and exclusion from entering the United States during the war.</p></q>

<p>Congress continues firm in its anti-slavery course. The House of
Representatives had passed a bill abolishing slavery in the
territories of the United States by a vote of 85 against 50. This
bill, if passed into law, will render nugatory the Dred Scott decision. The Senate has voted an appropriation for the education of coloured children in the district of Columbia, for whom no public schools of any kind have hitherto been provided. The Democratic members of Congress have assembled and passed resolutions condemning the policy of the recent measures of emancipation and liberality towards the oppressed race.</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Stanley, of San Francisco, but a native of North
Carolina, has been appointed Military Governor of that
State. Mr. Stanley is one of. those few Southerners who adhered to the
Republican party from its birth.</p>

<p rend="center">RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.</p>
<p>By the time this reaches the hands of our readers it is not only
possible, but extremely probable, that the city of Richmond may be in
the hands of the Federal forces. The latest news announces the
evacuation of the fortified position of the Confederate forces at
Yorktown, and there is a rumour that they have suffered defeat at the
position to which they have retired.</p>

<p>The fall of Richmond would be a far greater blow to the cause of
the South than a similar calamity at New Orleans or
Charleston. Richmond is not only the capital of Virginia, but it is
the capital of what is called the Old Dominion, and is intimately
connected with all the old associations of the early history of the
colony. Most of the remarkable events which happened during that
period when the first colonists were securing their foothold upon this
portion of the American continent took place upon the banks of the
James River.</p>

<p>The colony of Virginia was born at that most remarkable period of English history, "the age of Elizabeth." It was founded by English gentlemen, who carried with them the loyalty, courage, spirit, and chivalric feeling peculiar to the class to which they belonged at home. The Virginians remained a loyal people, and stood by King and Church while Puritanism and Republicanism were rampant in New England. During the civil war between Charles I. and his Parliament the Virginians continued faithful to the Royal cause, and, even after the execution of the King, his son Charles II., although a fugitive from England, was still recognised as the Sovereign of Virginia. Although loyal to the King they showed no want of spirit in claiming such rights as should place them in the position of free men; and numerous important privileges were conceded to them, such as the right of trial by jury; and they claimed and were allowed to have a representative government. Having obtained a right they never allowed it to be wrested from them. The other colonies afterwards planted claimed as extensive privileges as had been conceded to their eider sister, and future proprietaries could hope to win emigrants only by bestowing franchises as large as those enjoyed by Virginia; they, therefore, may be justly said to be the founders of liberty in America.</p>

<p>The early history of the colony is a web of romance in the days when the genius of Raleigh shed its light upon it, when the gallant Smith performed his bold and courageous exploits, and the gentle Indian princess came a visitor to Europe, until the time when she struck for liberty, set an example to future ages, and received the sword of the conquered Cornwallis and his whole army prisoners on the plains at Yorktown. Not one of the States has given so many great names to the nation as this; it is full of hallowed shrines where  great men were either born, lived, died, taught, or fought; and the names of Jefferson, Patrick Henry, Clay, Madison, Monroe, Lee, and a host of others, rise instantly in our memory.</p>

<p>The city of Richmond is situated in the eastern part of the State of
Virginia, upon the James River, at the point where the navigation
ends and the rapids commence. It is about 100 miles south by west of Washington, and is on the great railway mail route from New England to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Richmond is a well-built city, and contains a number of fine
edifices.  It is for the most part situated on the sides of some
hills, which slope towards the river. The principal buildings are of
stone, but the general character of the city, as seen from any
elevated point in the neighbourhood, is that it is built of red
brick. It has all the characteristics of a manufacturing city in
England (except that it is neither black nor dirty): this is caused by
the superior elevation and extent of the numerous tobacco warehouses,
of which the city is full, it being the great d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t for this
famous produce of Virginia. The buildings in which the tobacco is
stored and manufactured are much in external appearance like the
factories in England, being long and many-storied. The population,
previous to the war, was about 35,000, one third of which were black,
either slave or free.</p>

<p>The public buildings are numerous: they consist of the Capitol, the City Hall, the Penitentiary, Custom House, colleges, and about thirty churches.</p>

<p>The Capitol is a fine building, splendidly situated on an eminence
overlooking the James River: the view from the portico is extremely
fine. In the centre of the building is a hall 40ft. square, covered by
a dome, through which the light is admitted. In the centre of this
hall is a marble statue of George Washington, on the pedestal of which
is this inscription:&#x2014;"The General Assembly of the Commonwealth of
Virginia have caused this statue to be erected as a monument of
affection and gratitude to George Washington, who, uniting to the
endowments of the hero the virtues of the patriot, and exerting both
in establishing the liberties of his country, has rendered his name
dear to his fellow-citizens and given the world an immortal example of
true glory. Done in the year of Christ one thousand seven hundred and
eighty-eight, and in year of the Commonwealth the twelfth." The
sculptor has placed his name on the statue; it reads thus: "Fait par
Houdon, citoyen Fran&#xE7;ais, 1788." The figure of Washington is of
the size of life, and the costume is precisely copied from that which
the General wore during the War of Independence. There is no hat on
the head, and the hair is dressed in the fashion of the time; the legs
are placed in large boots strapped to the knee-buttons of the
breeches, which are surmounted by a waistcoat which has large flaps
and capacious pockets. The attitude of the figure is simple and
natural; his hand rests on a bundle of fasces, over which hang his military cloak and a small sword; a plough is ingeniously arranged to complete the group.
Besides this statue in the Capitol there is another, an equestrian
statue on a large scale, elevated upon a pedestal (much too small for
it) which has bas-reliefs upon its sides illustrating remarkable
events that occurred during the war; at the angles are statues of
other men who were eminent either as statesmen or soldiers. There is
also a fine statue of Clay, and the bronze works by the eminent
American sculptor Crawford erected upon the elevated terrace which<pb n="547"/>
surrounds the Capitol. The City Hall is a fine building, situated at
an angle of the Capitol square. The Penitentiary is situated in the
western part of the city, and has a fa&#xE7;ade over 300ft. in length. The Custom House cost half a million dollars. Some of the churches have considerable architectural pretensions. Richmond College was founded by the Baptists in 1832. St. Vincent's College is under the direction of the Catholics. The medical department of Hampden and Sydney Colleges occupies a large building of the Egyptian style of architecture.</p>

<p>There are several large bridges over the wide shallow waters that
run by the town, which connect it with the suburbs of Manchester and
Spring-hill. The navigation extends up to the bridge for small
vessels, such as coasting schooners and small steamers. Immediately
above the bridge the waters tumble over rocks, which are strewed about
in the most picturesque manner, and form beautiful cascades. The views
from the bridges, looking up and down the river and towards the city,
are delightful, the river being split into separate branches, which, uniting at intervals, form pretty little thickly-wooded islands.</p>

<p>In one of the principal streets of Richmond there is a group of
buildings of ordinary character as places of business, but they have
their ground-floor apartments large and open to the
street&#x2014;there may be half a dozen of them in a row, or near
together. Beside the door of each is a little red baize flag, and upon
it is pinned a small piece of paper. An involuntary shudder passes
though the entire frame of an Englishman when he for the first time
reads what is written upon that bit of paper. The announcement is
exceedingly short, but in its half dozen syllables it speaks
volumes. It says:&#x2014;"Negroes for sale at auction this day at
twelve o'clock." How much of human misery is contained in that short
announcement! What a curse has "that institution" brought upon
all the land, all so bountifully treated by the Creator; but this
particular part, Virginia, seems favoured most especially in soil,
climate, beautiful scenery, and contains every gift of nature that can
add to the happiness of those who dwell in it. The slaves in Richmond
are well clothed and fed, and have a happy and contented
look&#x2014;at least it was so before the war broke out. What their
position may be now we have no means of judging.</p>

<p>Richmond is the centre of an important railway system. The Richmond
and Petersburg Railway is its first route southward on the Great
Northern and Southern transit, and the line from Fredricksburg the
first to the northward. The Central Railway, after leaving the city,
makes a long excursion to the north and then turns westward into the
interior of the State, the region of the famous springs. It passes by
Gordonsville, Charlottesville, and Staunton, and it was proposed to
continue it through the State to Guyandotte, on the Ohio River. The
Richmond and Danville Railway runs south-west 141 miles to the upper
boundary of North Carolina, and connects with the railways of
Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas. The city is also connected with
Lynchburg by railway, and thence, by the Virginia and Tennessee line,
with Knoxville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>The Kenawha Canal and the James River extend the communications westward by water nearly 300 miles. The ordinary route from Washington to Richmond before the war was by steam-boat to Aquia Creek, on the Potomac, thence by rail through Fredricksburg to Richmond.</p>

<p>The subjects of our Illustrations of Richmond are, first, a general
view, looking across the river. This view was taken from the top of a
small hill at the southern part of the town: it shows the principal
features of the locality, but not the principal part of the city,
which lies more to the right of the spectator. The second Engraving is
of the quay below the town, where the craft which navigate the James
River lie to discharge and take in their cargoes. The third Engraving
is of the railway bridge which crosses the river at the foot of the
rapids, taken from one of the islands which divide the waters into
separate streams.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 31, 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Victories</hi>, such as they are, but at all
events successive occupations of positions lately held by the
Confederates, are reported by every American mail, and there seems
little ground to doubt that the cause of the South is, in a military
point of view, hopeless. The Confederates are pressed at all points by
the enormous forces opposed to them, and, whether they gain a battle
here or repulse an attack there, such items will go for nothing in the
general account. The Merrimac, hitherto valued as equal to an army of
50,000 men, has been blown to pieces to prevent her falling into
Federal hands, and all other war material at Norfolk has been
similarly dealt with, though it is alleged that the Federal commanders
might have prevented the destruction by some display of the dash
which has been so singularly deficient in this war. General M'Clellan
was, by the last advices, stated to be pursuing the Confederate force
that so hastily abandoned the peninsula where the work of Sebastopol
was to have been done over again, and, from the positions of the
armies that were to support him, there seemed every chance of that
portion of the Southern force being checkmated. Only where Halleck and
Beauregard continue to look at one another was there hope for the
Confederates, and this hope was not worth much amid the circumstances
of the campaign. But anxiety as to the Federal army was openly
expressed, and Government had forbidden the publication of any news
from Corinth. Mr. Jefferson Davis had named a day for humiliation and
prayer. The bitter hatred of the South for the

"Yankee" was becoming more deep and deadly, and it is manifest that,
though the Confederation may be suppressed by force of arms, no
reunion, in the true sense of the word, can be possible. As if to make
the breach wider, the Senate had passed a bill enfranchising the
slaves in all the Territories, and the threat was that all the States
that did not at once rejoin the Union in a loyal way should be reduced
to the territorial condition. Flushed with conquest, the North
announces that it never can again be the peaceful nation which it
curiously discovers itself always to have been, and begs England to
revise her rule of behaviour; to avoid abolition talk; to dismiss
Ministers who are disliked in the States; and by such submissions to
avoid the anger of the now martial Republic. We are, of course, duly
schooled, but have not sent back the Emily St Pierre.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Jura and Edinburgh we are in receipt of news to the 24th ult.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS ON LAND AND SEA.</p>

<p>General M'Clellan continues his advance on Richmond without
encountering any serious impediment. A portion of his army had crossed the Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge; another division crossed the Chickahominy at New Bridge; seven miles further up, and within eight miles of Richmond. The Federal vanguard is reported to be five miles from the Southern capital, to which point the Confederates had fallen back without any real resistance.</p>

<p>Nothing further has been done by the gun-boats on the James River.
The report that the Federals lost above 1000 men on that occasion was
a gross exaggeration. The report of the surgeon gives 13 killed and
11 wounded on the Galena; to which may be added 17 killed in the Nangatuck by the explosion of her gun.</p>

<p>The Mayor and City Council of Norfolk having refused to take the oath of allegiance, and a general spirit of resistance among the citizens having manifested itself, General Wool had declared martial law, and announced that Norfolk would be cut off from trade and commerce unless the people returned to their allegiance.</p>

<p>General Banks has suffered a check in the valley of the Shenandoah. The Confederates, under General Jackson, had driven the Federal Colonel Bentley's command from Front Royal with considerable loss, and taken possession of the place.</p>

<p>The "guerrillas" are active in Western Virginia in harassing the
Federals under Fremont.</p>

<p>Pensacola was evacuated by the Confederates on the 9th ult., after
 destroying the Navy-yard and the forts. The city had been occupied
by the Federals.</p>

<p>Advices from Key West report that the British iron steamer
Circassian, with a cargo of tea, silk, coffee, and munitions of war,
valued at 1,000,000 dols., had been seized by the blockading fleet.</p>

<p>The flotilla of Commodore Farragut had advanced up the Mississippi
to Vicksburg, 400 miles from New Orleans, without meeting any
resistance.</p>

<p>From the Upper Mississippi it is reported that the Confederates have
abandoned Fort Wright, and fallen back on Fort Randolph.</p>

<p>Active skirmishing goes on between the armies of Beauregard and Halleck near Corinth. That of the former is said to be suffering much from sickness and paucity of food.</p>

<p rend="center"> WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The War Department had issued a call for a fresh levy of volunteers. All the recruiting stations are reopened.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward had notified the foreign Ministers that the blockade of
the several seaport towns in the occupation of the Federals had ceased; but that the mails and trade would be subject to military surveillance.</p>

<p>The House of Representatives have passed a bill by a majority of 32
for giving grants of land and loaning the public credit to a company
formed to construct the Pacific Railroad. The route chosen is known as
the "middle" route, and starts from Western Kansas.</p>

<p>The United States' District Court had ordered the restitution of the British steamer Labuan, the seizure off the Rio Grande and the Mexican coast being declared illegal.</p>

<p>A collision between the police and the military had occurred in the
streets of Washington. A body of police, provided with the proper writs, seized two negroes from the ranks and placed them in gaol. An effort was made to arrest six or eight other fugitives in the same manner, when the soldiers pointed their muskets and forced the police to desist from their enterprise.</p>

<p>Richmond papers of the 16th contain a correspondence between Mr. Davis and the Virginia Legislature in regard to the recent movements of the rebel army. He states that he never intended to withdraw the army from Virginia; that if in the course of events Richmond should fall, the necessity of which he did not see or anticipate, that would be no reason for withdrawing the army from Virginia. In his opinion the war could be successfully carried on on Virginia soil for twenty years.</p>

<p rend="center">LITERATURE.</p>
<p>...In the titlepage of his new work, <hi rend="italic">North
America</hi>, which has been recently published by Messrs. Chapman and
Hall, Mr. Anthony Trollope mentions his authorship of "The West Indies
and the Spanish Main," which is appropriate, and leading up to his
latest book of travels; but he also refers to such works as "Doctor
Thorne" and "Orley Farm," an announcement which might lead intending
readers to ideas with regard to that which they were about to peruse,
which would be erroneous. What we mean is, that it might be supposed
that Mr. Trollope was about to exercise his well-known power as a
humorist and delineator of manners from a bantering point of view, and
that we should find America and the Americans treated in the style of
"Framley Parsonage." It may, therefore, be necessary to warn those
whose attention we desire to turn to this book that they must expect
nothing of the kind. Mr. Trollope writes with a seriousness probably
caught from the contemplation of what he states to have been a long
cherished purpose. It appears that it has been the ambition of his
life to write a book about the United States, and he had made up his
mind to visit the country with that object before the intestine
troubles of the United States' Government had commenced. He has not
allowed the division amongst the States and the breaking out of civil
war to interfere with his intention; although, naturally enough, he
says that he should not purposely have chosen that period either for
his book or his visit. It is probable that his readers would have been
glad if it had happened otherwise. He wishes it to be understood that
it is not his special purpose to write an account of the struggle as
far as it has yet been carried, but that his wish is to describe, as
well as he can, the present social and political state of the
country. This he should have attempted, with more personal
satisfaction in the work, had there been no disruption between the
North and South; but he has not allowed that disruption to deter him
from an object which, if it had been delayed, might probably never
have been carried out. He was therefore forced to take the subject in
its present condition, and, being so forced, he has been compelled to
write of the war, of the causes which have led to it, and of it
probable termination; but he pointedly declares that it was not his
selected task to do so, and it was not his primary object. Perhaps the
latent primary object peeps out in another statement, in which he
recalls to recollection that thirty years ago his mother wrote a book
about the Americans which was a well-known and successful work. It
was, however, Mr. Trollope thinks, essentially a woman's
book. Mrs. Trollope saw with a woman's keen eye, and described with a
woman's light and graphic pen (may not this description stand for the
previous efforts of her son?) the social defects and absurdities which
our near relatives had adopted into their domestic life. All that she
told, he says, was worth the telling, and the telling, if done
successfully, was sure to produce a good result, and he is satisfied
that it did so. But he is of opinion that she did not regard it as a
part of her work to dilate on the nature and operation of those
political arrangements which had produced the social absurdities which
she saw, or to explain that, though such absurdities were the natural
result of those arrangements in their newness, the defects would
certainly pass away, while the political arrangements, if good, would
remain. Such a work, he believes, is fitter for a man than a
woman. There is, therefore, a sort of filial feeling involved in the
undertaking, and a laudable desire to make "Trollope on America"
complete has been the main motive cause of this publication. With
sufficient modesty the author disclaims any notion that he thinks it
is a task which he can perform with entire satisfaction either to
himself or to others, but no doubt the reading public are willing to
give him the credit he deserves for possessing many of the qualities
for the duty he has undertaken, and they expect at once an agreeable
and an able book. There is good sense as well as good feeling evinced
in Mr. Trollope's declaration of a desire to do something to add to
the familiarity of Englishmen with Americans. He says, with some
reason, that the writings which have been most popular in England on
the subject of the United States have hitherto dealt chiefly with
social details, and, though in most cases true and useful, have
created laughter on one side of the Atlantic and soreness on the
other, and he consequently feels a desire to do what he can to
mitigate the soreness and add to the good feeling which should exist
between two nations which ought to love each other well, and which do
hang upon each other very constantly. It is in this spirit that our
author started for Boston on the 24th <sic>or</sic> August, 1861, with the design
of staying in America over the winter, and returning in the spring;
and this programme he carried out with sufficient exactness. The
account of the rather discursive route of the traveller through Maine,
New Hampshire, and Vermont, thence through Lower and Upper Canada to
Niagara, and thence to the Mississippi, back to New York, and
Boston, Cambridge, and Lowell to Washington, is interpersed with
somewhat elaborate disquisitions on the causes and prospects of the
war, and such social questions as the rights of women as they are
considered in America, and the educational system of the States, with
a touch here and there of manners, under such headings as "American
Insolence." A long leap is next made to St. Louis, which is about as
far south as the author seems to have reached. Long chapters are
devoted to the Constitution of the United States, its government, its
law courts and lawyers, the post-office, and the financial position of
the country. Of course there is a chapter on "hotels," and here there
is, perhaps, a slight infusion of Mr. Trollope's ordinary style, but
not much. In the section devoted to literature even-handed justice
seems to be dealt out to merits and defects, as might be expected from
one whose experience must have matured his judgment. On the whole,
this is a serious, solid, sensible, well-written book; but if any one
expects that it displays any striking specialty, or that a writer of
peculiar powers has dealt with a comparatively familiar subject in a
peculiar way, we think they will be disappointed. But the evident care
which has been bestowed upon it will, even after the prestige of the
author's name has been dissipated, entitle it to hold the place in
public estimation which, as we think, the writer designed it to
occupy. </p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CONTEST IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> most recent accounts of the
internecine struggle which is going on in the Republican States of
North America give little hope of any approaching settlement of the
unhappy differences between the North and South. On the contrary, all
that we know seems to indicate the beginning of a new phase in the
contest. The military policy, the strategy, or by whatever name it may
called, of the Southern leaders appears to have been based on the
course which the Russian Generals adopted in the face of the French
invaders. A gradual retirement before the advancing forces through a
country laid desolate with a view to draw them as far as possible from
their sources of supply is a game which, if well played, is tolerably
sure to be successful in the end, and the approach of its results may
generally be calculated by days. As matters stood when the last
advices left America, it would seem that the time had arrived when the
Confederates believed that a stand was to be made, and we believe that
more serious fighting is imminent than has yet taken
place. Recollecting that the statements which reach Europe come from
Federal sources, it is quite clear that the authorities of the North
do not underrate the seriousness of this crisis. In truth, in some
degree they would seem to overrate it, for there has been something
very <sic corr="nearly">neary</sic> akin to a panic amongst the
Federals. If it be the fact that the President of the United States
has over half a million of men under arms, notwithstanding the
division of that force into several corps-d'arm&#xE9;e, operating on
different points and extended over an enormous tract of country, yet
the bodies which are acting in concert in Virginia and its
neighbourhood are each sufficiently strong; and therefore it argues a
grave condition of affairs when we hear that alarm is felt for the
safety of Washington, that a demand of 150,000 militia is made for
its defence, and that volunteer regiments
have absolutely been sent from New York for this purpose. Can it be
that climate and disease are already doing their fell work on the
thousands of the North who have been drawn towards those regions of the
South where fever is a more dreaded foe than myriads of armed men? At
any rate, whereas a fortnight or three weeks ago recruiting for the
Northern forces had been stopped, we now hear of pressing demands for
a new and extraordinary levies.</p>
<p>The great motive cause of that which we will delicately designate a
little nervousness in the North has, of course, been the defeat of
General Banks at the battle of Winchester.  Previously to this,
General Halleck, who had gained a victory over the Confederates, had
somehow found it either necessary or convenient to remain in a state
of inactivity; in fact, his advance was practically stopped; while
General M'Clellan, with characteristic caution, having felt his way,
intimated that, owing to the large force opposed to him, he was not
likely to make any very dashing onset. When, however, General Banks's
defeat was followed by the expulsion of the Federal army from
Virginia, the matter reached in the eyes of the Northerns the height
of disaster, and an immediate advance of the Confederates upon
Washington was taken for granted. No doubt, such a step would prove an
immense moral advantage to the Southerners, and the occupation of the
capital of the Federal Union would be, however shortlived, at once a
triumph and a benefit to their cause; but it is not very probable that
they would or could take any such step. It would be inconsistent with
the plan which, as far as we can judge, they have adopted, and so far
with success. It is no little matter for them that their line touches
once more upon the Potomac, and that the important State of Virginia
is as far as ever from being in the

<pb n="600"/>possession of the
Federals. While the Northern forces, numerically large as they are,
have, as we have said, been drawn upon by the corps necessary to
operate against the coast cities of the South, so that the bodies
which have advanced from the Potomac in what may be called the
invasion of the South inland are strong but not overwhelming in
numbers, the Confederates appear to have concentrated their troops for
the purpose of defending their land frontier. In Virginia, in
Kentucky, and Tennessee, they were holding their own at the last
accounts. It is understood that Beauregard, giving up his command at
Corinth, has gone to encounter M'Clellan, and it is probable that a
great battle will be fought between these, who have been hitherto what
may be termed the representative Generals of the contending
parties. How long before such a consummation will be achieved it is at
present not easy to say. The campaign is becoming one of slow and
cautious movements of intrenchments and that sort of attack and
defence which is not usually indicative of a fight in the open
field. A new levy of 100,000 men has been called for by President
Lincoln for his regular army, and this implies time for recruiting,
for drilling, and organisation; and therefore it is clear that he at
least does not contemplate a speedy cessation of the war.</p>

 <p>It is with astonishment that we see what must be deemed a revival
 of the strength of the Confederates. One wonders whence they draw
 their resources and how they contrive to keep up the large armies
 which are now coming into play in a manner which was certainly not expected of them a week or two since. What is now demonstrable to the most sanguine believer of a comparatively early triumph by the Federals over the Seceders is, that the crowning conquest is by no means at hand. It is not likely now that a great battle fought between any of the different corps which are in presence of each other would be decisive of the fate of the war. The dreams of a ninety days' contest are still dissolving, and that in a more rapid ratio than before; and, while blood and treasure are being poured out day by day, all things portend that the measure of the flow of both cannot yet be calculated. It is, of course, not to be expected that those who are entirely engaged in this strife, which is the last arbitrement of difference of opinion, can reason on its ultimate effects, or calmly sit down to count the cost. But there must be many thinking men in America who concur with thinking men in England in mourning over the advent of circumstances which point to an indefinite prolongation of warfare in that fair region of the West, which has been long a land of promise to those who could not find sufficient room in the old country. The diplomatists of Europe know well the difficulty, not to say the danger, of interference in the internal affairs of a people so sensitive and so proud as the Americans; but may it not be insinuated that the time is approaching when some friendly attempt might be made to bring on at least an armistice, with a view to giving opportunity to both sides to consider their relative positions, undisturbed by the passionate impulses which stir the blood of men with arms in their hands and placed front to front with an enemy? We would not counsel, we would not suggest, any intervention in the strict sense of the term ; but in the interests of humanity it is desirable that some endeavour should be made merely to procure a cessation of hostilities during the season which is even now upon those large bodies of men collected in districts where they must be decimated, at the very least, by disease.</p>

<p> No one denies the resources of America, and indeed, if they had
been doubted before, the events of the last twelve months would have
dissipated every difficulty of belief in their extent; but even such
powers of raising and maintaining armies as this young country has
developed must have their limit. Even now one dreads to contemplate
the hereafter of this civil war. Something has been said, with an
affectation of philosophy, that, after all, the ordeal which America
is going through will only result in making her that what she has
hitherto not been in the most positive sense&#x2014;a nation. It is
true that history teaches us that most countries have had fiery trials
to encounter ere they culminated into nations; and amongst them the
baptism in blood, domestic as well as foreign, has been so prominent
as to cause it to be supposed to have been essential. But in most of
the instances to which reference can be made, so far as Europe is
concerned, the ordeal has fallen upon ruder times, upon a less
advanced stage of civilisation, and, in most respects, upon a
different condition of national affairs than that which prevailed in
America when she drifted into civil war. Much that we in England had
to fight hard for, to win by the exercise of physical, as
distinguished from moral, force, America possessed more than
sufficiently when she went to war on a question of ascendancy between
certain sections of her population. Each party is now fighting for an
idea, which will be an idea so long as they continue to fight, but
which, so far as the North is concerned, might become a reality by
means of negotiations carried on in a wise and temperate spirit. Let
it not be supposed that we speak in any offensive sense (we view this
contest in all its bearings with too profound a sorrow knowingly to
utter anything which could be construed into offence) if we venture to
say that it is at last becoming doubtful whether slavery and its
abolition and continuance, as the case may be, is now the motive
influence in the struggle between the North and South. It is a
struggle for victory and ascendancy on the one hand and for
independence on the other. The elements of cohesion between North and
South, always of the slightest, are now dispersed, dissipated,
gone. Assuming a conquest by the North, a nominal reintegration of the
Union as it stood two years ago, there would only be created a state
of things to which the relative positions of Austria and Hungary
afford a parallel. It is admitted by men in America who are strong
advocates of that freedom of institution and of person which has
hitherto prevailed in the Transatlantic Republic that such a union
could only be maintained by the establishment of a standing army of
500,000 men, and that it might even be necessary to convert the form
of government into a military despotism in order to the accomplishment
of that ideal confederation of all those provinces which in
combination went by the name of the United States. This is, to say the
least of it, a curious picture of the future of the freest country in
all creation. To us it is by no means a pleasant one to
contemplate. It implies a military nation, and, by consequence, an
aggressive one; and, in a dim future, one beholds fierce wars between
the old countries and the new, waged for the purpose of checking
aggrandisement on the part of the latter, or even on the part of
America for that false deity, the influence of which is beginning to
fail even amongst the most infatuated of its worshippers in Europe,
and which has been known under the name of Glory! Something like this
is indicated in that notion which is coming uppermost, to which we
have previously alluded, that of making America a nation. Assuming
that that consummation is yet to be arrived at, which we are very far
indeed from admitting, is it necessary that, like the Israelites, she
must pass through a desert in order to become a nation?</p></div2>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan was no nearer to Richmond at last advices than he
was a week previous. On the 27th his forces captured Hanover Courthouse, where the Confederates suffered a loss of 1000 men. The
Federal casualties were estimated at 370 killed, wounded, and missing. By the burning of a bridge across a creek on the line of the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad, communication is cut off
between Richmond and the army of General Jackson.</p>

<p>The Federal fleet of gun-boats still remains about fifteen miles
below Richmond.</p>

<p>General M'Dowell has crossed the Rappahannock, and advanced six miles beyond Fredericksburg. The Confederates retreated, destroying the bridges behind them.</p>

<p>The most important event of the week in Virginia is the retreat,
reinforcement, and second advance of General Banks. After falling back
upon Winchester, as previously reported, General Banks was attacked,
at daybreak on the 25th ult,, by a corps-d'arm&#xE9;e of 15,000 men
under Generals Ewell and Johnstone, his own force consisting of only
4000 men, to which number it had been reduced by reinforcing General
M'Dowell. The Federals retreated through Martinsburg to Williamsburg,
and crossed the Potomac at Williamsport into Maryland. The
Confederates kept up an active pursuit along the route. At Winchester
the Federals were fired upon by the women armed with
pistols. Complaints of the cruelties practised by the Confederates on the sick and wounded of the retreating force are renewed. General Banks admits his loss was large, but cannot state the exact amount. The loss of military stores, including fifty waggon-trains, is heavy.</p>

<p> General Banks's command was immediately reinforced, and be

forthwith advanced again into Virginia. He re-entered Front Royal on the 30th and drove out the enemy, capturing many prisoners and much materiel. He advanced beyond Martinsburg the next day.</p>

<p>The Confederates evacuated Corinth on the 29th. They retreated to Grand Junction, and thence southward. They destroyed an immense amount of public and private property, stores, provisions, waggons, tents, &amp;c. For miles out of the town the roads were filled with arms, haversacks, &amp;c., thrown away by his fleeing troops. A large number, of prisoners and deserters were captured. General Halleck adds:&#x2014;</p>

<q><p>General Beauregard evidently distrusts his army or he would have
defended so strong a position. His troops are generally much
discouraged and demoralised. In all their engagements for the last few
days their resistance  has been slight.</p></q>

<p>The Federal fleet had captured Natchez, on the Mississippi. No resistance was offered.</p>

<p>Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas, had been occupied by the Federals.</p>

<p rend="center">THE OCCUPIED TERRITORY.</p>

<p>Nowhere is there any revival of Union sentiment worth speaking of. In New Orleans General Butler continues to govern with military rigour. Several papers had been suppressed. All women who insulted the Federal officers were to be imprisoned in the Calaboose as prostitutes. The circulation of Confederate notes was forbidden. Six persons had been condemned to be shot for violating their parole. General Butler, having seized 100,000 dollars at the Dutch Consulate&#x2014;said on the one hand to belong to Messrs. Hope Brothers, of Amsterdam, and on the other to a bank in New Orleans&#x2014;the foreign Consuls had unanimously protested against the act. General Butler stands by his seizure. Some British subjects charged with sending arms to Beauregard had been imprisoned. The British Consul had opened a correspondence with General Butler concerning their release.</p>

<p>Troubles had broken out in Western Tennessee. Norfolk continued contumacious, although about 1500 citizens had taken the oath of allegiance. The garrison had fallen out with the negroes and killed several of them.</p>

<p>As the invading forces advance into Virginia they admit the residents become more bitterly hostile.</p>

<p>At Norfolk the Federal General Viele, by special invitation of the officers, paid a visit to the British war-steamer Rinaldo. He was received with the honours of a salute and the manning of the yards. The American ensign was displayed at the fore.</p>

<p rend="center">CONGRESS.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawes, in a speech in Congress, stated that the national debt at that moment amounted to 481,000,000 dol.</p>

<p rend="center">THE NORTHERN STATES.</p>

<p>The excitement caused by the retreat of General Banks, and the real or supposed peril of Washington, was equal to that which ensued on the fall of Fort Sumter. The President having called for 50,000 more volunteers, about 250,000 were forthwith offered. The aristocratic 7th Regiment of New York left the city for Washington at a few hours' notice, numbering 800. Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, who had previously warned President Lincoln that Massachusetts could only furnish a few more troops unless the emancipation policy was pursued, changed his tone, and called on the people of his State to save the capital from "the wily and barbarous horde of traitors."

<p>We have elsewhere dealt with the later details of the great
American struggle, and it will suffice to add here that a tentative
demonstration is being made in France and England with a view to an
attempt at mediation. Of the feasibility of such a course, and of the
wisdom which may or may not have been shown in the selection of an
opportunity, results alone can enable us to speak with any certainty;
for the singular temper of the American people, and their willingness
to accept submissively from one nation what they would scornfully
reject if tendered by another, are circumstances which defeat ordinary
calculation of probabilities. The leading organs of the North have,
however, of late altered their tone towards France; and<pb n="605"/>
the series of Federal successes has so exalted the minds of the journalists and those whose feelings they represent that they now do not scruple to apprise the Emperor Napoleon that the services which the Orleans Princes have rendered to the North may justify it in considering, in the event of his taking any line that is disrespectful to the Union, whether American arms may not properly be employed to restore the throne of Louis Philippe to the family that has done so much for the Federals in their time of trouble.</p></div2>

<p>The Great Eastern has just finished another successful voyage
from New York to Liverpool, at which port she arrived on Wednesday
morning, after a detention of nine hours outside the bar for want of
water. She left New York on the morning of the 1st of June, and so great was the desire of shippers to send their produce by this vessel that upwards of &#xA3;1000 worth of freight was left behind. The big ship brings 500 passengers, 56,000 dols. in specie, and upwards of 6000 tons of cargo&#x2014;consisting principally of wheat, corn, and provisions. While lying at New York the Great Eastern was opened for a few days for exhibition, and upwards of 3000 people daily visited the vessel. On the voyage to Liverpool the ship encountered very severe head winds, yet so steady was her motion that the doctor had a" clean bill of health" all the way.</p>

<p>A parallel case to that of the recapture of the Emily St. Pierre
is thus given in the<hi rend="italic"> London Journal</hi>, of June 9, 1722:&#x2014;" On the 13th of May
last the ship Gilbert, Othniel Beale, master, from Boston, in New
England, on his passage from South Carolina, for London, was taken in
the English Channel by an Algerine of 38 guns and 400 men, who took
out some of the said ship's cargo and all her men except the master, a
mate, and a boy, and put on board the second captain of the said
Algerine and thirteen men, in order to carry her as a prize to Algiers; upon which they made the best of their way for the coast of Barbary, leaving the privateer in the Channel. They prosecuted their voyage for twelve days, when the master, by a stratagem, regained possession of his ship and brought her safe to the River Thames, with the said

fourteen Turks on board." </p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist communicates a few
particulars respecting the engagement off Fort Pillow, Mississippi
River, between Federal and Confederate gun-boats:&#x2014;"Early on the
morning of the 10th (he says) we were aroused by three or four shots
in rapid succession from one of our gun-boats, and, hastening on deck,
saw the Southern fleet rounding the point that divides us from Fort
Pillow. Four of their vessels came swiftly on under a full head of
steam, two of them making direct for the Cincinnati that had advanced
to meet them. They were iron-prowed, and handled as rams. In a few
minutes they were both on to her, striking her with crushing force on
her port quarter; but before they could get clear she gave them the
contents of those of her 10-inch guns that could be trained to bear,
both of them drifting down stream, disabled, towards Fort Pillow. The
Cincinnati, whose timbers were completely crushed in, was towed to the
shores and grounded to preserve her from sinking; while the Benton
(flag-boat) advanced to meet the two remaining rams, supported by the
Carondelet. she gave all her guns in succession to one of them and
blew up her boilers, which caused her to drift after her consorts, the
other making tracks at full speed. The balance of the Confederate
fleet, which held off, then retired. In addition to the damage done to
our boats, the Captain of the Cincinnati was mortally wounded and the
Master killed. Three of the Confederate steamers are reported to have
sunk after rounding the point. The Federal gun-boats have iron-plated
sides placed in perpendicular bars on the timbers, and when in action
no one appears on deck bu the signalmen, the vessels being steered from a
shotproof pilot-house forwards. The Cincinnati was struck on an
exposed portion of her frame. The Confederate boats had their guns on
the spar-deck sheltered by cotton-bales.</p>
<p>On the first page we have an Engraving showing "Jeff Thompson's
Guerrillas Shooting at Government Boats on the Mississippi," from a
Sketch by our Special Artist, who writes regarding it as
follows;&#x2014;"This incident happened to the boat on which I have
established my head-quarters, and the attempt was made on her from the
Arkansas shore just above the first Chickasaw Bluff. We distinctly saw
the rascals, and a strong party was put on shore to capture them, if
possible, but they were too well acquainted with the woods, and
escaped. We risk at any moment being fired into from the bank; and the
unfortunate individual who would attempt to land alone and unarmed on
a foraging expedition is almost certain to fall into the hands of the
these ruffians, for such they should be called from their acts. The
chivalrous Southern Confederacy does not appear particular as to the
means it employs to attain its ends."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.<lb/><hi rend="italic">(From our Special Artist and
Correspondent.)</hi></p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Mississippi Flotilla</hi>, near Fort
Pillow,</p>
<p rend="right">75 miles above Memphis, May 14.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> last you heard of me was waiting in
St. Louis for a reply from General Halleck to a request I had made for
permission to join his army in front of Corinth. His answer I have now
received, and it is difficult to determine whether a favourable
construction may be put upon it or not; at all events, as yet it has
done little to advance me on my proposed journey up the Tennessee
River. All vessels communicating with the grand army of the West are
in the employ of the Federal authorities, and there is no route open
that I am aware of that would enable one to reach the impending scene
of conflict by land. Now, General Halleck in his reply states that he
can give me no facilities to travel on Government transports (there are
no others), and that he has laid down a rule excluding civilians from
the lines of his army, which he is indisposed to depart from in the
present instance; yet he would wish me to enjoy the same privileges
that are accorded to American correspondents. What these may be I am
unable, from the tenor of the General's letter, to ascertain, unless
Transatlantic journalists are supposed to provide for their
transportation by each man paddling his own canoe. The distance from
Cairo to Pittsburg Landing, which is the nearest point to Corinth, is
over two hundred miles, and as I am not in a position to charter a
steamer specially to carry me, or swim up the Ohio and Tennessee
Rivers, I have availed myself of the courtesy of the naval authorities
on the Mississippi, and am now writing to you from the gun-boat
flotilla off Fort Pillow. I shall avail myself of the first
opportunity that offers itself for reaching Corinth; but in the mean
time I will endeavour to find subjects of interest on the river flank,
such as the probable taking within the next few days of Fort Pillow,
followed by the capture of Memphis.</p>

<p>I take it that the opening of the Mississippi is not the least
important among the many movements of the Federal forces; indeed, it
appears to me that Peace and Commerce, hand in hand, will float down
its broad bosom in the wake of the flotilla, restoring confidence on
their way by recalling the suffering disaffected to their former
avocations. Already numbers of refugees from the Confederate
strongholds below us have penetrated through the submerged forests in
"dug outs," and have requested to be allowed to take the oath of
allegiance to the old Government. Their description of the condition
of Memphis would scarcely indicate that the population is over
sanguine as to the result of the struggle progressing or that its
confidence is great in the ultimate success of Confederacy. They say
that the more quiet and law-abiding portion of the people are crushed
and held in subjection by the military authorities, and that hundreds
would welcome the appearance of the Federal fleet and the restoration
of their former condition of order and prosperity. No doubt the
destruction of property will be great on the approach of the flotilla,
but this will be simply because the citizens are powerless to prevent
it; and I am strengthened in this opinion from a conversation I have
had with a Memphis merchant who is on the same boat as
myself. Possibly, however, these fugitives may wish to represent
matters to the Federal commander in a <hi rend="italic">couleur de
rose</hi> tint, and therefore their statements should perhaps be
accepted with considerable reservation; yet I cannot conceive they
would fly from their homes and seek the protection of Uncle Sam had
not their convictions undergone a change, and their confidence in Jeff
Davis and his power to sustain his Government been greatly
diminished.</p>
<p>There is no disguising one fact. The South is now reduced to a
general conscription, or rather, force-draughting of men, who
apparently, unless compelled, betray little inclination to take up
arms, or "wade waist-deep in blood in defence of the Southern rights,"
as the Richmond and other journals in the Confederacy have asserted
every man would do. This extreme measure, sanctioned by the
Confederate Congress, has hastened the flight of many of those who
were wavering and created considerable dissatisfaction among those who
remain. In all conscience, I have had little to thank some of the
Federal authorities for lately, and cannot therefore be suspected of
any blind partiality; yet it would be base and dishonest in me to
conceal from your readers that Secession is in a very bad way just
now, and a look into the future does not promise much improvement in
its condition. The army of the Potomac, that I should have been with,
is reaping its laurels by acres in front of Richmond and wiping out
the disgrace of Bull Run. Norfolk has fallen; and Burnside, with his
miniature army, is rapidly closing his grasp on North Carolina. Fort
Pulaski has been reduced, and Charleston may at any hour be attacked by
Hunter; while the mortar fleet under Porter and Farragut has achieved
a most important victory in the capture of New Orleans, the metropolis
of the South. The great question in the West is about to be decided in
front of Corinth, and, <pb n="608"/>should that place and Richmond
fall before the armies of Halleck and M'Clellan, I see no further hope
for the Southern Confederacy. The resources of the South must fail
under this accumulation of disaster, and the prodigal loss of cannon
and other mat&#xE9;riel of war to which the Confederates have
latterly been subjected must sooner or later deprive them of the means
of carrying on the contest. I have spoken with numerous deserters,
prisoners, and others, and they have, with few exceptions, expressed
themselves heartily sick of the war, and state that a feeling of
dissatisfaction and weariness is gradually displaying itself
throughout the Southern Army. This is hardly to be marvelled

at, when we take into consideration the numerous reverses the
Confederates have met with and the demoralising influence they must
have had upon the men. If your readers will glance back at the long
list of successes that have latterly crowned the Federal arms, they
will notice among the more prominent the following:&#x2014;Mill Spring
(where Zollicoffer was killed), Roanoke, Fort Henry, Donnelson, Pea
Ridge, Newberne, Shiloh, Pulaski, Fort Macon, Island No. 10, Yorktown,
Williamsburg, Norfolk, and New Orleans. We know that most of the
cannon they possessed were taken from Norfolk Navy-yard, and of these
they have lost a considerable number, which it will be difficult, or
next to impossible, for them to replace, as they have not the means
and appliances within themselves to produce them like the North. They
are dependent on outside aid for smallarms, the greater portion of
their men being furnished with simple shot-guns or renovated old flint
locks, while powder is nearly three times as dear with them as it is
with the Federals. We find that each day the North is developing her
gigantic resources; all her foundries are busily engaged in the
manufacture of improved artillery; iron-clad gun-boats of models that
revolutionise naval architecture, grow upon her ways, and regiment
after regiment of well-equipped soldiers flow in legions from her
States, and the cry is still "They come !" Can the South, in
the face of all this, maintain their ground? I doubt it. She is not
wanting in her thousands of gallant men; but I am of opinion, as I
said before, that her army is growing weary; and this fact cannot be
more strongly demonstrated than by the measure to which the
Confederate Government has been compelled of forced
enlistments. Recollect that as yet the Federal army has been composed
entirely of volunteers; and, from my own experience, I believe that,
were it absolutely necessary, as many more could be obtained. Again
the reinforcements that Beauregard is collecting round him at Corinth
are new levies, comparatively unarmed, uninformed, and certainly
undisciplined, and most of them have been impressed against their
inclinations&#x2014;at least such would appear to be the case if we
may place reliance on deserters and others. What the effect of
bringing such men into action will be I leave your readers to judge,
though I thoroughly believe that when the final battle is fought on
the Tennessee it will probably be the most desperate of the war. The
Western men that will be brought to meet the Southern army are the
finest soldiers in the rough I have ever seen, and among them are
really numerous regiments that are marvellously well disciplined for the time
they have been in the field. Taking all these facts into
consideration, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that Secession
is in a most desperate strait.</p>

<p>I have taken my first voyage on the Mississippi, the "father of
waters," and am now living on its broad bosom with the Tennessee shore
on one side and Arkansas on the other. But I am wrong in using the
word "shore," for there really is none&#x2014;nothing but submerged
forests for miles and miles back, with here and there a clearing
showing the locality of a plantation with the roofs of the planter's
house and negro quarters dotting the surface of the widely-spreading
waters like so many drifting Noah's arks. This is the greatest rise the
Mississippi has known for years, and materially has it assisted the
Federalists in their operations on the river, while to the South it
has brought nothing but disaster, washing out their water batteries
and swelling every little channel through many of which the Union
gun-boats could not otherwise have passed. Probably I could not have
seen this mighty river under circumstances more favourable to impress
me with its grandeur, an ocean in volume flowing through a valley of
over three thousand miles in extent.</p>

<p>Leaving St. Louis late in the afternoon, I found myself steaming
down its rapid current in one of those floating palaces, perfect
marvels of steam-boat architecture. On my left lay the flooded
low-lands of Illinois, and on my right the foliated bluffs of Missouri
reflecting their dark masses deep into the eddying stream, while away
in the west crimsoning zephyr clouds, enpurpling distant forests and
suffusing the firmament with richly glowing tints, sank the sun to
rest, "setting his burning seal upon the close of day." Then rose from
wood and water a gauzy veil of violet-toned mist, exaggerating
distances, and making vast and indefinite, in the overspreading gloom,
the dark boundaries of forest that marked the course of this giant of
rivers. Away we sped, through the portals of evening into the halls of
night, anon shooting a red glare from our open furnaces across the
black waters, and flashing from the obscurity some island of eccentric
form. Hour after hour did I sit on the forward guards, waiting for the
rising of the moon, and lost in reveries suggested by the occasion. In
every drifting snag that passed from gloom to gloom my imagination saw
a canoe, and its branches, surmounted by tufts of foliage, gave the
Indian with his headdress of feathers. The whip-poor-will, calling to
his mate from the leafy glades, sounded to my excited imagination like
the whoop of the red man; and, lastly, when the Queen of Night rose
from her bed of cloud, I saw in the silver-fringed masses a perfect
group of De Soto and his warriors gazing down on that river which they
were the first to discover.</p>

<p>I could not better have timed my arrival at the flotilla off Fort
Pillow, for the very morning after my advent, while sitting at
breakfast, I was startled by a rapid cannonading all about me. Fort Pillow is round a bend in the river, some three miles below where we are lying, and beneath its guns the Confederate fleet usually lie for protection. Having been reinforced by some of their boats from New Orleans they had apparently determined on a desperate effort to disperse the Federal squadron, and as I rushed to the stern-gallery I

saw four of their vessels advancing with a full head of steam on, and

not firing a shot, though our boats as they slipped from their
moorings to meet them were banging away with their eleven inches
gloriously. The attention of the Southerners appeared to be at first
directed towards a mortar-boat which lay under the bank about a mile
below the rest of the Federal fleet, and their object was evidently to
sink or capture it before assistance could arrive. The Cincinnati,
however, succeeded in getting between them and their prey, upon which
two made directly for her and the others advanced up the stream
towards the Benton and Carondelet. We now for the first time perceived
they were constructed to act as rams, for the two first ran into the
Cincinnati at full speed, striking her as it so happened in her most
vulnerable part, and receiving the contents of her entire battery as
they did so. The Mound City had now reached the scene of action, and
was struck in turn by one of the Confederate vessels, but the effect
of her fire was so severe, as was also that of the Cincinnati, that
both of the rams hauled off in an apparently disabled condition, and
went twisting and turning with the current round the point, obscured
in a cloud of smoke. Tugs immediately laid hold of the two Federal
boats and towed them in a sinking state, from the crashing effect of
the iron prows, to shoal water. In the meantime, the rams that had
made for the Benton and Carondelet were met with a warm reception, one
of them getting her boilers exploded, which enveloped her in a veil of
steam, and the shrieks from those on board could be distinctly heard
in the intervals of firing; she drifted helplessly after her consorts,
while the other, in a riddled condition, struck her flag, and would
have been captured had not another boat taken her in tow and carried
her beneath the guns of the fort. All this time four Confederate
gun-boats stood off at a respectful distance, firing at long range and
ricocheting their shot all round our neighbourhood; but as soon as
their crippled consorts had placed the point between them and us,
thinking discretion the better pact of valour, they decided on
following them. In addition to the damage done to the Cincinnati and
Mound City, Captain Stembal, of the former vessel, was dangerously
wounded, one of the Masters killed, and some few of the crew of both
boats more or less hurt. A deserter from Fort Pillow, who has just
been taken on board the Commodore's vessel, reports the loss of the
Confederates in the action at one hundred and eight killed: doubtless
numbers must have lost their lives from scalding on the boat whose
boilers were exploded. The Secessionists apparently relied entirely
upon the effect of their rams, for though these had guns mounted in
embrazures of cotton-bales they made no use of them. This was probably
owing to the terrific fire at close quarters which the Federals kept
up, making it almost certain death to any one attempting to serve the
pieces, and some of their guns, with the protecting bales, were
knocked into a disordered heap. We are expecting daily to make an
attack upon the fort and try issues with the vessels that, to speak
the truth, so gallantly courted combat on the above occasion.</p>

<p>There is a lurking danger to which we are exposed, which is of that
treacherous and hidden nature that it is difficult to contend
successfully against it. Roving bands of guerrillas secrete themselves
amid the thick growth on the rising banks (where not flooded), and
every transport that passes down the river is a target for their
assassin rifles. Our pilot narrowly escaped being shot the other day
from the Arkansas shore. We were steaming along with the stream when
suddenly "Crack, crack, crack !" "Whiz, whiz, whiz! " made every one
jump to his feet. There was the puff of white smoke curling from the
trees, and though we made directly for the spot we were not in time to
retaliate, but caught a glimpse of the band of desperadoes as they
plunged back into the woods. I send you a sketch of these Jeff
Thompson heroes, who make no distinction between citizen and soldier,
but all alike fall victims to their murderous toils.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>Another great battle had been fought in front of Richmond, in
which the Confederates obtained a momentary success, to be succeeded
by another repulse. On Saturday, the 31st ult., after a terrific
thunder-storm, the Confederates made an attack on General Casey's
division, which was driven from the field, with the loss of his guns,
baggage-waggons, and military stores. Other divisions of the Federal
army arrived and drove back the enemy at the point of the bayonet. The
next morning (Sunday) the Confederates attempted to renew the
conflict, but were everywhere repulsed. General Casey's position was
not only regained, but a further advance made. Among the prisoners
taken by the Federals were General Pettigrew and Colonel
Loring. During the engagement Professor Lowe, in his balloon, was
hovering above the scene and communicating information by telegraph
over the wires as to the movements of the Confederates. The reports of
the Federal loss vary from 3800 to 7000. General Joseph Johnstone is
reported to have been seriously wounded, leaving the command of the
Confederates to General Gustavus Smith.</p>
<p> General Fremont has occupied Harrisonburg, in the valley of the Shenandoah. Beyond Harrisonburg he came upon General Jackson,
fell into an ambuscade, and suffered heavy loss. General Jackson was expected to make a stand at Fort Republic.</p>

<p>General Halleck reports from his head-quarters near Corinth that
General Pope, with 40,000 men, was nine miles south of Corinth, pushing the enemy hard. The latter had taken 10,000 prisoners and deserters and 15,000 stand of arms. The retreating force were throwing away their arms. Colonel Elliot had succeeded in reaching the Mobile and Ohio Railroad at Burnsville, where they destroyed the track, burned up the d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t and locomotives and a train of twenty-six cars loaded with supplies of every kind, destroyed 10,000 stand of arms, and much other material of war.</p>

<p>The Confederates had evacuated Fort Wright. A naval engagement
had taken place on the Mississippi, near Memphis, resulting in the destruction of the Confederate fleet. All the Confederate vessels were destroyed but one. Memphis surrendered immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Southern papers state that the Federal forces, 2000 strong, had
landed on James Island, opposite Charleston, under cover of a gun-boat,
and that some fighting had occurred, in which the Federals were
repulsed.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>The Federal Navy Department had ordered the construction of fifteen more gun-boats.</p>

<p>The Senate had passed the Tax Bill. Cotton had been taxed at half a cent per pound.</p>

<p>The bill punishing polygamy in Utah passed the Senate by 37 to 2

votes. The bill recognising the independence of Hayti and Liberia, and providing for diplomatic relations with those countries, was passed by the House by a vote of 86 against 37.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury, in a message sent to the Congress, states that the total debt of the Government on the 29th of May was 491,415,894 dols., and that the interest paid averaged only 4&#xB7;35 per cent.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, JUNE</hi> 21, 1862.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> thunderclouds of war had been nearing
each other too rapidly to leave it in doubt whether an explosion were
at hand or not. The metaphor might indeed have been suggested by the
physical conditions of the encounter. Taking advantage of a tremendous
storm, the Confederate General attacked on the last day of May, and
what General M'Clellan calls a "desperate" battle ensued. The advanced
guard of the Federals, under General Casey, was utterly routed, and
fled in a way which M'Clellan describes as unaccountable and
disorderly: nearly twenty of their guns were taken, and a great
slaughter was made. Then reinforcements were brought up by the Federal
leader, and the assailants were checked. They were not daunted,
however, for they renewed the attack on the next day, Sunday, but
without gaining any fresh advantage. They claim the victory on the
whole business, but it is, of course, violently clamoured for by the
North. The military honours are clearly with the Confederates, but it
seems doubtful whether they gain much more. As regards the
slaughter&#x2014;we say it without disrespect&#x2014;one knows not what to believe
when the American journals take to computation. Our readers will
recollect the "awful carnage" which has marked every action throughout
the war&#x2014;on paper. They were almost prepared to find the total account
something terrible. The returns appear to have at length been made up,
not from sensation paragraphs, but from the army rolls, and the whole
amount of lost, from Bull Bun to Banks's run, is 5791. Reading this,
we hardly like to believe that this last battle has cost the Federals
more than they have sacrificed during the year and a half of fighting;
and, when we set down the numbers said to be lost at 7000 killed and
wounded&#x2014;so speaks the latest telegram&#x2014;we do so subject to the
revision of the bill by the Federal General. The latter states that
the losses on the Confederate side "must have been" enormous, but we
shall await General Johnson's account. Be the figures large or small,
the battle does not seem to bring the war any nearer a termination,
but, on the contrary, it shows that the Confederates are not only very
strong but very resolved. It may be presumed that another engagement
must have occurred almost under Richmond, and the fate of the
Virginian capital may by this time be decided. The mails also speak of
an engagement on the Mississippi, of the destruction of Confederate
vessels, and the surrender of Memphis; and also of a report that the Southern defences on the James River had been passed. If this latter report be true, the advantage to General M'Clellan is, of course, very great. Lastly, we hear that "the magnificent Fremont" had fallen into an ambuscade planned for him by General Jackson, and that "the Pathfinder who always lost his way," had suffered severely. More gun-boats were ordered, and the Senate had passed the Tax Bill. The New York papers continue to be outrageously angry at the idea of even France presuming to mediate, and the hint that the Orleans Princes have deserved well of the Union is repeated with additional offensiveness. Doubtless, there will be fresh exultation in the North at the bad news from Mexico.</p>

<p>Connected with the American question is the only business of much interest which has occupied the attention of our own Parliament. In both Houses Ministers have been invited to express their sentiments on the subject of the atrocious proclamation by which General Butler (an ex-attorney) hounds on the Rowdies in his ranks to outrage upon the ladies of New Orleans. Both Lord Russell and Lord Palmerston spoke as Englishmen must speak of such brutality; and their language implies, and was of course meant to imply, that no Government that should not disavow and punish the author of so ruffianly an appeal to the worst feelings of the worst class of men could retain the respect of civilised nations. We sincerely trust to hear that Butler has been superseded ; but certain laboured attempts which have been made to explain away some of the wickedness of his ferocious edict do not seem to point in the desirable direction. At present a Northern General is branded with the guilt of inciting worse acts than were ever perpetrated in the name of "Liberty" during the Reign of Terror; but let us hope that the brand may not also remain affixed upon those who can as yet atone to humanity by casting away the wretched creature himself.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Bohemian and City of New York we have news to the 14th inst.</p>

<p rend="center">BELLIGERENT OPERATIONS.</p>

<p>The state of the weather and the roads has prohibited any further
advance by General M'Clellan's army before Richmond. He reports his
loss at the late engagement, called Fair Oaks, as having been
890 killed, 3627 wounded, and 1222 missing, making a total of
5739. The Richmond <hi rend="italic">Despatch</hi> acknowledges a loss
at the same battle of at least 8000, including 5 generals, 23
colonels, 10 majors, and 57 captains killed or taken prisoners. It is
confirmed that General Joseph Johnston was among the wounded. The
command of the Confederate army has therefore devolved on General Lee,
whose address on taking the chief command informed his troops that
they had made their last retreat, and that henceforth every man's
watchword must be "Victory or death." President Davis had issued an
address to the army, thanking them for their bravery at the late
battle. The Governor of Virginia had ordered all stores in Richmond to
be closed daily at two<pb n="649"/> o'clock, to enable those in
business to devote a portion of each day for drill and discipline.</p>

<p>General Fremont's army had reached Harrisonburg and driven
Jackson's rear-guard from the town. General Fremont, in his official
despatches, claims to have achieved a decided victory over the
Confederates at Cross Keys. General Jackson had, however, made good
his retreat from the Valley of the Shenandoah, inflicting some loss on
the advance-guard of General Fremont's force. He hoped to join the
main army in Richmond.</p>

<p>The Federal General Mitchell had routed the Confederates at
Chattanooga, in East Tennessee, after two days' fighting. The East
Tennesseeans came out in crowds along the line of march and cheered
the Federalists.</p>

<p>We have no further intelligence of the progress of the attack on Charleston.</p>

<p>In the south-west, General Halleck reports that General Beauregard,
with the main body of the Confederate army of the south-west, had
retreated to Okolona, a station on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, about
forty miles south of Corinth. He had lost from 20,000 to 30,000 men by
death, capture, desertion, and other casualties. He still commanded a force of about 80,000 men.</p>

<p>The citizens of Memphis have submitted patiently to their fate. The
Federal Commander does not find it necessary to put the place under
martial law. Of the eight Confederate gun-boats which defended Memphis
four were captured, two were sunk, one burnt, and only one escaped by
superior speed. Much cotton had been destroyed by its owners along the
river banks, to which the Federals have now gained access.</p>

 <p>General Butler had arrested ex-Senator Pierre Soul&#xE9; in New Orleans
on a political charge, and intended sending him to the North.</p>

<p rend="center">WASHINGTON.</p>

<p>Secretary Welles had sent to the Naval Committees of Congress a

long communication calling renewed attention to the subject of iron-plated ships and the necessity of providing for the construction of them in lieu of wooden vessels. He only asks for an appropriation of one or two millions of dollars for this purpose.</p>

<p>The Danish Government has made a proposition to the Federal Government to take a few thousand fugitive negroes off their hands and remove them to the Island Saint Croix free of charge. After an apprenticeship of three years with regular wages, the negroes would receive their freedom. Mr. Seward replied that he had no authority to accept the proposition, but he would lay it before Congress.</p>

<p>Secretary Chase, in a letter to the Committee on Ways and Means,

asks authority to issue another 150,000,000 dols. in demand notes of not less denomination than five dols. each. The committee have reported a bill to this effect.</p>

<p>General Prim and Staff had been visiting the head-quarters of General M'Clellan near Richmond.</p>

<p>Lord Lyons had an interview with the President on the 13th, being on the eve of his departure for Europe.</p>

<p>An interview had taken place between the members of the foreign
Legations and Mr. Seward on the question of the specie seized by
General Butler at the Dutch Consul's residence in New
Orleans. Mr. Seward has dispatched a commissioner from the State
Department for the purpose of taking the necessary proofs for final
consideration.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>A missionary from New York, Mr. Collier, having opened schools

for coloured people of all ages at Newbern was ordered to close them by Governor Stanly, the newly-appointed Unionist Governor of North Carolina. Mr. Collier resigned his situation, and laid his grievances before the New York public. The press throughout the North espoused his cause. President Lincoln, on being called upon to act, reversed the decision of Governor Stanly, and the coloured schools will be reopened.</p>

<p>In the Missouri State Convention a bill proposing a scheme of
gradual emancipation was defeated by a vote of 52 against 19.</p>

<p>The export of large amounts of specie to Europe continues. The
demand for gold has raised it to 7 per cent premium above its paper
representative. This movement of specie is caused by the sale of
American securities, owned by Europeans, who are tempted by the
present high quotations in Wall-street to seize the opportunity for
selling out.</p></div2>

<p>"<hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> conflict more, the fiercest and the
last." This is what the American journals tell us to expect: its scene
to be near Richmond; but the last mails record no new movement of the
armies. General Jackson has, however, effected a masterly retreat over
the mountains in defiance of the hot pursuit of the Federals; and he
brings a very strong reinforcement to the Confederates at
Richmond. His defeat of Shields is fully admitted in official
despatches. "The men fought like demons," says an eyewitness. The
"magnificent" Fremont is once more in full activity, and is restored
to the good graces of the people. He claims a victory at Cross Keys,
where he counted five hundred Confederates slain. The fall of
Charleston is confidently predicted, the more confidently that the
Federals have established themselves in a neighbouring island. With
these not unimportant exceptions, we have not much to record in regard
to the fratricidal war....</p>

<p>Mr. Lindsay, upon the suggestion of high authority, postponed his
motion in favour of a recognition of the Southern States.</p></div2>
