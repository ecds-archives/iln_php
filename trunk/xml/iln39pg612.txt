<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> page 611 we give an Illustration of a torchlight procession at Washington by Blenker's Brigade to celebrate M'Clellan's promotion to the command of the Federal Army. The central figure on horseback is General Blenker. The <hi rend="italics">New York Tribune</hi> gives the following account of the Blenker procession:- "Three thousand Germans of General Blenker's division constituted a torchlight procession on Monday evening, November 11, and, with regimental bands and fireworks and coloured lights, marched to General M'Clellan's house to celebrate his promotion. Transparencies and pyrotechnic pieces of the most beautiful designs were added to the attraction. All Washington was out to see. The crowds soon demanded the American stimulus of a speech, and the calls for Secretaries Cameron and Seward brought them to the balcony. They briefly addressed the crowd. Calls were then made for General Blenker, who said :- 'Citizens and Sojers,-I will say a few words, and it shall be few. If ever I find the enemy I will fight tousands, and tousands of us will fight better as I speak this noble English' (Immense cheering). Cries were made continually for General M'Clellan, but he merely appeared at different times upon the balcony, and bowed to the crowd of soldiers and civilians that filled the street from one side to the other. Within his house the General extemporised a generous collation, and gave a warm welcome to the officers who swarmed in to take him by the hand. The whole testimonial was a splendid success, and is due entirely to the spirit and liberality of General Blenker and his staff."</p>

<p>The special correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> at Washington writes as follows respecting this demonstration:-"The prettiest sight I have seen since I crossed the Atlantic was the torchlight procession got up by General Blenker and his Germans in honour of Major-General M'Clellan on his promotion to the command of the Army. It was something like a Burschen procession, but it exceeded very much any displays of the kind in the number of torchbearers and the variety of colour and effect. The camp of the Blenker men-famous for lager beer and quaint pipes, also for perverted notions respecting the <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> of Unionists and the <hi rend="italic">tuum</hi> of Secessionists-lies some miles across the Potomac, in the valleys and dells of the 'old dominion,' which is nearly as old as Canada,and is meeting with very rude treatment in its primitive antiquity. From it they came in a grand procession, with bands playing and rough chorus-singing, and filed over the Longbridge in a dancing stream of fire-blue, green, red, yellow, orange, and dazzling white. The air was still, the night fine, and nothing could have been more successful than the fireworks in their way, or the impression produced by the stream crested with fire, which first glowed like a torrent of lava, then gradually broke its particles into a broad ribbon of nebulous flames, which, coming nearer, was resolved into balls of diverse-coloured light, and, thus winding on, thinned away into a narrow stripe of orange-like molten iron running through the black courses of the mould. The 'Dutchmen' pursued their career by Pennsylvania-avenue, past the State Department, and, turning in at the gates of the White House, treated the President to a sight of the demonstration intended for his benefit."</p>

<p>O<hi rend="smallcaps">N</hi> the retirement of General Scott, on the 31st of last October, General M'Clellan was formally declared Commander-in-Chief of the Federal forces, of which he had been for some time the actual head. George M'Clellan was born at Philadelphia in December, 1826, and destined for the military service. In his sixteenth year he was sent to West Point, and left it in 1846, as Second Lieutenant in the Engineers, to take part in the Mexican War. His bravery in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco gained him promotion, and at the storming of the forts of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec his conduct was so brilliant that it gained him his captaincy. After the peace he was appointed a teacher at West Point, where he wrote a manual of the art of war, which is highly esteemed by American soldiers. After this he built Fort Delaware, and then was ordered to Texas and New Mexico to make a topographic survey of the district through which the Pacific Railway was to run. This difficult task was interrupted by a summons to Washington, where the military department had selected him, in conjunction with Major Mordecai and Captain Delafield, to go and witness the operations in the Crimea, which excited as great interest in America as they did in Europe. As there was no prospect of active service on his return home, M'Clellan determined to leave the army, and accepted the post of technical director to the Illinois Central Railway, which he held for several years with credit. In this position the outbreak of the civil war surprised him, and, as he was universally respected and known in the West, he was at once called to a high post. The Governor of Ohio appointed him Major-General and chief of the militia of that State ; but by the recommendation of General Scott he was made Major-General of the regular Army, and intrusted with a most important command in Western Virginia. After the defeat of the Federal army at Bull Run, M'Clellan was summoned to Washington to take supreme command. A Washington letter describes the enthusiasm felt by his men for General M'Clellan:- "General M'Clellan (it states) is one of the least pretentious of men; he generally wears the simple blouse of the rifleman, with not even the starred shoulder-straps to denote his rank; a man who never wastes time-who is indefatigable in his pursuit and attack of the enemy, and equally untiring in his efforts to secure the utmost comfort of his men compatible with the circumstances of a soldier's life. When his line is on the march he is ever among the men, with a kind and cheering word for every company-a pleasant look, or kind salute, or hearty grasp of the hand for every officer or private with whom he is brought on speaking terms by business; and in a fight he is always at the front of the column, in the thickest of the danger, encouraging his soldiers by cheering word and fearless deed. He takes soldier's fare with the rest, asking no better food, and no more luxurious bed than the newest-recruited private under his command. If he sees a man without proper shoes or clothing he has that man with his Captain sent to his own quarters, where the man is served with the garments he needs and the Captain receives a reprimand that leads him to look more closely after the comfort of his men in future."</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the Bohemian, from Portland, we have New York telegrams to the 7th inst. Congress assembled on the 2nd, and immediately passed resolutions thanking Captain Wilks for his arrest of the "traitors" Slidell and Mason. Resolutions were also voted which requested the President to confine these two gentlemen in the cells of convicted felons until Colonels Corcoran and Wood should be treated as prisoners of war. Mr. Eliot, of Massachusetts, offered a series of resolutions declaring that the war is waged simply for the re-establishment of the Union, but insisting upon the right of the President to emancipate all persons held as slaves in any militay district in a state of insurrcetion, and advising such a course. The House refused to veto the resolution-by seventy against fifty-six-but its consideration was postponed for a week. In the Senate Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, gave notice of a bill to confiscate the property of rebels and to give freedom to persons in the Slave States. On the second day the President's Message was received and read, and the reports of the several Departments of State were handed in to the Senate and house of Representatives, except that of the Secretary of the Treasury, which would not be ready for a few days. Subsequently, Messrs. Breckinridge and Burnett, of Kentucky, were expelled from Congress; and a committee had been appointed by the House to inquire into the expediency of abolishing slavery in the district of Columbia.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT'S MESSACE.</p>

<p>After congratulating the country on its abundant harvests, the President refers to the foreign relations of the Republic in these terms:-</p>
<p>You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times, our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude, chiefy turning upon our own domestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factions domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect abroad, and one party, if not both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them.</p>

<p>The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, discarding all moral, social, said treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including especially the acquisition of cotton, those nations appear as yet not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the destruction than through the preservation of the Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite sure a second argument could be made to show them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it.</p>

<p>The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, to the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improbably saw from the first that it was the Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation produces more durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable, and reliable commerce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign States, because, whatever might be their wishes or dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of our Government mainly depends, not upon them, but on the loyalty, virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign Powers, averting causes of irritation, and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honour. Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defences on every side, while, under this general recommendation, provision for defending our coast line readily occurs to the mind. I also, in the same connection, ask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortications and d&eacute:p&ocirc:ts of arms and munitions, with harbour and navigation improvements at well-selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defence and preservation.</p>

<p>The President preserves a judicious silence on the affair of the Trent and San Jacinto.</p>

<p>On the vital subject of emancipation by the right of war, he uses the following guarded yet significant language:-</p>

<p>In considering the policy to be adopted for suppressing the insurrection I have been anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it proper to keep the integrity of the union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the last Session for closing those ports. So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence as well as the obligations of law, instead of transcending I have adhered to the Act of Congress to confiscate property, and for insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed its propriety will be duly considered. The Union must be preserved, and hence all indispensable means must be employed. We should not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are indispensable.</p>

<p>The appropriations for the service of the next fiscal year are computed for a force of 500,000 men. He says he has a surplus of cavalry, and will reduce that expensive arm of the service. Although Congress only authorised a levy of 500,000, the Secretary could have raised 1,0OO,0OO of men as easily as not. The rapidity with which the Army, which in April amounted to 16,000 regulars, developed into a force of 640,000 surpasses anything of the sort exhibited by France when her destinies were in the hands of Napoleon. He has no doubt that, in case of emergency, the United States could send into the field a force of 3,000,000 of armed men. "The effort to restore the Union" is termed "the most gigantic endeavour in the history of civil war." The check of Bull Run gave no discouragement, and merely postponed the campaign for a few months. The possession of Western Virginia, and the occupation of Hatteras and Beaufort have, moreover, already redeemed "our transient reverses." Mr. Cameron alludes to the urgent need which the army had of a supply of improved firearms. The resources of the United States' armoury at Springfield being quite inadequate to the occasion, contracts were made with private establishments, and a special agent was sent to Europe to purchase 2,000,000 dols. worth. The Government ought to have in store never less than a million of muskets, and a corresponding proportion of arms and equipments for cavalry and artillery. On the subject of the coast defences he says:-</p>

<p>It is of grest importance that immediate attention should be given to the condition of our fortifications upon the seaboard and the lakes, and upon our exposed frontiers. They should at once be placed in perfect condition for successful defence. Aggressions are seldom made upon a nation ever ready to defend its honour and to repel insults; and we should show to the world that, while engaged in quelling disturbances at home, we are able to protect ourselves againat attacks from abroad.</p>

<p>He recommends that the accommodations at the celebrated Military Academy at West Point, which now contains only 192 cadets, be enlarged so as to allow of the education of 500 trained officers. He suggests that the distinction between regulars and volunteers should be abolished. He admits that recruiting for the regular army has been a failure. He demands that another line of railroad be constructed from Baltimore to Washington, as absolutely necessary for the supply of the troops in the event of the Potomac being closed by ice or a blockade. The paragraphs favourable to the arming of the slaves are printed in some of the New York journals, although they were stricken out by Mr. Lincoln himself, after Mr. Cameron had refused to expunge them with his own hand.</p>

<p rend="center">REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.</p>

<p>Secretary Welles reports that the navy was called upon to blockade a coast line of nearly 3000 miles to keep the navigation of the Potomac open, to organise combined military and naval expeditions against points of the Southern coast, and to pursue the privateers. When the vessels now building and purchased of every class are armed, equipped, and ready for service the condition of the navy will be as follows:-

<p>Mr. Blair announces that he has accepted the offer made in 1857 by Great Britain for a reduction of the international rate between the two countries on letters from 1s. to 6d., which, however, has not yet gone into operation, as it awaits the response of the British office.

<p rend="center"> <hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, DECEMBER</hi> 21, 1861.</p>

<p>L<hi rend="smallcaps">AST</hi> week it seemed difficult to obtain attention for any subject save that of the American crisis. "Who can tell what a day may bring forth?" To-day, in the presence of the heavy affliction with which it has pleased the Almighty and Inscrutable to visit our beloved Sovereign and the nation, even the solemn situation in which we have been placed by the piratical act of the Americans is momentarily disregarded while we seek to realise the sudden sorrow. But the record of the week must be duly completed.</p>

<p>President Lincoln's Message, as a composition, is conceived in the same low moral tone and executed with the same maladroitness which have characterised the preceding State Papers of his Government. But such considerations are of small importance compared with the indications of policy afforded by the document. There is no mention of the Trent outrage. From this circumstance, and from a meaningless declaration that the president does not desire hostilities with England, some sanguine writers have hastened to assume that the act of Captain Wilks will be disavowed, and the Southern Commissioners handed over to us. It is urged that Mr. Lincoln did not deem the act of the American Captain as worthy of notice in the Message, or that it is one upon which England has but to express her feeling to obtain immediate atonement. And this view is supported by reference to the fact that an actual wrong to British subjects is mentioned, and Congress is recommended to make compensation. We should be too happy to believe that so wise a course was that designed for adoption by the American Government, but we are afraid to resign ourselves to so agreeable a hope. It contradicts the general expression of that part of the American public which makes itself heard, and which exercises a fatal control over the so-called government of the American press (with one or two honourable exceptions), and of the American Secretary of State. The House of Representatives has deliberately offered a vote of thanks to the pirate Wilks; and though it is technically true that this is not precisely the same thing as a vote of our House of Commons, it is equally true, and more to the purpose, that the House of Representatives expresses the sentiments of those who, to the disgrace of the higher classes in the States, are permitted to engross political power. In the face of all these demonstrations, to say nothing of an official utterance by the head of the Federal Navy, we dare scarcely believe that the despatch of Earl Russell will receive the only answer which we can accept. Still we have only to wait and hear. Our next Impression will, in all probability, contain the expected intelligence. The news regarding the struggle between the North and South merely states that General M'Clellan has not moved, "nor will he move until he is certain to win "-a somewhat indefinite date. We learn with something akin to disgust that the barbarous reprisal system is likely to come into effect, that prisoners are being cruelly treated, and may be actually executed in cold blood-facts which reduce a war to an abominable brigandage. The North, in its excess of zeal for civilisation, is also elaborately destroying harbours in the South, thus by savage acts giving the lie to the profession of belief that the territory to which the harbours belong will ever again be a portion of the Federal dominions.</p>

Two line-of-battle ships, the Algiers, 89, and the Queen, 80, and a gun-boat, the Alacrity, 4, have already left; and two other liners, the Agamemnon, 91, and the James Watt, 91, and another gun-boat, the Foxhound, 4, will leave for the same destination as soon as they are ready for sea, probably about Saturday next. The sloop Firebrand, 6, which arrived here on the 8th from Gibraltar, was ordered back again immediately, and left on the 9th. Two frigates, the Amphion, 36, from Messina, and the Liffey, 51, from Corfu, have been likewise ordered off by telegraph for the Straits. It is reported that the naval force now assembling there in such haste will be still further augmented by some of the ships from the coast of Syria.</p>

<p>B<hi rend="smallcaps">Y</hi> the arrival of the City of Baltimore we have telegrams from New York to the evening of the 13th inst. Congress has not done anything of importance except to pass a resolution in favour of the adoption of measures for an exchange of prisoners. The President has refused for the present to furnish that body with the correspondence between the Federal Government and foreign Powers relative to the European intervention in Mexico.</p>

<p rend="center">MR. SEWARD'S DIPLOMACY.</p>

<p>A mass of correspondence between Mr. Seward and the American Ministers in Europe has been presented to Congress. The matters treated of relate to the concession of belligerent rights to the Confederate States, at which Mr. Seward is highly offended, and to the adhesion of the United States to the Declaration of the Congress of Paris relative to maritime rights, an adhesion which Great Britain and France would only receive without prejudice to the rights of the seceded States, and which was therefore withdrawn by the United States. The dispatch of reinforcements to Canada was also complained of, but justified on the ground of the distrust of the United States' Government entertained by that of Great Britain and of the vague menaces uttered by Mr. Seward.</p>

<p rend="center">THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 0F THE TREASURY.</p>

<p>Mr. Chase in July estimated the expenditure of the current fiscal year (July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1862) at 318,520,000 dollars; but, in consequence of the increased number of men levied for the army, his amended estimate is raised to 532,520,000 dollars. Of this aggregate he has already raised by loans the sum of 197,243,000 dollars. The revenue, which he had estimated would produce 80,000,000 dollars, had, partly owing to Congress refusing to pass measures he had recommended, and partly owing to the depression of trade, so fallen off that he only expected to receive 54,500,000 dollars from it. For the purpose of filling up the deficit, the Secretary recommends the confiscation of the property of rebels, whether found in the loyal or disloyal States, but his main reliance is on loans and taxation. He recommends that the duty on brown sugar should be increased to 2&fract12:  cents per pound, on clayed sugar 3 cents, on green tea to 20 cents, and on coffee to 5 cents. He further recommends that the direct tax be increased, so as to produce 20,000,000 dollars from the loyal States alone, and not only their proportion of the same, on the fiction that all the States were loyal. He has a plan of excise and stamp taxes. He proposes duties on stills and distilled liquors, on tobacco, bank-notes, on carriages, legacies, evidences of debt, and instruments for the conveyance of property and other like subjects, such as will produce 20,000,000 dols. more. From the 3 per cent income tax he hopes to procure ten millions more. The whole direct and indirect taxes will thus produce 90,000,000 dols. This sum is small compared with the aggregate property and annual earnings of the people.</p>

<p>The Secretary's great resource lies in supplanting the banks. Their circulation in the loyal States and Western Virginia amounts to about 150,000,000 dols. He argues that this currency is a loan from the people to the banks, costing the latter nothing but the expense of issue and redemption and the interest on the specie kept in hand. These advantages ought to be transferred from the stockholders of the banks to the national Government. He claims to find authority in the United States' Constitution for this measure, under the powers to regulate commerce and the value of coin. His method of issue is to hand this national currency to the banks, who shall secure their redemption by pledge of United States' stocks and an adequate provision of specie. The people will thus have a uniform currency and the Government enjoy the advantages of a loan without interest. The competition of local bank-notes is to be annihilated by a special tax. He estimates the specie now in the United States at 275,000,000 dols. Existing Acts of Congress enable the Secretary to raise 75,000,000 dols. more than he has yet raised on bonds and Treasury notes payable on demand, and 50,000,000 dols. more must be raised by another loan.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year 1863 no reliable estimates can be made. The Secretary hopes that the present war will be over before midsummer; but in order to be prepared for all eventualities he submits estimates based on the hypothesis that the war will continue. These estimates (including 43,000,000 dols. as interest on debt) amount to 475,331,000 dols., of which 95,800,000 may be raised by revenue, leaving a balance to be provided for of 379,531,000 dols. On July 1,1862 the Public Debt will be 517,373,000 dols., and on the above hypothesis 897,373,000 dols, on July 1,l863. He thinks the loyal States alone could pay off this latter sum in thirty years. Of the 72,000,000 dols. worth of bullion deposited in the United States' Mint in 1861, 37,000,000 dollars came from Europe. The Secretary closes his report by recommending the adoption of an international decimal system of weights, measures, and coins.</p>

The connection between Formica viatica and Atta cephalotes is very remarkable. M. Roussel informed Dr. Nylander that both species are common in Algeria, live in numerous societies, and construct their formicaria usually in bank, frequently at roadsides. Fierce conflicts take place occasionally between the Formica and Att&aelig:, the former being always victorious, carrying off numbers of Att&aelig: captive, become henceforth nurse-slaves of Formica viatica. Mr. Bates, who has resided several years in Brazil, states that he not only observed the slave-making ants carrying off pup&aelig: from the nests of more peaceable communities, but also witnessed the slaughter of the more defenceless species. M. Roussel observed Atta cephalotes in great numbers living in perfect harmony in the nests of Formica viatica.</p>

<P>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> attention of the Canadian people at the present juncture (says the <hi rend="italic">Halifax Reporter</hi>) is wisely directed to the all-important question of "national defences." There appears to be a prevalent impression, which is rapidly gaining ground among all classes of people, that they must take immediate measures to provide for the security of the province in case of a sudden invasion from across the borders. The unsatisfactory state of relations between England and the United States brings home forcibly to every intelligent man the necessity of preparing for any emergency. According to late Canadian papers, the military authorities are making their preparations slowly and surely; but still it is obvious that, unless the people themselves afford united assistance, Canada, the upper province especially, would in case of war be in a most perilous position. In Quebec, and other parts of Lower Canada, there are fortifications of an impregnable character; but in Western Canada, with the exception of Kingston, we believe there are none of any importance or strength. The cities of Toronto, Hamilton, London, and the towns of Niagara, Windsor (opposite Detroit), and a hundred other places, would be in most imminent danger if a war were to break out suddenly- during the winter or spring, for instance. All the fighting, in fact, in Upper Canada would have to be done in the open field or behind hastily-constructed batteries and earthworks. The importance, then, of forming a volunteer organisation all through the country is becoming a matter which cannot be disputed by any man of foresight who values the safety of the province. Already there is a general movement made to establish volunteer companies and we are told that "there is every reason to believe that much will be done to place the militia forces of the country on a better footing than they are at present, and thus to make this arm of the service perfectly reliable in case of emergency." The militia, we may mention, in Canada, as well as in all the provinces, is almost a nonentity-little else than an undisciplined mob; and, unless steps are taken to drill and discipline it, it would be useless in the field. This fact is being generally recognised on all sides, and the prospect is that there will soon be a change some way for the better. In Montreal a general calling out of the provincial militia for drill during the winter is spoken of. In Toronto the <hi rend="smallcaps">Leader</hi> is urging upon the officers of the sedentary militia the propriety of resigning their commissions or else taking immediate steps to become acquainted with their drill, and in many places all over the province it is said there is a desire among the sedentary officers to join with the active volunteers in order to learn their drill. Still, the impression amongst men of good judgment and discernment is that there is little reliance to be pleased on the militia, and that the best and surest mode of providing for the defence of the province is to form a volunteer regiment in every locality.</p>

<p>In Halifax (says the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reporter</hi>) the old militia law has entirely gone out of practice and given place to the volunteer system. Nowhere in the British provinces, indeed, have the young men responded more heartily to the call to form themselves into corps for defence than in Nova Scotia; and few, if any, of the colonies can present an equal number of well-drilled and organised companies. Still, however, gratifying as has been the success that has attended the laudable efforts of the promoters of the volunteer movement, a great deal more might be done in the way of increasing the number of the forces all over the country. Both the Lieutenant-Governor and General Doyle, on the occasion of the recent volunteer inspection, very properly made some observations on the importance of obtaining additional strength to the volunteer ranks; and it is to be hoped that their advice will have some effect with the large numbers of young men who have as yet, all over the province, kept aloof from the movement. Very lately, in Bridgetown and Picton, an effort has been made, and successfully too, to form a volunteer company in each of these places: and it would be satisfactory and encouraging to see a similar spirit evinced in every town and village throughout this province. Let this be done, and we would soon, like the mother country, be in a position to present a body of "living walls" that could successfully repel any force that might invade our shores.</p>

<p>At the present moment perhaps no subject is of so much interest and importance as the facilities for the transport of troops over from Halifax to Quebec. The following statement, derived from a gentleman who has recently travelled through New Brunswick, from Quebec to Halifax, will be found interesting:-" On disembarking at Halifax the troops can be conveyed by rail to Windsor, Nova Scotia, about sixty miles, from which point they can take steamers across the Bay of Fundy (which, contrary to popular ideas, is never frozen over) to St. Stephen's, a distance of about 170 miles. From St. Stephen's, a small town of about 4000 inhabitants, there is a railway open to Canterbury, twelve miles from Woodstock, one of the largest towns in New Brunswick. From Canterbury to Woodstock the distance can either be marched over a good snow road or performed in sleighs. From Woodstock a day's journey will convey the troops to Great Falls, a distance of 12 miles, over excellent roads. From Great Falls the next stage is to Lake Port, a small place on the Temiscouta, and thence by sleigh over a very good new military road (which is kept open by the mail track three times a week, and by the operations of the lumberers), they will arrive at the Rivi&eacute:re du Loup. Forty-two miles of this latter portion of the journey, and during which the only practical inconvenience that will be experienced is through a forest district called the Portage, involving an ascent of upwards of 1000 feet. At all the points named the troops could be supplied with refreshments and lodgings in the houses, barns, and outbuildings. The only scarcity with regard to provisions is in the article or flour, as very little grain is grown in the district over which this route passes. There is, however, abundance of beef and other provisions. From the Rivi&eacute:re du Loup the troops will be conveyed by railway, a distance of 115 miles, to Quebec."</p>

<p>Accounts from Kingston, Canada, of the 6th inst., denote much activity in military and warlike preparations. General Sir Fenwick Willliams, accompanied by Lieutenant-Colonel Robertson, Royal Engineers, and the members of the Staff, had made a thorough inspection of the facilities for fortifying Toronto. Guns of heavy calibre were to be placed along the margin of the bay in the vicinity of the Nadaud Old Forts. Workmen were immediately to commence repairing the blockhouse. The men of the 30th Regiment were busily employed in the use of heavy guns. A party of engineers, Sappers and Miners, had gone to Quebec, and a number of them would immediately be dispatched westward. Mr. S. Cunard had gone to Quebec at the request of the Canadian Government. The 62nd and another regiment were to be sent to this province; and it was thought some arrangement was likely to be effected with the Cunard Company to bring up these troops at least as far as Rivi&eacute:re du Loup before the close of the navigation.</p>
