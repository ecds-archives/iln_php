<p rend="center">PERSONAL.</p>

<p>General Wool, commanding at Fortress Monroe, has resigned.</p>
<p>General Havelock, of the British Army, and brother of the hero of Lucknow, had arrived in the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Edwin James, late M.P. and Q.C., had declared his intention to become an American citizen, and applied for admission to the New York bar.</p>
<p>The many European friends of Mr. Paul Morphy (whose home is in New Orleans) will be glad to learn that he had recently paid a visit to Richmond, and was then in perfect health.</p>

<p rend="center">MISCELLANEOUS.</p>

<p>Judge Grier, of Philadelphia, while presiding at the trial of a privateersman, said it was a farce to try this class of prisoners while the war endured. "The dictates of humanity would counsel the Government to treat captives on the sea the same as those taken on land, and he could not understand the policy of hanging the first and holding the latter as prisoners or releasing them. Let the rebellion be crushed and then men might be tried for treason or piracy, and he would assist." No sentence has yet been passed on the prisoners already brought in guilty of the crime of piracy.</p>
<p>The elections in the States of Massachusetts and New York had resulted in the defeat of the Democratic party and the overwhelming triumph of the united Republican and Union party, pledged to support President Lincoln in his war policy.</p>
<p>The exodus of free coloured emigrants from Canada and the Northern States to Hayti, by way of Boston and New York, continues.</p>
<p>The ship Maritana, of Providence, bound from Liverpool to Boston, struck on Egg Rocks, near Boston Light, and went to pieces. The captain, mate, and twenty-five of the passengers were drowned.</p>

<p rend="center">COMMERCIAL.</p>

<p>The imports at the port of New York show a decrease of almost one half compared with those of 1859, while the exports of domestic produce and general merchandise are almost double the exports of the same period in 1859.</p>
<p>The annual yield of time newly-opened silver-mines of California is estimated at the value of &pound:1,200,000.</p>

<p>P<hi rend="smallcaps">REVIOUS</hi> Numbers of this Journal have contained some particulars of the unsuccessful attempt of Stone's and Bank's columns to effect a landing on the 21st ult, on the Virginian Shore of the Upper Potomac, near Leesburg; and we now give two Illustrations, from Sketches by our Special Artist, in connection with this seemingly mad enterprise on the part of the Federal forces. The whole affair appears to have been ill-planned and adds another to the grievous blunders committed by the Federal commanders. It is hardly credible that 1800 men should have been sent across a river in the face of an enemy most strongly posted, and left unsupported when 30,000 of the division to which they belonged were within sound of their rifles. The small body, however, fought gallantly throughout the day against three times their number. One incident of the fight-a desperate effort made by the 15th Massachusetts Regiment to clear the woods by a bayonet charge-is Illustrated on our first page. This is believed to be the only instance in which a bayonet charge has been attempted by a regiment in the Federal army. The 15th Massachusetts fought most gallantly throughout the whole affair, although they knew the odds to be greatly against them; and the example set by their officers, mostly students from Harvard College, Cambridge, was most praiseworthy. Their efforts, however, were not crowned with success, as the deadly fire of the Mississippi riflemen drove them back each time; and, as evening drew on, seeing the utter uselessness of contending against their powerful enemy, the few surviving combatants slowly fell back to the river-side with but two line officers remaining. In the endeavour to recross to the island, midway between the Maryland and Virginian shoress, from which they had started, the general organisation of the force was quite abandoned, each company acting separately. The officers and men who could swim started, half naked, over the river, and the boats were kept awhile for the wounded. This, however lasted but a little time. All order was quickly lost. A large flat boat was sunk by overcrowding, and scores of men perished, some by drowning and some by the fire of the Confederates, who now crowded the high bank and poured an incessant fire upon the scattering fugitives. The river channel was thickly strewed with the dead and dying, but the bearing of the survivors is reported to have been strangely quiet-the immobility, perhaps of desperate hopelessness. Hundreds, probably, were here sacrificed. This much is certain, that out of the 1800 who landed scarcely 600 returned. The retreat of the Federalists forms the subject of the accompanying Engraving.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER</hi> 23, 1861.</p>

<p>T<hi redn="smallcaps">HE</hi> fearful storms which have raged on the eastern coast of North America have acquired a strange and almost ghastly interest for the North and South. The magnificently-described Armada that had sailed to deal the accumulated vengeance of the Federalists upon the Confederates had, it was thought, steered into the very heart of the tempest. The most opposite passions were aroused, and while the Northerners were praying that the armament to which the honour of the Union had been so solemnly confided might escape the fury of the elements the fiercer prayers of the South went up for its destruction- a result which the terrible character of the storms made painfully probable. We are told that it is almost certain that the fleet has been preserved; and we may hear at once that it has not only been saved, but has delivered its blow at Charleston or elsewhere. Meantime affairs on land have assumed a perplexing, not to say menacing, character. It was finally decided to remove General Fremont from his command, and the order came suddenly down to his camp, together with the journals which made the fact public. A mutiny of the gravest kind instantly showed itself. We say of the gravest kind, because the principal actors were not from the rank and file, but were officers, whose first duty was subordination, and who set the fatal example of declaring that they would not serve except under the General whose somewhat melodramatic faults seem to have endeared him to the forces lately under his command. General Fremont himself had to appeal to their sense of duty to the Republic; and it would appear that a sullen acquiescence was obtained, and that they will condescend to fight under the new leader appointed by the authorities. This may all augur ill for operations in that quarter. An American writer who has been narrowly inspecting the army of the North draws so unfavourable a picture of its discipline, cleanliness, and soldierly bearing as makes the English reports appear almost complimentary. But, in the face of all, Secretary Cameron announces to the nation that the day of reverses is over, and that the Union is now about to proceed from triumph to triumph. More to the purpose, it is distinctly stated that not only is the abolition of Southern slavery entirety out of the plans of the North, but that slaves who may be used by the army of the Federalists shall, if they belong to loyal owners, be paid for just as if they had been mules or any other article required for the campaign. This may be regarded as a provisional olive-branch held out to smooth matters in the event of a Northern success making a compromise possible. The Abolition party are enraged beyond measure, and their demonstrations are formidable. Meantime the usual raving of the ribald press is launched against England; and we are told that ours is a "Puritan and blackleg Cabinet," that the <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi> is the accepted organ of the English Tories (which may be news to our contemporary), and that as soon as ever the war is over " such a train of disasters" shall be inflicted upon England as shall make her rue the day when she dared to say that ten millions of Americans were belligerents instead of rebels. It is impossible to believe that such rabid rant and utter nonsense can have weight with educated Americans; but why is it tolerated by authorities that have and use power to suppress a journal for only expressing a wish for peace?...</p>
<p>The Americans, who profess themselves so enchanted at the sympathies of the Czar, and who half menace us and France with a Russo-American crusade, will have some few sacrifices to make in the matter of civilisation when the proposed coalition takes place. They open private letters, imprison suspected persons, put down journals, and clamour for hanging spies, but they have not attained the point of tying up women and flogging them for Southern proclivities, though, if it be true, as stated, that "the ladies of the North are all for the Southrons," there is no saying what the New York press may not recommend as "vigour of action."</p>

<p>N<hi rend="smallcaps">EW</hi> A<hi rend="smallcaps">DELPHI</hi>.-The long-announced production or "The Octoroon," the new sensation drama by Mr. Boucicault, took place on Monday before a crowded audience which filled the house to the ceiling. The scene is in Louisiana, where the Octoroon, or "eighth blood," is not allowed by law to marry with a white person; and the interest of the plot is based on this circumstance. Zoe, the natural daughter of Judge Peyton, has been reared in luxury but not fully emancipated, and on the death of her father is exposed to the machinations of a rascally overseer, Jacob M'Closkey (Mr. Emery), who, having mismanaged the estate, has an interest in forcing on its sale, with the slaves belonging to it, that he may purchase Zoe, and subdue her to his unwelcome passion. George Peyton, the nephew of the Judge and heir to the property (Mr. Billington), seeks naturally to avoid the sale, and expects daily a remittance from Liverpool sufficient to satisfy all demands. M'Closkey takes measures to prevent the packet from reaching his hands in time, in consequence of which the slaves are sold. A slave auction accordingly forms the grand sensation scene of the drama, which is conducted with all the formalities accompanying such transactions in Southern America, and forms a most exciting tableau. M'Closkey outbids all intending purchasers for the fair Octoroon, and  becomes her possessor. But, in his attempt to retard the delivery of the letter to Peyton, he has incurred a guilt for which he is destined to punishment. He has murdered a negro lad who was in charge of the post-bag; and a picture of the act has been accidentally taken by a photographic machine which was being worked in the vicinity. He falls into the clutches of Lyncn law, and is confined on board a steamer pending his execution. To effect his escape he hurls a lantern among some tar-barrels, and thus causes an explosion. But an avenging Indian is on his track, and slays him on the grave of the poor negro whom he had murdered. And all might now be well, but that Zoe, ignorant of these facts, has taken poison in despair. The drama is placed on the stage with all the accessories that can conduce to a great and marked success, and is illustrated with local scenery of great beauty. The composition itself is distinguished by a lightness and elegance of touch which compensates for whatever is revolting in the action. The whole was capitally performed. Mr. Emery was remarkably impressive in M'Closkey, and Mr. Boucicault as tim Yankee overseer, who afterwards turns photographer, was characteristically made up, and sustained his part with great humour. Mrs. Boucicault, as the heroine, excited so much interest that the audience were scarcely reconciled to her failing a victim in order to point more effectually the moral of the drama. We certainly recognise no aesthetic necessity for such a d&Eacute:nouement, but rather the contrary, and think that the author would have found his account in a happier ending. Mr. Billington, as the hero, was pathetic and gentlemenly; and the other parts were well supported, particularly that of an old negro, by Mr. George Jamison, and that of the Indian, by Mr. Phillips. The female parts, also, were well filled by Mrs. Marston and Miss Latimer. Miss Clara Denvil, as the poor murdered negro-lad, acted with her usual grace and spirit The success of the piece was decided.</p>

It consisted of an iron cylinder, about six feet long, and two feet in diameter, and perfectly watertight. This is filled with 300lb. of gunpowder. It is attached by ropes six feet long to an empty hogshead, which supports it in the water, the side of the hogshead being exposed. An elastic tube is fitted watertight, and connects the interiors of the magazine ann barrel. Through this tube the fuse runs, which is lighted through an aperture in the exposed side of the hogshead, and which, burning down till it reaches the cylinder, explodes it. The fuse would burn two hours. After being lighted and set loose, it was intended to float with the tide till it reached a vessel, and there remain, finally exploding. It was a very uncertain arrangement. There were two of these machines fastened by a rope several hundred feet long but the other was lost. These photographs were taken by the photographer of the Ordnance Department at the Washington Navy-yard.</p>

Captain Nelson, of the Harvey Birch, reports having left havre on Saturday last, the 17th inst., bound for New York, in ballast. On the 19th inst., when in lat. 42 deg. 6 min. N., long. 9 deg. 52 min. W., she was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagrim, late of the United States' navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who at once ordered the captain and crew on board the steamer, allowing them to take a few of their effects and fresh provisions. Captain Peagrim then ordered the Harvey Birch to be fired, and laid alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge. Captain Nelson is just landed with his crew and officers, twenty-nine in all, and has immediattely placed himself in communication with Captain Britton, the United States' Consul at this port. The Nashville is still lying in the river, flying the Southern Confederate flag. Captain Nelson says that Commander Peagrim states he has no commission from the Southern Government as a war-steamer, and yet declares he is not a privateer. No Southern Commissioners have arrived by the Nashville. There are, however, on board a Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton appears to have some commission to execute, as he proceeds to London immediately. The Nashville has experienced very bad weather since running the blockade at Charleston. Her crew consists of English and Irish, who, after shipment, were compelled to sign other articles. The whole of the crew of the Harvey Birch, with the exception of Captain Nelson and his two officers, were placed in irons until arriving here. Captain Peagrim endeavoured to make Captain Nelson and his crew take an oath of allegiance to the Confederate Government. Captain Peagrim has communicated with Mr. Yancey."</p>

<p>I<hi rend="smallcaps">T</hi> has become a question whether there is any design in both or either of the contending parties in the States of America to obtain from Great Britain, in a certain sense involuntarily,that which would amount to a violation of neutrality. It is well known that there has been, and probably there still is, an irritability among the more sensitive spirits of the Federal States against England on account of the decided principles of non-intervention in this terrible quarrel which have been laid down by our statesmen and universally acquiesced in by our people. What was expected of this country in such a juncture of American affairs as now exists does not very clearly appear; but of the fact that dissatisfaction with the conduct of England prevails to a considerable extent in the Northern States there is no doubt. Of the feeling towards this country in the Southern States we have little or no knowledge; but there have been rumours, the effect of which is that the Confederates believe that, in our secret hearts, our leaning is to<pb n="535"> their Side, and that our sympathies are, so to speak, wrapped up in cotton. So much of our prosperity, and of the welfare of a large part of our population, is supposed, not without reason, to depend on our import of an article of which in our markets the South has hitherto enjoyed a practical monopoly, that it has been whispered that the Confederate leaders had determined not to allow the export of any cotton to this country under any circumstances, and even apart from the restriction of a blockade, in the hope that England would yield to a commercial pressure, which might easily be converted into a social disturbance, and take such steps as would in effect cause her to do something more than lean to the party of the Secessionists. It would scarcely be denied, even in America itself-certainly not in the Southern States-that even a show of partisanship on the part of England would throw a heavy weight into the scale against the party which she discountenanced; and, however any such idea may be disavowed, it is more than probable that either section would be glad to test the real feeling of this country and the absolute soundness of the neutrality which she professes. Circumstances have just occurred which, as we conceive, will tend to bring about a settlement of any doubts which may exist in regard to this question. Far be it from us to insinuate anything which can be construed into even a tendency to offence to either party in this unhappy contest, but we may be permitted to say that it has long been the boast of the Americans as a people that they are essentially what they call "smart;" and, among other additions to the language which is common to the Old and the New Country which they have succeeded in making is the word "dodge"-the significancy of which is admitted. Of course, the word could not exist unless that which it signifies also existed; and that its application should creep into the conduct of the public affairs of the States, Federal or Confederate, at a critical moment, and when a great object was at stake, would not be in the least surprising.</p>

<p>These remarks have been elicited by the fact that armed vessels, both of the Federal and Confederate States, have made their appearance at one of our principal ports, and have demanded that aid, in the shape of opportunities and facilities for refitting, which, by the permission of the Sovereign, any State is accustomed to afford to the war-vessels of all nations. In the cave of the Federal vessel, whatever may have been her objects or her destination, she bore with her no distinctive marks of those qualities which would have brought her within the terms of the declaration of neutrality which has been solemnly enuticiated to the contending parties in America by the Government of this country. In that declaration it is laid down that her Majesty and all her subjects will "hold a strict and impartial neutrality between the Government of the United States of America and certain States styling themselves the Confederate States of America." The subjects of this realm are warned against adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties; and an interdict has been laid on the armed ships, and also the privateers of both parties, from carrying prizes made by them into the ports of the United Kingdom or of any of her Majesty's possessions. Sinning overtly against none of these provisions, the James Adger-Federalist-got what she required at Southampton, and in due time departed from that port, whither and for what immediate purposes we were bound by the letter of international law not too curiously to inquire. Hardly had the Federal flag disappeared from our waters when the Confederate colours floated in the same harbour, also over an armed ship, coming, avowedly, for the purpose of refitting. But here the parallel ceases. Without any attempt at disguise, but, as far as we can judge, with ostentatious frankness, it is made known by the commander of the Nashville that almost, if not entirely, in British waters, he had captured and burnt a trading vessel belonging to adherents of the Federal party, made prisoners of the crew, and brought them to England in irons; this latter course having been taken because they declined to enter the Confederate service.</p>
<p>So much of the well-known facts connected with the Nashville it has been necessary to state in order to justify the supposition which we venture to lay down, that the whole proceeding, from first to last, was carried on with the design of bringing to the test the question of British neutrality. It would seem as if this merchantman in ballast was taken and destroyed by a Confederate ship of war with the object of exhibiting the character of the latter openly before the eyes of the English Government, and coming, as it were, red-handed, from the destruction of a Federal vessel, she enters an English port, and asks aid and assistance in rendering her complete and efficient, and enabled to proceed on a cruise in which, of course she expects to meet with other vessels belonging to her enemies and to deal with them in the same manner as she treated the Harvey Birch. It is true that she brought no prize into a British port; but she brought with her all the symbols and signs of a prize. Indeed, she retains property on board of her belonging to the captain and passengers of the captured, for the recovery of which these latter have endeavoured to invoke the help of English law. Can it be denied that, if permission were given to the Nashville to refit and repair, it would be a violation of the spirit, if not of the letter-and even this distinction is by no means clear-of that part of the Queen's declaration which forbids "the adding to the warlike force of any ship or vessel of war or other armed vessel belonging to either of the contending parties?" No doubt the technical answer to this assertion is, that these words apply only to matters which are called contraband of war. But the real question is, how would such an act as the aiding and comforting-to use an old legal word- of this Confederate vessel, fresh from the capture of a Federal vessel, he construed by the authorities and the people of the North; and, if the truth were known, does not the Captain of the Nashville know that it would be construed in a hostile sense; and is not that the very reason why he has brought his ship, with the crew of her prize, into Southampton harbour?</p>

<p>Something might be said of the "prononc&eacute:" manner in which a Confederate agent who has come to England in the Nashville-of whom and of his mission we say nothing-has talked of the vast quantities of cotton which are lying ready for shipment in the Southern States, and which, of course, only await some contingency which would break up or render ineffective the Federal blockade. This matter, small in itself, is sufficiently suggestive, and is not without significance in arguing the view we have taken in reference to this transaction.</p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that we are discussing this question, not in any spirit of partisanship or with any tendency of feeling or opinion towards either party in the United States, but solely, as it stands, as a matter for the exercise of the discretion of the Government of this country in carrying out that principle of neutrality which has been laid down as our rule of action. In that sense, and considering the question only from that point of view in coming to a conclusion, it seems to us that the observance of pure and unadulterated neutrality demands that no assistance should be given to the Nashville. Admitting that all which we have suggested of a crafty device having been adopted in order to embroil this country with the Federal Government to be without foundation, and indeed we did not for a moment mean to insinuate that it should enter into the consideration of the Government in practically dealing with the matter, on the true construction of our declaration of rigid non-intervention, and, still more, on the principle of sound policy, the usual accommodation and appliances which are granted to ships of war in our ports ought to be withheld from this Confederate vessel of war presenting herself under her peculiar circumstances to the notice of the English authorities.</p>

<p>We have waited in vain up to the moment at which we are writing for the decision of her Majesty's Government on this subject. For all that has hitherto appeared the affair of the Nashville remains unsettled. It is certain that some definite and unmistakable rule which would include just such circumstances as those which surround the case of the Confederate ship ought to have been immediately promulgated by the Government, so that there might be no mistake as to the conditions on which armed vessels of either belligerent are henceforth to be allowed to enter British harbours, and as to the rights which they are to enjoy whilst they remain in harbour. It is true that a still more important event may bring the question of the relations which are to exist between this country and the Federals into a condition of exactitude; but it is just possible that the acts of the Commander of the San Jacinto to our mailsteamer Trent may not lead to hostilities between the two countries, and in that case the necessity for accurate and unmistakable rules of neutrality will be more than ever needed.</p>

<p>T<hi rend="smallcaps">HE</hi> greatest excitement prevailed at Southampton last Thursday week by the arrival in the waters there of a large paddle-sloop of war, with pennant, and flying the Confederate flag of America. She proved to be the Nashville, Captain Peagrim, which ran the blockade at Charleston on the 26th of October last; and on her coming to anchor there landed from her, with their personal effects, the crew (twenty-nine in number) of the late American slip Harvey Birch. This latter was a full-rigged vessel of 1500 tons burden, cost 150,000 dollars, and was bound from Havre to New York in ballast, but fallen in with by the Nashville on the morning of Tuesday, the 19th inst., and by her captured and destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The following is the statement of her commander, Captain W. H. Nelson:- The American ship Harvey Birch, of New York, left Havre on Saturday, the 17th inst., bound to New York, in ballast; when in lat 49.6 N., long. 9.52 W., was brought to by the Confederate steamer Nashville, Commander Peagram, late of the United States' Navy. The Harvey Birch was immediately boarded by the officers and crew of the Nashville, who were at once ordered on board the Confederate steamer, allowing Captain Nelson and crew to take a few of their effects and some fresh provisions. The Harvey Birch was then ordered to to fired by Commander Peagrim, who remained alongside until she was burnt to the water's edge.</p>

<p>At half-past twelve o'clock the Nashville arrived off the entrance of the docks, and at one p.m. was moored alongside the north jetty, which was literally besieged with spectators. She brought as passengers, under orders of the Hon. the Secretary of the Navy, Colonel Peyton and lady. Colonel Peyton is on special duty for the State of North Carolina, and, notwithstanding the length of the voyage and the heavy weather experienced throughout her passage, which carried away portions of her paddle-boxes. &c., they are in good health. He says that there are 750,000 bales of cotton of the old crop, and over 4,000,000 bales of the new crop, and 50,000,000 dols.' worth of tobacco and naval stores ready for shipment.</p>

<p>Captain Peagrim is an old officer of the United States' Navy, and bore a conspicuous part in the Mexican War, in the Paraguay and Japan expeditions, and during the war waged by the English and French in China. For his distinguished services his native State of Virginia voted him, by the unanimous voice of the General Assembly of the Legislature, a splendid sword, and Sir John Stirling, in his despatches to the Admiralty, makes the following mention of him:- "It is impossible to speak too highly of the American co-operating party engaged. They were with the Rattler, emulating each other in the thickest of the attack. But my warmest thanks in particular are due to Lieutenant Peagrim, the American senior officer: his encouragement of the men, and coolness under a heavy fire, and determined bravery, when surrounded by a persevering and revengeful foe, was conspicuous to all." First Lieutenant Fauntleroy was Aide-de-Camp to General Johnson at the battle of Manassas. Second Lieutenant Bennett served there in the naval battery, while one youngster on board named Cary received his appointment as midshipman in the Confederate navy as a reward for distinguished gallantry in the same action. The remainder of her company, chiefly Scotch and Irish, consists of two mates, eight midshipmen, paymaster, surgeon, engineer, and staff; firemen, coaltrimmers, and crew, amounting in all to some sixty men.</p>

<p>The Nashville does not carry a very formidable armament, having only two English 12-pounder rifled guns, of Captain Blakeley's manufacture. She is of 1100 tons burden and 800-horse power, and was built for the passenger and coasting trade between New York and Charleston. Though by no means qualified to make a thoroughly efficient ship-of-war, she is superior to many that have been adopted into the service of the belligerents. Like most American passenger-steamers, she is fitted with a deckhouse and hurricane-deck, which would have to be removed before she could he made to answer even tolerably as a gun-boat. Her paddle-wheels are, of course, a great drawback to her utility for actual warfare, while her machinery, being scarcely below the level of the deck, would, in all probability, be disabled by the first shot. She is a good model, and, in smooth water and proper trim, her speed is over fifteen knots an hour. In spite of her top-hamper the officers speak of her qualities as a seaboat, and of her performance during a succession of heavy gales, in terms of the highest praise. She is sister ship to the James Adger, Federal war-sloop, of eight guns.</p>
