<p>By the arrival of the Steamers North American and Hansa we are in

<p>The great battle of Fredericksburg, in which the Federal armies
sustained a disastrous repulse, is described in the Supplement, page
18.</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th the army of the Potomac was withdrawn to
the north side of the Rappahannock, "because," reports General
Burnside, "I felt fully convinced that the position in front could not
be carried, and it was a military necessity either to attack the enemy
or retire." This perilous movement was effected during a stormy night,
and was not discovered by the Confederates until it was too late to
interrupt it. The wounded were all saved, and the pontoon bridges
removed.</p>

<p>The Confederates have advanced their pickets in Fredericksburg to
points near to the banks of the Rappahannock, have increased their
intrenchments in the rear of the city, and thrown up rifle-pits on the
left of the city near the river.</p>

<p>Official reports of the Northern losses put their casualties at
1400 killed, and 8000 wounded, to which may be added 800 taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Confederate commander General Lee has drawn up his report of
the engagement. He acknowledges a loss of 1800 in killed and
wounded. Among the former he names Generals Cobb and Gregg.</p>

<p>The Federal Senate has ordered inquiry to be made into the facts of
the Fredericksburg disaster.</p>

<p>There have been some movements in North Carolina. The Confederate
General Evans had telegraphed that the Federal General attacked
Kingston, on the 13th, with 15,000 men and nine gun-boats. The fight
lasted ten hours, and the Federals were driven back to their
gun-boats. The Northern accounts admit that they lost 500 prisoners
and eleven pieces of artillery. The Southerners were eventually
compelled to retire from the town, the Federal bombardment having
greatly injured it.</p>

<p>The Confederates have made a demonstration against Harper's Ferry, but were repulsed.</p>
<p>Five disabled vessels of Banks's expedition have put into Port Royal.</p>
<p>The Confederates have sunk the Federal gun-boat Cairo with torpedoes
off Yazoo River.</p>
<p>Twenty thousand men have deserted from the army of the Potomac, and the
number is every day increasing.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">New Orleans.</hi></p>

<p>General Butler has issued an order that no person be allowed to
land from any vessel arriving at New Orleans without taking the oath
of allegiance. General Butler had ordered a further assessment of the
cotton-brokers for the support of the poor.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>
<p>The New York journals simultaneously report that Mr. Seward has
resigned, in consequence of a vote of want of confidence in the
Cabinet passed by a caucus of Republican senators.</p>

<p>Attorney-General Bates has given an opinion in opposition to the
Dred Scott decision, and to the effect that coloured men are citizens
of the United States. The case arose from the detention at Perth
Amboy, by a revenue cutter, of a schooner commanded by a coloured man,
who, if not a citizen of the United States, would have been
incompetent to act as her captain. The Attorney-General decides that
all free persons, without distinction of race and colour, if native
born, are citizens. The question of citizenship is distinct from that
of political rights. A child or a woman is a citizen, though not
privileged to vote or take office. The opinions in the Dred Scott case
are pronounced to be of no more authority than the <hi rend="italic">obiter dicta</hi> of eminent lawyers, as the question
before the Supreme Court in that case only involve the jurisdiction
of the Circuit Court. The master of the schooner is pronounced to be
legally competent to command the vessel, and the embargo laid on her
is ordered to be quashed.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>
<p>President Davis has left Tennessee to visit Mobile and the army of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The Commander of the French corvette Yuaalan lately visited Fort
Sumter in company with General Beauregard.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The popular feeling runs high in the North against General Halleck
and Secretary Stanton, to whom the late reverse of the Federal arms is
attributed.</p>

<p>Mr. Rarey, the horsetamer, has been appointed Commissioner of
Horses in the Federal States. His first official act was to go to the
army of the Potomac under Burnside. There he inquired fully into the
health of the horses, and has adopted a new system to check the
mortality among them.</p>

<p>The British Consul at Fredericksburg was arrested by the Federals
on the 11th, on suspicion of being a rebel spy, but was in a short time
released. On the 12th, at the request of General Howard, he was again
arrested, on the charge that he had secreted armed rebels in his
house and then aided them in their escape.</p>

<p>The commercial intelligence states that Congress and the leading
bankers are agreed in the condemnation of Mr. Chase's plan for the
reconstitution of the banks of the country. Gold remains nearly
stationary at about 32 per cent premium.</p></div2>

<p>Advices from Philadelphia state that the fibre of the plant
hibiscos moscheutos is occupying the attention of the merchants at
that port as a substitute for linen rags and jute. This plant is
indigenous to the Northern States, and grows in abundance in the
swampy lands of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, &#x0026;c. At a moderate
calculation, and taking into account the probability of loss from
unforeseen causes, three tons and a half of disentegrated fibre can be
derived from one acre of ground. Two prominent paper manufacturers of
New York have estimated the fibre to be worth 100 dollars per ton, to
be used as a substitute for linen rags in the manufacture of paper.--

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> appears to contain the
best account of the great battle which took place at Fredericksburg
on the 13th of December. The account is dated Fredericksburg, 13th
of December. We give copious extracts:--</p>

<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Theatre Of
Operations.</hi></p>
<p>The theatre of operations to-day extended from Fredericksburg on
the right and down the south side of the Rappahannock for two
miles. Immediately behind the town of Fredericksburg the land forms a
plateau or smooth field, running back for about a third of a mile. It
then rises for forty or fifty yards, forming a ridge of ground which
runs along to the left for about a quarter of a mile, where it abuts
at Hazel Dell, a ravine formed by the Hazel River, which empties into
the Rappahannock west of the town. At the foot of the ridge runs the
telegraph road, flanked by a stone wall. This eminence was studded
with rebel batteries. To the right, along and up the river, the ridge
prolongs itself to opposite Falmouth, and beyond; and here, too,
batteries were placed on every advantageous position. Back of the
first ridge is another plateau, and then a second terrace of wooded
hills, where a second line of fortifications was placed. Between the
rear of the town and the first ridge of hills was the theatre of
operations of the right grand division of the Army under General
Summer.</p>

<p>A word now on the scene of operations of the left grand
division. From the lower part of the town the ridge on which it is
built slopes abruptly down to a comparatively level or undulating
country, which stretches for some miles down the Rappahannock. About a
couple of miles back of the river it rises into a wooded slope. At a
point a mile and a half below Fredericksburg two pontoons had been
thrown across on Thursday morning, and on Friday the whole of the left
grand division, under the command of Major-General Franklin, had
marched over the river. Daylight of Saturday found the force drawn up
in battle array on this broad plain skirting the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>The battle-ground, though very marshy in some places, presented a
fine field for military evolutions. The turnpike leading to
Fredericksburg runs about half a mile from, and nearly parallel to,
the river. Beyond is the railroad, and, still further beyond, the
wooded range of hills in which the enemy were strongly
intrenched. About a mile and a half from Fredericksburg, nearly on the
river edge, is situated A. N. Barnord's stone mansion, after the
English style.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Disposition Of The
Troops.</hi></p>
<p>The line of battle, as it appeared in the morning, was as
follows:--The 6th Army Corps, under General Smith (Franklin's old
force), on the right, composed of three divisions. The 1st Army Corps
(General Reynolds's) extending still further to the left, drawn up in
the following order:--General Gibbons's division on the right,
connecting with General Howe's, General Meade's centre, and General
Doubleday left, fronting to the southward and resting nearly on the
river. This constituted the order in which our forces were drawn up,
there being three distinct lines of battle.</p>

<p>Opposed to our right, under General Sumner, was the rebel left,
under command of General Longstreet. Opposed to our left, under
General Franklin, was the rebel right, under General Jackson. General
Lee, Generalissimo of the Southern army, was in person in command of
the Confederate forces during the whole day.</p>

<p>The plan of General Burnside, agreed upon in council of war, was to
endeavour to pierce the rebel centre. Early on the morning of Saturday
the order was given that Sumner's left, composed of the 9th Army
Corps, under command of General Willcox, should be extended until it
reached Franklin's right--thus forming a continuous line of battle
along the river for two miles, the left resting on the river at the
point where the lower pontoons cross, and the right on
Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>The left wing, comprising the whole of Franklin's command (50,000
men), should then be swung round as on a pivot, formed by Sumner's
extreme right, resting on Fredericksburg. If successful in this
man&#x153;uvre, Franklin would divide the rebel line, taking possession of
the railroad (the line of retreat), and come in on the flank of the
rebel works back of Fredericksburg. While this movement was being
developed, a division was to be sent up from General Sumner's command
by the plank read to storm the ridge. If there should be any failure
in this, it was hoped that the co-operation of Franklin would
presently make success certain. Hooker's corps was designed to act as
a reserve.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Beginning Of The
Battle.</hi></p>

<p>The dawn of Saturday found the forces distributed as thus
indicated. It was a fine Virginia morning, mild and balmy as a
September day, though the mist and fog of a late Indian summer hung
over the field of battle.</p>

<p>It was with alarm and pain I found a general want of confidence and
gloomy foreboding among some men whose sound judgment I had learned to
trust. The plan of attacking the rebel stronghold directly in front
would, it was feared, prove a most hazardous enterprise, and one of
which there is no successful example in military history. It was
doubted that the co-operation of the right and left, according to the
programme, would admit of practical execution, and things were
generally at loose ends.</p>

<p>About half-past eleven o'clock I crossed the Rappahannock on the
upper pontoon-bridge, and passed through the town of Fredericksburg
along the main street. At this time brisk skirmishing was going on in
the outskirts of the town, the rebel sharpshooters stubbornly
contesting every inch of the ground as our skirmishers
advanced. Caroline or Maine street was occupied by General Kimball's,
General Ferrero's, and Acting-General Zook's brigade, with portions of
Hancock's division. The latter, with his artillery, lined the bank of
the river in the neighborhood of the middle crossing, which is just
below the railroad bridge. Other troops from the corps of Generals
Willcox and Couch occupied the other streets of the town nearer the
line of advance. Our batteries replied across the river, covering the
advance of our forces. In the meantime, Franklin had been for a couple
of hours briskly engaged with the enemy on the left. The force in
Fredericksburg had driven the rebels out of the suburbs of the town
and rested their column on the canal. The time had now come to attempt
an advance on the rebel position. The orders were to move rapidly,
charge up the hill, and take the batteries at the point of the
bayonet. Orders easy to give, but, ah! how hard of execution! Look at
the position to be stormed! There is a bare plateau of a third of a
mile which the storming party will have to cross. In doing so they
will be exposed to the fire, first, of the enemy's sharpshooters,
posted behind a stone wall running along the base of the ridge; of a
double row of rifle-pits on the rise of the crest, of the heavy
batteries behind strong fieldworks that stud the top of the hill, of
a powerful infantry force now lying concealed behind these, of a
plunging fire from the batteries of the lower range, of a double
enfilading fire from "cannon to right of them, cannon to left of
them." Sebastopol was not half as strong.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Central Advance.</hi></p>

<p>The line of battle was formed by Conch's corps (the 2nd), composed
of the divisions of French, Hancock, and Howard, the left of the line
abutting on Sturgis' division of Willcox's corps (the 9th). The first
advanced was French's, composed of the brigades of Kimball, Morris, and
Weber, supported by Hancock's division, consisting of the brigades of
Caldwell, Zook, and Meagher. Forming his men under cover of a small
knoll in the rear of the town, skirmishers were deployed to the left
towards Hazel Dell; Sturgis, supporting at the same time, moved up and
rested on a point on the railroad.</p>

<p>The moment they exposed themselves on the railroad forth bursts the
deadly hail. From the rifle-pits came the murderously-aimed missiles;
from the batteries, tier above tier, on the terraces, shot planes of
fire; from the enfilading cannon, distributed on the arcs of a circle
two miles in extent, came cross showers of shot and shell. Across the
plain for a while they swept under this fatal fire. They were
literally mowed down. The bursting shells made great gaps in their
ranks; but these are presently filled by the closing up of the
line. For fifteen immortal minutes at least they remain under this
fiery surge. Onward they press, though their ranks grow fearfully
thin. They have passed over a greater part of the interval, and have
almost reached the base of the hill, when brigade after brigade of
rebels rise up on the crest and pour in fresh volleys of musketry at
short range. They fell back, shattered and broken, amid shouts and
yells from the enemy.</p>
<p>General French's division went into the fight
6000 strong; but at night he told me he could count but 1500.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Federal Batteries Fire On
Their Own Men.</hi></p> 

<p>The fire of the rebel batteries was not the only thing from which
our men had to suffer. Thinking to silence the enemy's guns, our
batteries planted on the bluff on the north side of the river,
embracing some 4&#xBD; siege guns, some batteries of 20-pounder Parrotts,
and the artillery of the left and left centre, opened fire. The
intervening space is between 2700 and 3000 yards--too great a distance
to calculate on the projectiles carrying with accuracy, particularly
contractor's ammunition. If shell should fall short or take an oblique
direction and explode among our troops, it would be difficult to see
how a panic could be prevented. Promptly seeing this danger, General
Hunt, Chief of Artillery, instantly dispatched orders to cease
firing. It was well he did so, for immediately afterwards an
Aide-de-Camp came galloping from General Couch, from the other side of
the river, begging that our batteries should cease, as they were
actually firing into his command.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Battle Continues.</hi></p>

<p>While the broken column retires to its original position in the
outskirts of the town to reform for a new encounter, let us see what
goes on to the left. At daylight the forces comprising the left grand
division of the army appeared, drawn up in battle array on the broad
plain below Fredericksburg, and skirting the Rappahannock. No sooner
had the heavy mist cleared away than Captain Hall's battery (2nd
Maine), planted at the right of Gibbons's division, opened fire upon
the rebels. Artillery fire now became general along the whole line,
which was returned by the rebels. Heavy siege guns in our rear; the
1st Maryland, 1st Massachusetts Batteries, and Battery D, 5th
Artillery, on the right; Captain Ransom's and Captain Walker's in
front: and Cowan's New York, and Lieutenant Hahn's 3rd New York
Independent on the left, and other batteries, kept up a terrific fire
on the rebels. Orders now came to advance, and about nine o'clock
Gibbons's and Meade's divisions commenced moving slowly forward.</p>

<p>The advance resulted in almost straightening our lines, which were
before somewhat of a crescent. Considerable resistance was met with,
yet the forces continued to move forward until, at midday, the line of
battle was three quarters of a mile in advance of where it had been at
the outset. But now came the reserve fire of the enemy with terrific
force.  Shot, shell, and canister were poured into our men from various
points, while the rebel infantry appearing, fired with rapidity. Still
they continued to press on. Severa[l] batteries moved forward at the
same time. As our troops saw the enemy giving way, cheer after cheer
rent the air.</p>

<p>About one o'clock General Meade ordered a charge, which was well
executed, the men pressing on the edge of the very crest, and
skillfully penetrating, by a movement on the flank, an opening which
happened to occur between the division of A. P. Hill and Early's
brigade, captured several hundred prisoners belonging to the 61st
Georgia and 31st North Carolina.</p>

<p>While the fight was progressing at this point the enemy sent four
heavy columns down on our left, near the river. They were handsomely
repulsed and driven back, however, by General Doubleday's
division. Owing to the lack of reinforcements, General Meade's command
was obliged to fall back a quarter of a mile--three-quarters of a mile
beyond the ground first occupied. Very heavy musketry-firing continued
along the line, neither side gaining any material advantage. About
half-past one o'clock the first line of battle in General Gibbons's
division was relieved by the second, when Tower's brigade, now
commanded by Colonel Root, charged over an open field beyond the
railroad and down into the edge of the woods, occupying the
breastworks which the enemy had constructed there, and capturing 200
prisoners belonging to the 36th North Carolina and a South Carolina
regiment. General Gibbons was severely wounded in the right hand. They
held their own for some time, but were eventually compelled to fall
back. It was while the fight was progressing at this point that
General Bayard was fatally wounded. About two o'clock General Birney's
division of General Hooker's grand division, which had been delayed
for some time in crossing by the enemy's shells, moved forward to the
left to the support of Meade's division. Gibbons's had become much cut
up. The musketry fight was then very heavy, and this division suffered
severely.</p>

<p>Adjoining the first corps under Reynolds were the sixth corps under
General Smith, presenting the following formation, in three lines of
battle:--General Newton at the right, General Burke at the centre, and
General Howe on the left, connecting with Reynolds's corps.</p>

<p>At sunrise the skirmishers commenced moving forward, General Vinton
commanding. About eight o'clock the rebels opened a heavy cannonade
upon the men. Some of their batteries were but a short distance
away. A burning dwelling, which attracted considerable attention the
night previous, was destroyed by them in order to make better their
range. Martin's New York Battery, Frank's 1st New York, and Snow's 1st
Maryland replied to the rebel guns with much spirit. At three o'clock
General Newton's was withdrawn from the extreme of this corps, and
took a position on the extreme right of Reynolds's command, where it
was actively employed during the remainder of the day. About four
o'clock the 4th New Jersey were ordered to charge upon a force of the
enemy near the railroad, which they did, driving them back for one
hundred yards or more. A superior force then appearing against them,
they were forced to retire. Colonel H. B. Hatch fell, wounded in the
leg. The rebels ceased their artillery fire on this position of the
army about ten o'clock in the morning. Toward evening, however, they
sent a full brigade in the direction of Martin's battery, who came on
with a yell, expecting to capture it. The warm reception which they
received from the battery and the 2nd and 4th Vermont Regiments, which
were acting as skirmishers, compelled them to fall back. At the same
time the three lines of infantry, composed of Pratt's and Vinton's
brigades, stood to arms, and advanced with fixed bayonets. Night put
an end to further operations on each side, with the exception of
occasional discharges from our heavy guns.</p>

<p>The result of the day's fighting on the left, so diversified in its
character, was to give the left possession of about five hundred yards
in extent. So far as stubbornly holding its own, and even gaining
ground, the left grand division deserves credit. It had, however,
wholly failed to perform the tactical man&#x153;uvre assigned to
it.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Condition of the
Right.</hi></p>

<p>Returning to the right I found General Sumner seated on the front
seat of an unyoked ambulance at the Lacey House, directly opposite
Fredericksburg, at the point where the first pontoon bridge spans the
stream. The old man looked anxious and fearful. Things were not going
well with his command. For three hours his men had been fighting at
fearful odds. They were much exhausted, their loss was excessive, and
nothing had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Indeed, to the test of the ear at the point where we were located,
it seemed as though they were being badly pressed. The batteries had
been brought down and planted at the heads of the streets. The troops
were hugging the city closely to escape the fearful fire. "Where is
Franklin?" was the eager inquiry. "Everything depends on Franklin's
coming up on the flank."</p>

<p>Franklin's position was plainly observable by the line of smoke
and fire a couple of miles to our left below. He was coming no
nearer.</p>

<p>At three o'clock an Aide arrives from General Couch to say that his
(Couch's) troops are advancing finely, but that Willcox was not
keeping up. "Tell General Willcox," replies General Sumner, "tell him
he must make the 9th Army Corps keep pace with the 2nd, if he
can."</p>

<p>At half-past three o'clock, Sturgis, who had been clinging to the
valley amid showers of fire, is so hotly pressed that he hardly thinks
he can hold his own till Griffin comes up. At four o'clock French
reports that his right is held by a brigade (Mason's) which is without
ammunition.</p>

<p>Summer sends a message begging Burnside that Franklin be directed
to advance. But Franklin cannot advance. He has enough to do at
this moment to hold his own, for Jackson has just thrown in
reinforcements, and is pushing hard to turn his left. Meantime the
reserves have not been touched. Hooker's central grand division,
50,000 fresh men, have not yet been engaged; indeed, are yet mainly on
this side of the river. "Tell General Burnside that he had better, by
all means, throw some of Hooker's in." Burnside replies that he has
directly ordered Hooker to go in, and that every man on this side of
the river shall cross.</p>

<p>At four o'clock General Hooker, who had not yet been across the
river, proceeded over, and, in half an hour, prodigious volleys of
musketry announced that Hooker with the reserves is engaged.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Day is Lost.</hi></p>

<p>This last assaulting column consisted of the divisions of Humphrey,
Monk, Howard, Getty, and Sykes. They had, however, hardly got fairly
engaged before the sun went down, and night closed around the
clamorous wrath of the combatants. At this time General Burnside, who
had remained all day at the Phillips House, came down to the Lacey
House, and in the garden facing the city followed the progress of the
fight. Externally calm, the leading player in this tremendous game was
agitated by such intensity of feeling as no one can conceive, and he
paced the garden gloomy as night. "That crest," he exclaimed
passionately, "must be carried to-night." The brevity of time into
which the stupendous issue of the day had to be crowded seemed to add
redoubled energy to the fury of the combatants.</p>

<p>Not "Night, or Blucher !" as Wellington exclaimed at Waterloo, but
rather Ajax's prayer for "more light," was the prompting of every
heart.</p>

<p>Creeping up on the flank by the left, Getty's troops succeeded in
gaining the stone wall which we had been unable all day to wrench from
the rebels. The other forces rushed for the crest. Our
field-batteries, which, owing to the restricted space, had been of
little use all day, were brought vigorously into play. It was the
fierce, passionate climax of the battle. From both sides, two miles of
batteries belched forth their fiery missiles athwart the dark
background of the night. Volleys of musketry were poured forth such as
we have no parallel of in our experience of the war, and which seemed
as though all the demons of earth and air were contending
together. Rushing up the crest, our troops had got within a stone's
throw of the batteries, when the hilltop swarmed forth in new
reinforcements of rebel infantry, who, rushing upon our men, drove
them back. The turn of a die decides such situations. The day was
lost. Our men retired. Immediately cannon and musketry ceased their
roar, and in a moment the silence of death succeeded the stormy fury
of ten hours' battle.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Recrossing of the Rappahannock by
the Federals. </hi></p>

<p>At daylight on Sunday, the 14th inst., heavy artillery firing took
place in front of the divisions of Generals Hooker, Sumner, and
Franklin, and continued until late in the forenoon, but no general
action occurred. The object of both parties was evidently to fool the
other.</p>

<p>During Saturday night and Sunday morning the Confederates
considerably extended their works and strengthened their
position. Large bodies of troops were to be seen on Sunday where few
were to be found on the previous day. The Federal dead which were
killed in front of the enemy's works still remained on Sunday morning
where they fell. When an attempt was made on Saturday night to remove
them, the enemy would open fire with infantry; the wounded were,
however, all removed from the field.</p>

<p>The weather on Sunday was bright and cheerful, and the fog had
entirely disappeared. It was ascertained by inspection through a
powerful glass that there were six distinct lines of works behind the
city. Whether some of these were rifled redoubts simply, or have the
double capacity of affording protection to light infantry, and having
embrasures for light field-guns, could not be discovered. The
appearance of the works, however, would lead to the latter
belief.</p></q>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> of the 15th ult. gives
the following account of the recrossing of the Rappahannock by the
Federals:--</p>
<q><p>There were 40,000 of our troops engaged in the battle of
Saturday. What force the rebels brought against them it is impossible
just now to determine, but from the desperate nature of the resistance
offered it is not improbable that they fully equalled if they did not
outnumber our forces.</p>

<p>With the exception of some heavy firing between the outposts of
both armies there was no fighting on the Rappahannock on Monday (15th
inst.) Everything was quiet, and the terrible battle of Saturday was
not renewed. The Federal troops were busy removing the wounded to the
river side, lest the enemy should shell the city. The Confederates
meanwhile were actively engaged strengthening their defences. At one
time they made a feint to attack General Franklin's forces, but did
not accomplish it. General Burnside inspected the Federal troops in
the afternoon in the town, and was greeted with loud cheers. Activity
throughout every department indicated that a battle was imminent. The
Irish brigade assembled in and around the theatre, where the ceremony
of presenting to it a set of beautiful colours, just sent from New
York, was gone through, General Meagher making an address. The enemy
kept up a regular fire from their batteries upon the upper crossing,
in order to retard the passage of the troops. The surgeons were
ordered to be in readiness to receive and care for a large number of
additional wounded, and red flags were displayed on the tops of many
of the large houses in the town which were to be used for temporary
hospitals.</p>

<p>The withdrawal of the Federal forces from Fredericksburg had,
however, been determined on at a council of all the corps commanders
during the day. It was regarded as a perilous undertaking, but one
that, if successful, would rescue the army from the necessity of
risking another battle with the prospect of accomplishing little
except the destruction of valuable lives.</p>

<p>The troops had received no intimation of their having to retreat,
and had laid down to rest upon their arms for the night. The order for
them to fall in was therefore supposed by many to be for a night
assault upon the enemy's works, and they were not undeceived until
they found themselves upon the pontoon bridges actually returning
across the stream. A heavy gale of wind which blew all sound away from
the rebel lines greatly facilitated the movement. Bridges were covered
with earth to deaden the sound of the moving artillery, and a dark
night hid every object from view. General Franklin's grand division,
occupying the extreme left, began to move as soon as it was dark; and
the right and centre of Generals Sumner and Hooker took up the line of
march almost simultaneously, moving in good order but silently away
from under the very guns of the enemy. All three of the crossings were
used, making six bridges. No accident of consequence occurred. The
troops obeyed with alacrity every order, and waited with patience
their turn to cross. The artillery and infantry alternated in moving
column, very much in the order in which they went into battle. Two
brigades <sic>belong</sic> to General Butterfield's corps were left to occupy
Fredericksburg as advanced pickets. The Federal Artillery placed on
the hither bank of the river co-operated in keeping possession of the
town.</p></q>

<p>The same paper, of the 17th ult., says, in its summary of war
news:--</p>
<q><p>The retreat and evacuation of Fredericksburg, which were
rendered necessary by the disaster of Saturday, and the ascertained
strength and extent of the enemy's fortifications, was a perilous
adventure, but was conducted in safety. It may be consoling, however,
to know that, although the Union forces suffered a loss of some ten or
twelve thousand men in this fruitless attack upon the enemy's
position, General Burnside did not fall too deeply into the trap laid
for him by General Lee, but retired in time to save his army from the
chances of annihilation. It is but just, perhaps, to General Burnside
to say that the adverse movement upon Fredericksburg was not
undertaken in accordance with his own judgment, but was peremptorily
ordered by the military authorities at Washington, who, of course, are
alone responsible for the result. It is stated upon reliable authority
that the rebels sent a notification to our army on Sunday that they
intended shelling the town, and requested that our wounded should be
removed.</p></q></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Literature</hi>.</p>
<p>We have before us another work which is also peculiarly suited to
the moment. It is written by Mr. D. W. Mitchell, an Englishman who has
been a resident in Richmond, Virginia, and is entitled <hi rend="italic">Ten Years in
the United States. Being an Englishman's View of Men and Things in the
North and South</hi> (Smith and Elder). The author states his object to be
to explain, if possible, the most active and powerful causes of the
great revolution which has taken place in the country in which he
lived, working for his livelihood, and, at the same time, observing
human nature as developed in Americans and American politics. The
residence of Mr. Mitchell in the States commenced in 1848, that year
of European convulsions; and he states with confidence that he has
better opportunity than common of observing and understanding the
people of whom he has written, their habits and feelings, their
private and public life, and believes himself capable of pointing out
the causes of the split between North and South, not the less because he,
with some few others, had marked their rise and progress, and
reflected upon the tendency of the life, political and social, of the
United States. The author declares that, in considering and explaining
the facts which he has here collected, he had to abandon many
preconceived ideas and theories of his own, formed before he went to
the States; and he admits that it is more than probable that some of
the statements he has put forth will conflict with the prejudices and
principles of many of his readers; but he protests that he has written
carefully and conscientiously, with a desire to arrive at the truth as
to the right and wrong of the momentous struggle now going on, sinking
for the time sectarian and party prepossessions. The conclusion to
which he arrives is that the separation of the North and South are not
only natural but desirable; that it therefore inevitably follows, as a
matter of course, he does not hesitate to add, that true liberty and
real progress will suffer no drawback from such a change. There will
probably be those who, in learning these premonitory confessions of a
writer on this vexed question, who has been almost a citizen of the
Southern capital too, will at once conclude that he is a writer in the
Confederate interest purely. Well, perhaps he is so, but to a great
extent unconsciously, if not unavoidably; and if his work is taken up
with just so much qualification as is implied in these two
circumstances of avowal of opinion on the broad question and local
tendencies, we think, on the whole, that it will be found to have
dealt with the case as nearly fairly and impartially as
possible. Apart from the political disquisitions which the volume
contains, there is a good deal of characteristic local colouring. The
plan of the book is founded on the notion of endeavouring, as far as
possible, to let the people of the United States describe themselves,
and to let the parties and factions state their own views; and we are
informed that many remarks and reflections which are not printed as
quotations may be taken to be the deliberate opinions of enlightened
Americans, expressed in conversations and discussions at times when
hackneyed professions of party were for the hour forgotten. It should
be observed that the work contains sketches of life and manners,
social and political, at Richmond, at Washington, and at New York
mainly, and some chapters are devoted to somewhat remote--for
America--history, from which deductions are drawn and brought to bear
on modern and immediate circumstances. Even if it had no other merit,
the earlier chapters, which do something for raising the close veil
which now envelopes the South, its inhabitants, and their ways, would
make this book acceptable; but we venture to think that, as a whole,
it is a contribution of some value to the knowledge of the United
States of America, which most of us are glad to come across at this
particular juncture.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICAN MAPS.</p>

<p>Series of American Maps, published by Bacon and Co.,
Paternoster-row, 1862:--1. "Army Map of the Seat of War in Virginia,
showing the Battle-fields, Fortifications, &#x0026;c., on and near the
Potomac River."--This map gives with the greatest clearness all the
physical features and military positions between the Shenandoah River
on the west and Eastern Maryland on the east. Northwards it extends as
far as the Confederates reached in their recent foray into Maryland,
and southward as far as the Rapidan and Fredericksburg. Within these
limits this map leaves nothing to be desired in the minuteness, and at
the same time lucidity, of its topographical details. It is brought
down to Sept. 1, and gives the site of the battle in which General
Kearney was killed. The successive chains of mountains, the rivers,
railroads, and common roads stand out with great distinctness. Of all
military maps of Eastern Virginia which we have seen we prefer this
for reference.--2. "Bacon's New War Map."--This covers a larger field
than No. 1. It includes a portion of Southern Pennsylvania, all
Maryland, Delaware, all Eastern and a part of Western Virginia, and
terminates at the northern boundary of North Carolina. A pink dash
under the names of notorious places materially assists the
investigator in his hunt after localities.--3. "Bacon's Military Map
of America."--This map is a handy map of the United States, British
America, and adjoining portions of Mexico. It extends from ocean to
ocean. Although entitled "military" by virtue of its showing the forts
and fortifications, it is mainly civil in its character. The loyal
Slave States and parts of States and territories are coloured yellow,
interposed between the Free-labour States in green, and the
Confederate States and parts of States in pink.--4. "Bacon's
Steel-plate Map of the American States, showing the railways, forts,
and fortifications." This map terminates about 100 miles west of the
Mississippi. It includes the adjacent part of Canada, and retains this
threefold division as to colour which characterises No. 3.</p>

<p>American Maps, published by W. and A. K. Johnston, Edinburgh,
1862:--1. "Map of the Battle-fields of America, including portions of
Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania." This neat map extends south of
Richmond, James River. A blue line under the names of noted places
aids the eye. Appended to this map is a smaller one of the United and
Confederate States, British America, and part of Mexico. The
Free-labour, Border, and Seceded States are distinguished from each
other by separate colours.--2. "Johnson's map of the United
States."--This map is a converse of the previous one. It consists of
two parts. The larger part gives the United States to 100 miles west
of the Mississippi: the smaller section map is a lucid map of the seat
of war in Eastern Virginia, from Harrisburg and Philadelphia in the
North to below Richmond and Norfolk on the South. The maps of this
series are made to fold conveniently in bookform, or they may be
extended sheetwise.</p>

<p>Colton's Series of Maps. Gun and Co., Craven-street.--"2500 Miles
Around Washington."--At the distance of each 100 miles from the centre
a circle is drawn to enable the inquirer to measure the distance at a
glance. The principal places are indicated by a large dot adjoining
their names. The population of the United States, as they were
according to the three last censuses, is given in tabular form.--"500
Miles Round Cairo, showing the Seat of War in the West."--The same
division by circles is adopted here. Both the maps of this series give
every county and county town in clear type.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent at the
head-quarters of the Confederate army of Northern Virginia has
forwarded to us some Illustrations, which we have been fortunate
enough to receive. This, it seems, is far from being the case
generally, many of his sketches and letters being intercepted. For
example, writing on the 15th of November last, our Artist states that
he had just heard of the capture of a vessel which had some of his
despatches on board, and also of the arrest of a messenger carrying
letters and sketches from him across the Potomac into
Maryland. Indeed, our Special Artist on one occasion recently ran a
great risk of being taken prisoner, having galloped past a cross-road
only a few minutes before a Federal scouting-party dashed through. Two
of our Artist's Illustrations are presented on the preceding page.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Advance of the Federals Towards
Lee Town, Jefferson</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">County, Virginia.</hi></p>

<p>Respecting this Illustration our Correspondent writes as
follows:--</p>
<p>"While visiting General Stuart at his head-quarters the Federals
crossed the Potomac at Shepherdstown and advanced in large force to
within a mile and a half of our camp. Gradually our pickets had to
retire, making a good fight as they fell back, step by step, on their
supports. The night we passed was a most anxious one, as at any moment
the Federal cavalry, had they possessed anything like the dash of the
two or three regiments opposed to them, might have forced our lines
and probably taken most of us prisoners. In the morning, Oct. 16, the
General was in the saddle at dawn, and, taking with him Pelham's
flying artillery, brought one of the pieces into a commanding
position, on a hill, and opened it with great effect on a brigade
advancing on Lee Town, driving back the skirmishers thrown forward
against his own pickets. The Illustration shows the gun coming into
action under the fire of the Yankee skirmishers, surrounded and
followed by the mounted gunners, one of whom is falling, wounded, from
his horse. The cavalry reserves are moving up in the rear.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Retreat Of The Federals From
Jefferson County.</hi></p>

<p>"This Engraving (says our Special Artist) gives a new feature to
the triumphal advance of the 'Young Napoleon' on Winchester, so
boastfully published to the world in the Northern papers. The 'onward
movement' has now become a retreat. In the distance the Federal
artillery has taken up a covering position in the road at the entrance
of the woods, and their cavalry is seen flying across the fields on
each side, seeking the shelter of the timber from the shells which
Pelham is liberally sending after them. General Stuart is on a rise in
the centre of the picture, giving orders and making dispositions for
his troopers to charge, the reserve cavalry having come up. By night
not a Federal remained on the Virginia side of the Potomac of those
who formed part of this triumphal expedition."</p>

<head>Confederate Flag.</head>
</figure>
</p>


<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Confederate Flag.</hi></p>

<p>Our Special Artist inclosed in one of his despatches a flag which
he had begged for us as a trophy, and of which we herewith give an
Engraving. This is its history, as supplied by him:--"When Banks,
commanding the Federals, was attacked by Jackson last spring, and
driven pell-mell through the streets of Winchester, Miss Laura Lee, of
that city, boldly stood forward in the street amidst the flying
bullets and waved this little flag of her own make, cheering on the
Confederate soldiers as they charged through the flying ranks of those
who had covered her and her fellow-citizens with abuse for
months. More than one Confederate fell at her feet as they swept
triumphantly past, and, still waving her little flag in one hand, with
the other assisted the wounded men. This lady is a fair type of all
her Southern sisters--womanly, but brave in her country's cause, and
now praying by the dying beds of those brave men who have fallen
victims to their patriotism."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Claiming Exemption from the
Draught in New York.</hi></p>

<p>Though the draught is postponed in New York it has not been
formally abandoned by the Government. The consequence is that there
has been a great rush to the offices appointed by the Judge
Advocate-General to examine claims of exemption. The claims allowed&#x2014;
are firstly, age under eighteen or over forty-five; secondly, physical
incapacity; thirdly, colour (no negroes or mulattoes being accepted);
fourthly, alien birth and non-naturalisation; fifthly, membership of
the scholastic and clerical professions. A popular caricature recently
represented one of the unwilling conscripts as saying, in answer to
the commissioner's question why he claimed exemption, "I am sixty
years of age; I am an Irishman; my mother was a nigger; I have a
humpback and a clubfoot; I am a confirmed drunkard; and I am a
preacher of the gospel." "You may go, Sir," replied the
commissioner. "Your case is but too complete." The most numerous
claims of exemption have been made by Irishmen and other foreigners,
armed with their passports and consular papers to prove their
nationality. At least fifty thousand such claims are said to have been
allowed. Another numerous class is that of which the members could
only plead their physical disability--such as deafness, short-sight,
malformation of the hand or foot, and, in some instances, inveterate
and incurable dipsomania, proved on the oath of the wives of the
unfortunate delinquents. Another large class is said--but perhaps it is
a libel--to have been composed of men who before the draught was
threatened represented themselves to be from thirty-five to forty
years of age, but who suddenly discovered, after perusal of
Mr. Lincoln's demand for 300,000 conscripts, that they were certainly
forty-six. In all these cases the commissioners insisted upon the
certificate of birth. Our Engraving represents the interior of the
Office of Exemption in the fifteenth ward of the city during the time
when the draught was considered imminent and had been positively fixed
to take place at the end of November.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE WEST INDIES, FREE LABOUR, AND</p>
<p rend="center">COTTON.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ever</hi> since the commencement of the cotton
dearth, and, indeed, on more than one occasion anterior to it, certain
gentlemen whose names we need not specify, but the authenticity and
adequacy of whose information on the matter we propose submitting to
the notice of our readers cannot be reasonably doubted, have done
their utmost to direct the attention of the British public to the
capabilities of the West Indian islands and mainland, and more
particularly of Jamaica, for the culture and preparation of cotton for
the European market.  According to their testimony, it would be
difficult to select within cotton-growing latitudes any other area of
equal extent possessed of so many recommendations for the cultivation
of the precious staple.  It has been proved by actual experiment that
the plant grown in the West Indies may, with ordinary care, be so
reared as to exhibit all the superior qualities, and to command at
Liverpool the best prices, of Sea Island cotton.  It is notorious that
in Jamaica and Guiana immense tracts of suitable land lie waste,
partly in consequence of the ingrossing care devoted to the production
of sugar, but chiefly to a lack of a sufficient number of labouring
population. It is obvious that the position of the Antilles in
relation to Europe is but little less favourable for the transport of
merchandise than that of the Slave States of America.  It is asserted that
even now the labour requisite for cotton plantations can be secured at
a rate of wages which would leave to all parties engaged in the
culture and carriage of the article ample remuneration; but it is
admitted that a large accession of hands would be required to enable
the West Indies to develop, to anything like the extent of which it is
capable and which the wants of Europe demand, a new cotton-growing
interest which shall fully compensate for the loss of the old one.</p>

<p>Now, it happens that, to the powerful arguments urged in favour of
any well-considered scheme for realising the above-named advantages,
the source of events having its course in the American civil conflict
furnishes a series of nearly equal cogency. It is well known that the
fortune of war has placed in the hands of the Federal Government above
200,000 "contrabands,"--i.e., slaves who have either been captured by
the invading troops or who have escaped from their Southern masters to
the Federal camps. These coloured people have become a burden upon the
hands of Mr. Lincoln, and a cause of serious perplexity to his
Cabinet. What is to be done with them? There seem to be strong
objections, physical as well as social, to using them as soldiers. To
transport the whole of them to Liberia would require a respectable
navy, and would entail upon the North an enormous expense.  The
jealousy of the Free States against allowing negro labour to come into
competition with the labour of whites is too strong and active to
admit of a gradual absorption of the African element into the
industrial population.  Meanwhile, they have to be fed and sheltered
at the public expense.  During the continuance of the war, it is true,
a large number of "contrabands" may be employed in the construction of
military works and in performing the duties of the more menial camp
offices.  But their number is constantly on the increase and what
shall be done with them when the present struggle has ceased is a
problem which the lapse of every month renders at the same time more
pressing and more difficult of solution.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have two conditions which, whenever they can be
united, will realise a consummation equally advantageous to us, to our
West Indian colonies, to the Federal<pb n="34"/> Government and people of America,
to the captured and liberated negroes, and to the cause of
humanity. There is a soil waiting for labourers, and there are
labourers waiting for a soil. They are not far distant from each
other. The negroes themselves appear willing enough to go, for the
great success of the black emigrants to the Northern States of Hayti
has proved that in this instance deportation has no necessary
connection with misery. The authorities and planters of the West
Indian Islands are not only willing but eager to receive them, and to
give such reasonable security as may be demanded for respecting their
personal freedom and giving them profitable employment. The Government
at Washington, on such securities being entered into, will not only
let the coloured labourers depart, but will themselves convey, or be
at the expense of conveying, them to their new home. Mr. Adams, the
American Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, has broached the
question to Earl Russell, her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, and has intimated the readiness of the Federal Government to
enter into a convention with that of the United Kingdom for the
removal, to any of the West India colonies, of the blacks in America
to whom the present war has given or may give liberty.</p>

<p>Where, then, is the obstacle, and of what kind is it, that a
proposal which meets the wishes of so many parties is not forthwith
carried into effect? From the tenour of a despatch forwarded by the
Duke of Newcastle to the Lieutenant-Governor of Jamaica it appears
that the British Government are not prepared to enter into such a
convention as that suggested by Mr. Adams; and, from the published
diplomatic correspondence of the American Ambassador, it seems that
our Cabinet, after discussing the subject with fitting seriousness,
came to the conclusion that, "on the whole, it might be the means of
entangling them in some way or other with the difficulties in the
United States, by possible reclamations of fugitives, or in some other
way--a danger which they were most desirous to avoid." However much the
decision is to be regretted, the evident anxiety of the British
Government to avoid furnishing a pretext of quarrel to either of the
belligerents in America will command the approval of the English
public. How far this excessive caution should be carried is a question
not very easy to be determined; and perhaps it is better that those
who are responsible for the maintenance of international amity should
err on the side of apprehension rather than of recklessness. But,
supposing the reason assigned by Earl Russell for declining the offer
of Mr. Seward to be the only one that exists, it is a fair question
for consideration whether our Government are not abnegating national
rights, or, at any rate, abstaining from the exercise of them, beyond
the limits imposed by the exigences of the situation; and whether, on
the ground of what we now refuse to do, demands may not be made upon
us hereafter which we shall certainly resist, even at the cost of
war.</p>

<p>It is matter of notoriety, besides being in strict accordance with
international law, that, as opportunity occurs, we make valid
contracts, whether of purchase or of sale, with both the parties to
the civil war. The tobacco, the rice, or the cotton which reach us,
though in but small quantities, through the North, are just as likely
to have been the property of Confederate planters, and to have changed
hands by other than commercial means during the war, as are the
fugitive negroes. On the Constitutional principles of the Southern
States these now homeless "contrabands" are in precisely the same
position with regard to the outer world as any other article of
property would be which the chances of war had transferred from its
former owner to its present possessor. No nation can pretend, at the
close of a contest with some other nation, that it has a right to
reclaim from those who were neutrals all commodities and "chattels" of
which its citizens may have been deprived by military force, and which
have thereby found their way into the hands of a third party. Besides,
we do not in this country recognise the right of property in
man. Should any one of the African labourers whom our Government
declines to receive in the West Indies, with the double consent of the
Federal Cabinet and of the wretched captives themselves, have found
his way to any part of her Majesty's dominions, even before the period
of the Secession, he would thereupon have become a free man, and we
should have refused the rendition of him to any Power on earth, and at
any risk of consequences. We did so but recently in the case of John
Anderson, who had taken refuge in Canada; and, unquestionably, we
shall do so again and again whenever and by whomsoever reclamation is
made upon us for fugitive slaves. We trust her Majesty's Government
have not, in the excess of their caution, laid ground for the urging
of some such demand upon us when the war shall have ceased. We should
be sorry that an inference could he justly drawn from any decision of
theirs to the effect that the British Government recognise the
doctrine that slaves are property which may be reclaimed,<hi rend="italic"> as such</hi>, by
one Power from another. That we should surrender or even seem to
ignore an iota of our own national creed in this matter for the sake
of showing our delicate impartiality, does not strike us as dictated
by a far-seeing wisdom. And if, on any question affecting
international relations, no decision can be wholly free from risk, it
does appear to us that a convention with the Federal authorities for
the effectuation of an object so desirable to all parties and in all
senses as the one proposed should not have been refused, lest at some
time hereafter we may be asked by an irritated nation to do what we
never have done and never shall do.</p>

<p>The question will be sure to come up in other shapes before long,
and will probably be determined by Parliamentary authority. The last
advices from Jamaica inform us that notice of motion had been given in
the Assembly of that island for the appointment of a committee to
consider the best means of promoting the immigration of the coloured
and black people of the States. Our own Legislature can hardly evade,
or wish to evade, so important a question. The operatives of
Lancashire who are now subsisting, not without a bitter pang, on
public charity, magnanimously scorned to lessen their own distress by
giving their sanction to the continuance of negro slavery. If, then,
their prospects can be brightened, and the staple of their manufacture
largely increased, by a process which, so far as it goes, will convert
slaves into free man, we cannot but think that they have a genuine
claim upon the consideration of their countrymen. Are we entitled to
shut them out from the most promising advantages which have hitherto
been offered them, lest, by acting upon right principles, we may
hereafter be called to account by a Government founded upon wrong
principles? Of course, we take for granted that, should Parliament
show a disposition to assume the responsibility of accepting
Mr. Seward's offer, the Ministers can urge no further objection to
it. To the arrangement itself, whereby the negroes captured by
Northern arms may, with their own consent, he sent across to the West
Indies, they can offer no opposition but that which arises out of
apprehension for the future; but if the country is resolved to face
the risk of war with the yet unrecognised Confederacy, on grounds
which it can fully justify and be proud of, the Government, we cannot
doubt, will cordially concur in its decision.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Norwegian we are in receipt of Boston
and New York journals of the 27th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The army of the Potomac, though for the moment inactive, will not,
it is said, under its present commander, be suffered to go into winter
quarters.</p>
<p>General Burnside has published a further report, in which he
accepts the whole responsibility of the reverse at Fredericksburg and
exonerates the President, General Halleck, and Secretary Stanton from
all blame. He attributes the defeat to the fog and the delay in
building the bridges across the Rappahannock, which gave the
Confederates twenty-four hours more to concentrate their forces in
their strong positions.</p>

<p>The number of wounded on the side of the Federals is finally given,
on the authority of the medical director, to be 7000 instead of 9000,
as previously reported.</p>

<p>The committee appointed by the Senate to inquire into the disaster
at Fredericksburg have presented their report. They examined
Generals Burnside, Hooker, and Franklin, and have presented the
evidence without comment. The Generals agreed that the delay in the
arrival of the pontoon train was fatal, yet it has been impossible to
discover the guilty party, as General Halleck considers his
responsibility terminated with giving the order for their despatch
immediately after the receipt of the request. General Burnside denied
that the troops were demoralised; but General Sumner thought his were,
and that the army required rest.</p>

<p>The report that General Foster had been defeated in North Carolina
was inaccurate. The General pushed on from Kingston and captured
Goldsborough, where he tore up the line of railroad connecting
Wilmington with Richmond, and then retired to Newbern. He fought four
successful engagements, with a loss of about 500 men. En revanche he
captured 500 prisoners and eleven pieces of artillery, with a large
number of small arms.</p>

<p>General Banks's expedition has been sighted in the Gulf of
Mexico. It is confirmed that he will supersede General Butler in the
command of the south-west department.</p>
<p>The Confederates have recaptured Holly Springs, Mississippi. The
Federals lost in this affair 200 killed and wounded and 150 prisoners,
also 500,000 dols. worth of stores.</p>
<p>President Davis has issued a proclamation retaliatory upon
Butler. He and all his officers are to be hung if taken, but their
soldiers are to be paroled. Negroes taken in arms and their officers
are also to be hung.</p>

<p>A large steamer, bringing a heavy stock of shoes, blankets, and
cloth for the Confederate Government, got safely into Charleston
Harbour recently.</p>

<p>General Bonham has been appointed Confederate Governor South
Carolina, in place of General Gregg, killed.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>A full account of the interview between the President and the
caucus of Republican senators, who passed a vote of want of confidence
in a part of the President's Cabinet, has been published. The
President heard what the senators had to say, and then respectfully
declined to accede to their request, on the ground that what the
country needed was military success, and that his Cabinet Ministers,
"even were they angels," could not guarantee that. The resolution was
principally levelled at Mr. Seward, on account of his conservation in
home politics and his irritating attitude in the management of foreign
affairs. The latter ground was urged by Senator Sumner, the chairman
of the Senate's Committee on Foreign Affairs. In consequence of the
refusal of the President to accept the resignations of Messrs. Seward
and Chase, those gentleman continue to hold office. This is the first
attempt in the course of American Constitutional history to make the
personnel of the Administration dependent on Congress. It has failed
in the present instance.</p>

<p>The President hesitates to sign the bill admitting Western Virginia
as a separate State.</p>
<p>The efforts of the representatives of the Border State men to
induce the President to cancel his proclamation of the 22nd of
September have been futile, but he thinks favourably of their petition
that Tennessee and portions of Eastern Virginia, where manifestations
of loyalty have been made, be excepted from its operation.</p>

<p>Congress, by a vote of 77 against 33, has given leave to report a
bill appropriating 20,000,000 dols. to Missouri to aid her in
emancipating her slaves.</p>

<p>A bill embodying Secretary Chase's proposals for raising
300,000,000 dols. for the service of the current year, and 600,000,
000 dols. for the service of the next fiscal year, has been introduced
into the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe has published in the current number of
the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> a reply to the appeal made to the women of
America by the women of Britain on the subject of slavery ten years
ago. She says that those who felt the weight of that appeal have had
hitherto no leisure to reply to it:--</p>

<p><q>All their time and energies were already absorbed in direct
efforts to remove the great evil concerning which the minds of their
English sisters had been newly aroused, and their only answer was the
silent continuance of these efforts. The time has come, however, when
such an astonishing page has been turned in the anti-slavery history
of America that the women of our country, feeling that the great
anti-slavery work to which their English sisters exhorted them is
almost done, may properly and naturally feel moved to reply to their
appeal, and lay before them the history of what has occurred since the
receipt of their affectionate and Christian address.</q> After giving
her version of the anti-slavery contest in the United States during
the past ten years, and charging English public opinion with a leaning
in favour of the establishment of a slaveholding Confederacy, she
apostrophises the women of England thus:--</p>

<p><q>And now, sisters of England, think it not strange, if we bring
back the words of your letter, not in bitterness but in deepest
sadness, and lay them at your door. We say to you,--Sisters, you have
spoken well; we have heard you; we have heeded; we have striven in the
cause, even unto death. We have sealed our devotion by desolate hearth
and darkened homestead--by the blood of sons, husbands, and
brothers. In many of our dwellings the very light of our lives has
gone out, and yet we accept the life-long darkness as our own part in
this great and awful expiation, by which the bonds of wickedness shall
be loosed, and abiding peace established on the foundation of
righteousness. Sisters, what have you done, and what do you mean to
do? In view of the decline of the noble anti-slavery fire in
England--in view of all the facts and admissions recited from your own
papers--we beg leave, in solemn sadness, to return to you your own
words.</q> The reply is signed by Mrs. Stowe "in behalf of many
thousands of American women."</p><pb n="35"/>

<p>Orders for the supply of the French army in Mexico continue to be
executed in New York. The Mexican Minister has protested, but
Mr. Seward declines to interfere.</p>

<p>Thirty-nine out of the 300 Sioux Indians imprisoned at Dakoa,
Minnesota, were to be hung on the 27th for their complicity with the
massacre of the whites, and fears are entertained that the whites will
"lynch" the rest. The colonel commanding the post has invoked the aid
of the law-abiding portion of the citizens.</p>

<p>The British steamer Scotland has arrived at San Francisco from
Hong-Kong, Shanghai, and Kanagawa. The Scotland is the pioneer of a
new British line of steamers which are to make a monthly trip between
San Francisco, Japan, and China. The charge for freight is 12 dols. a
ton, and for passengers 250 dols. each. The Scotland brought 700 tons
of freight from China, and 300 tons from Japan, principally
teas.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> attitude of the Federals up to the
time of sending away the last mail resembles that of the crew of a
vessel which has just sustained a most terrific shock from a monster
wave. The fierce blow has been delivered, the ship has reeled, and
there ensues a moment of paralysed wonder. By this time, no doubt, the
public mind has recovered its elasticity, and is engaged with the
fearful details of the Fredericksburg disaster; but we have only
evidence how the people have been, for once, stunned by a defeat. And
no wonder. A nation that did not feel deeply wounded and humiliated by
such a blow would, indeed, be unworthy. It is not the mere fact that a
fine army has been crushed and its remnant sent in disgrace across the
little river that had been absurdly called its Granicus--heavy reverses
have been sustained ere this, and the beaten side has lost nothing
save the day and many men, and has rallied and retrieved its laurels;
it is that the Fredericksburg disaster is a blow driven home to the
very heart of the American system--a blow which has demonstrated to the
world that the institutions under which such an event is possible can
no longer be relied upon as State mechanism. It is not that an
accident has happened to machinery; it is that the machine has proved
a failure.</p>

<p>General Burnside has had the courage, or tact, or reckless&#x2014;<pb n="39"/>ness to
declare himself solely responsible for the movements which ended in
the carnage of Fredericksburg. But the people are not to be deceived
by any such transparent advice. It may be perfectly true that the
final arrangements for the attack were the General's own; they could
hardly be otherwise; but it is notorious that the advance itself was a
political as much as a military movement, and was a necessity of
party. This is the fatal truth; and in the fact that, in order to
meet the exigencies of party, as understood in America, it is
permitted to slaughter 10,000 men, is or should be the death-sentence
of the present system. It was well known that the attack could be
successful only by a miracle, and M'Clellan had preferred to sacrifice
his own position as head of the army rather than hurl it upon almost
certain destruction. But the party found a General who owned himself
no great master of war, and who did not hesitate to rush upon the
Confederate intrenchments in a way that proved that he had not
under-estimated his own professional ignorance. He was not even
supplied with the means of making his mad attack in the best way; his
pontoons were "forgotten;" and the whole chapter, from the beginning
to the end, was one of misfortune. Still, and here is the most
lamentable thing of all, the politicians of the North do not appear to
consider that anything discreditable has been done. They are staggered
by the magnitude of the slaughter which a party move has caused, but
they are unable to see that such a step was one of guilt, or that the
conduct of a campaign should be dictated by military considerations
and not by the momentary need of a faction. It is difficult for
English readers to realise this state of things. Perhaps they may form
a very rough idea of it by supposing that we are at war with France;
that a French army lies in a very strong position near Boulogne; that
the Government, say Lord Palmerston's, is very unpopular, and public
credit not good; and that Mr. Disraeli's friends have been winning a
great many elections, and threaten a crisis. At this moment, and
desirous to please the people by a sign of vigour, Lord Palmerston and
the War Secretary intimate to Lord Clyde that at all hazards he must
attack the French. Lord Clyde obeys, and leads the army into a
semicircle of fire, where, throughout a whole day, our men are mowed
down by artillery against which he can do nothing. At night he
retreats, leaving ten thousand soldiers on the field; but Lord
Palmerston has asserted his reputation for being in earnest, and
Mr. Disraeli does not give notice of a vote of want of
confidence. That is not a parallel case, but it is sufficiently like
what has occurred to make an English reader indignant that such a
state of things can be held compatible with Christian
civilisation.</p>

<p>This fourth defeat of the North is no doubt very important, but it
is not one which adds much to the glory of the South. The day could
not have gone otherwise than as it did, and Lee and Jackson must have
been astounded at the madness which delivered over the troops of the
North to such inevitable destruction. The Confederates had really
little to do but to serve their guns, and this they did
admirably. Such part of the affair as partook of the nature of a
battle did no discredit to either side, and Jackson himself was either
forced back, or chose to retreat for a considerable distance. We do
not believe the majority of the stories that impute bad fighting to
the Northerners. If they fought badly at all it was because they were
badly led; and the murderous system--there is no other word for it--of
intrusting important movements to officers who have never been
educated and have been chosen by election, is responsible for anything
like disgrace that may have attached to any of the regiments. The
individual American fights excellently while he can depend upon
himself; but the moment he is asked for the soldier's faith in his
officer he is helpless, for he is in the habit of thinking, and his
reason tells him that the officer will probably lead him to be knocked
on the head to no good purpose. Then, very likely, the American walks
away or runs away; but it is sheer insolence to call this
cowardice. Give him officers, and teach him to obey them
unhesitatingly, and the chronicle of this war will tell another
story.</p>

<p>But it is the system that is ruining the fortunes of the Republic,
in the field and out of it. There is no such thing as political
conscience; and the soldiers are as much made the counters in the game
as they ever were in the old monarchical wars of Europe, against which
so many well-deserved taunts used to be launched by popular
writers. Only, upon the old kingly vices the Republicans have
engrafted new ones of their own. The Kings sent their men to the
battle, but it was at least under commanders who knew their business,
and who did not throw away life unnecessarily except under
circumstances of a very peculiar description. Generals were sometimes
accused of not utterly defeating an enemy because it was highly
desirable that he should be left strong enough to ensure another
year's campaign; but when they fought him they did so in a rational
manner, had an object in view, and either gained it or retired in
fitting time if the object were unattainable. But the American system
sends men into the field under the leadership of officers who are
chosen because they have political influence, or can make loud
speeches, or are very liberal with their liquor at the tavern bar; or
even because they have kept a tavern bar, and have not been over harsh
in insisting on the payment of scores. With such machinery of war the
enlightened people of America are content, or have been content, to
fight the greatest contest which the present generation has seen. It
is hardly conceivable that they will not one of these days make short
work with a system which makes a battle a mere savage scramble, to
which (again thanks to the system) men are hounded on to satisfy the
exigencies of faction.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent in
America, having, in common with the correspondents of other European
journals, been curtly refused permission to accompany the Federal
forces, has pitched his tent in the opposite camp, whence, as
opportunity serves, he forwards to us his Illustrations of the
War. Thus it happens, without any intention of the kind on our part or
on that of our Artist, that his Sketches illustrate the varying
aspects of the war from the Confederate instead of from the Federal
point of view, and have possibly, in consequence, a colouring somewhat
different from that which would have marked sketches taken by the same

<head>The Civil War in America: General
      Longstreet's Corps (Confederates) Crossing the Blue Ridge from
      the Shenandoah to the Rappahannock, Virginia.--From a Sketch by
      Our Special Artist.</head>
</figure>

 Number contains three
illustrations by our Special Artist, respecting which he writes as
follows:--</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Night Amusements in the
Confederate Camp.</hi></p>

<p>"Every evening, when we cluster around our pine-log fires, the
'darkies' press in amongst us and listen to the yarns their masters
spin.  In our camp we are fortunate enough to possess the most famous
banjo-player in the Southern States, and when Sweeny strikes up one of
his quaint old Virginian breakdowns, some nigger is sure to 'wade' in
and put his legs through a series of marvelous gyrations, to the delight
of the sympathetic lookers-on, who beat time for him.  Although the
enemy is within cannon-shot, no one experiences the least uneasiness,
and the universal refrain is, 'We'll sing to-night and fight
to-morrow--bullyboys, oh!' "</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General Longstreet's Corps
Crossing the Blue Ridge, Virginia.</hi></p>

<p>"Of the entire Confederate army encamped near Winchester Jackson's
corps alone remains, and that, I presume, will soon follow the main
body into Loudon County, where Burnside menaces with an immense army
the line of the Rappahannock in this, the third, advance of the
Federals on Richmond.  The subject of the Engraving is one of the
picturesque passes in the Blue Ridge, with General Longstreet's
corps-d' arm&#xE9;e passing through on its way to Culpepper to hold in check
the Northern forces.  The scenery of these Virginian mountains
reminds me forcibly of the Apennines, and recalls many scenes which I
have witnessed with Garibaldi's forces in Southern Italy."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Position Of The Federal And The
Confederates Pickets At</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Fredericksburg On
Dec. 4.</hi></p>

<p>"The Rappahannock at Fredericksburg (writes our Artist on the day
he took the above Sketch) is scarcely more than a hundred yards in
width, and this is the distance that divides the Confederates from the
Federals.  The pickets of each army are within earshot and in full
view of each other, and they frequently indulge in remarks that might
be taken exception to in polite society.  While making the
accompanying Sketch a sentinel who was leaning on his musket, looking over me,
suddenly called out to a blue-coated German on the other side, 'How
many men have you got over thar, Yank?'  'Doo or dree dousand,' grunted
the Teuton.  'Oh, bring them along; that's nothing.  We reckoned you
had an army!'  It is whispered at head-quarters to-day that an attempt
will be made by the enemy to cross the river at three different points
during the night.  Everything is ready for them when they come, and
the battle that will possibly take place within the next few days must
determine, as far as the Federals are concerned, whether the war is to
continue or not: it will be by far the largest and most important of
the whole campaign.  Probably not less than 250,000 men will be
engaged.  I am lying out in the pine-woods at the advance, ready to
wield my pencil when the struggle begins.  Every shot we hear as we
lie with our feet to the fire during the long cold nights starts us on
our legs, for we know the enemy has his pontoons ready to cross in the
darkness.  What a bursting of shells over my bed there will be when
the ball opens!"</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Fredericksburg.</hi></p>

<p>The little town of Fredericksburg, which has been rendered famous
by the great battle fought near it on the 13th ult., had previously
suffered rough usage, having been alternately in the hands of
Confederates and Federals two or three times.  It is the chief town of
Spottsylvania county, Virginia, and is situated on the right bank of
the Rappahannock River, at the head of tidewater.  It is between fifty
and sixty miles from Richmond by railroad, and sixty-five miles by the
turnpike, in a northerly direction.  The town is pleasantly situated
in a fertile valley, and has advantages for commerce and
manufactures. The railroad from Washington, vi&#xE0; Acquia Creek,
passes through it, and as the through-trams generally stop at
Fredericksburg Station for about an hour on each trip, a not
inconsiderable chance trade was caused thereby in the immediate
locality of the d&#xE9;p&#xF4;t. A good canal has bee constructed
from the town to a point on the Rappahannock River about forty miles
above, by which large quantities of wheat, flour, and tobacco were
formerly received for exportation. The river affords extensive water
power, which, however, has not been much used.  The hills in the
neighbourhood, varying from forty to one hundred feet high, abound in
fine granite and freestone.</p>

<p>About thirty years since the prospect of Fredericksburg being a
rapidly-rising town was very great; but it suddenly stopped in its
prosperity, and after, as it were, standing still for about twenty
years, gradually retrograded in importance.  In 1840 its population
numbered 4000 souls, and in 1850, ten years after, it had only
increased eighty-eight persons--less than nine each year, and being
about two per cent in the decade--a remarkably small increase.  Before
the war it contained five churches, one orphan asylum, two
seminaries, four newspaper-offices and two banks.  Such <hi rend="italic">was</hi>
Fredericksburg.  The correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> reports:--"It
is 'living' Fredericksburg 'no more.'  A city, soulless, rent by the
wrack of war, and shooting up in flames athwart night's sky, is the pretty
little antique spot by the Rappahannock, erewhile the peculiar scene
of dignified ease and retirement."</p>

<p>The Rappahannock River rises in the Blue Ridge, but a few miles
from the south fork of the Shenandoah, and pursues an easterly course to
Fredericksburg, some sixty miles south-south-west of Washington city,
where it is within ten miles of the Potomac.  It has here become a
broad navigable stream, though its extreme sources are hardly eighty
miles distant.  From Fredericksburg it has a general south-east course
till it is lost in Chesapeake Bay, some twenty-five miles below the
mouth of the Potomac.  For the present its course below Fredericksburg
is commanded by the Union gun-boats, but above that city it becomes
disputable, and has for months in good part divided the Union from the
Confederate forces.  It naturally forks towards its source into
innumerable streams and rivulets, but at first, some ten miles above
Fredericksburg, into two main branches, whereof that coming from the
north-west retains the name of Rappahannock, while that from the
south-west is known as the Rapidan.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CAREER OF THE ALABAMA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. S. M. Underhill</hi>, writing from St. Thomas, West Indies,
furnishes the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> with a short history of the career of the
Confederate war-steamer Alabama, obtained from the late boatswain of
the "290":--</p>

<q><p>The "290" was built by Mr. Laird, the eminent shipbuilder of
<sic>Rirkenhead</sic>, under contract with a Mr. Butcher. She was regularly
contracted and paid for; and as nothing transpired during her
construction to warrant the supposition that she was destined to hoist
the ensign of the Southern Confederacy, no laws of neutrality were
infringed. Indeed, it was hinted that the vessel was intended for the
service of the Emperor of China. Her keel was laid in the beginning of
this year (1862), and she was launched in April thereafter, though she
was not ready for sea for the succeeding three months. The "290" is
simply a large wooden screw gun-boat, such a vessel as is in European
navies styled a corvette. She is very strongly built of the best
materials, and is constructed to carry ten guns--viz., one rifled
100-pounder, one 68-pounder, and eight 32-pounders--i.e., four
32-pounders on each broadside, throwing collectively 128lb. solid shot
at each discharge, and two pivot guns. She is barque-rigged, and is
fitted with a pair of very powerful engines, by Penn, of London. She
left Birkenhead towards the end of July, ostensibly on a trial-trip,
having on board a large party of ladies and gentleman. On getting out
of the Mersey, this party was sent back in a tug-boat, and the "290,"
as had been previously arranged, neglected to return to Birkenhead,
but steamed direct for the island in the Atlantic where she was to
take in her guns, ammunition, &#x0026;c. On leaving England, the "290" had a
crew of ninety-three men, for the most part belonging to the English
Naval Reserve, all being trained gunners, and the majority old
men-of-war's men. She was temporarily commanded by Captain Bullock,
who had under him the proper complement of commissioned and petty
officers. Captain Bullock, having learned that the Tuscarora lay in
wait for him in St. George's Channel, took his departure by what is
known as the North Channel, thus eluding his Federal enemy; though
even had he been intercepted the Northener would have found himself in
a dilemma, as the "290" had a set of English papers, and other
presumptive proofs of her neutrality, in the face of which it might
have been difficult for her captor to have acted. The "290" at this
time carried no guns or other warlike stores, but consisted merely of
the hull, spars, and engines, except, of coarse, coal and other
requisites to enable her to reach her destination, which was Tarissa,
one of the Azores or Western Islands, belonging to Portugal. This
destination the "290" duly reached, after a fine run of eight days,
and came to an anchor in Tarissa Roads, nothing of any moment having
occurred to break the usual monotony of a sea voyage.</p>

<p>Some time before the departure of the "290" from the Mersey a large
barque left the Thames (cleared for Demerara, West Indies) to meet the
"290" at Tarissa, and there transfer to the latter vessel the guns and
stores destined for her, and which formed the cargo of the
barque. Some reason required to be assigned to the Portuguese
authorities for the " 290" having anchored in their bay, and
accordingly the excuse furnished to them was that her engines had
broken down. This plea was accepted as a valid one, and during the
week that intervened betwixt the arrival at Tarissa of the "290" and
the barque the crew of the former vessel were engaged ostensibly in
repairing her engines, but really in preparing her to receive her
guns, &#x0026;c. About the lapse of a week from the arrival of the "290" the
barque above mentioned sailed in and anchored, her captain alleging as
a reason to the Portuguese officials that his vessel had sprung a
leak, which would require to be repaired ere she could resume her
voyage; and on this understanding the Portuguese at once placed her in
quarantine(which in the Azores lasts three days). On the day after the
barque's arrival, Captain Bullock, of the "290," being anxious to get
his guns on board, hauled alongside of the barque, and erected a pair
of large shears to effect the transfer of her cargo from the barque's
hold to the "290's" deck. This brought off the Portuguese in a fury
that their rules should have been broken by the "290" having dared to
communicate with a vessel which had still two days' quarantine to run,
and they angrily demanded to know the reason why their regulations had
been infringed.  They were told that the barque was in a sinking
state, and the erection of the shears was accounted for by urging the
necessity for an immediate temporary transfer of her cargo, that the
leak might be reached and stopped; and Captain Bullock finally
succeeded in bearing down all opposition by feigning to get in
passion, saying he was doing no more for the barque than any
Englishman would do for a countryman in distress. The Portuguese left
the vessel, and the transhipment proceeded without farther hindrance
from those on shore.</p>

<p>About the afternoon of the second day, and when the transfer was
nearly complete, the British screw-steamer Bahama came in, having on
board Captain Semmes and the other late officers of the Sumter, besides
the remainder of the "290's" armament, and an addition of twenty odd
men to her crew. On the Bahama's arrival and anchorage on a somewhat
similar pretext to those given to her two predecessors, the Portuguese
fairly lost all patience, and peremptorily insisted on the instant
departure of all three vessels. The Bahama at once communicated with
the "290," and, having handed over to the latter vessel everything
destined for her, got up steam and left, followed by the "290," towing
the now empty barque. All three went, not to sea, as they had been
ordered to do, but to Angra Bay (a bay in the same island, and only a
few leagues distant from Tarissa Roads). Here they remained unmolested
until noon the following day (a Sunday), when, for the second time,
all three vessels were ordered out of the Portuguese waters. All the
"290's," guns being now mounted, and the vessel otherwise ready for a
cruise, the order was obeyed, and all took their departure, the
barque, as before, in tow of the "290," which, having convoyed her
well out to sea, cast her off, and with a favouring breeze she steered
for Cardiff, to bring out a further supply of coal for the "290's"
future use. The "290" and the Bahama now steamed round the island, and
Captain Semmes, coming out of his cabin, ordered his First Lieutenant
to muster the crew aft. This having been done, and all the officers
assembled on the poop in their full uniform (i.e., Confederate grey
frock-coat and trousers), Captain Semmes, enjoined silence, and read
his commission as Post Captain in the Confederate Navy. It was a
document duly attested at Richmond, and bore the signature of
"Jeff. Davis, President Confederate States of America." He then opened
and read his sealed orders from the President, directing him to assume
command of the Confederate sloop of war Alabama, hitherto known as the
"290," in which (having been duly commissioned) he was to hoist the
Confederate ensign and pennant, and "sink, burn, and destroy
everything which flew the ensign of the so-called United States of
America." Captain Semmes then ordered the First Lieutenant to fire a
gun and run up the Confederate flag and pennant. The gun was fired by
the Second Lieutenant (Armstrong, a relation of the famous inventor),
and ere its smoke had cleared away the stars and bars of the young
Confederacy were floating on the breeze, and the ceremony was
complete--Captain Semmes declaring the vessel henceforth to be known as
the Alabama to have been duly commissioned. The next step was formally
to engage the crew to serve and fight under the Southern flag, which
having been done, the men were addressed by their captain in an
eloquent and stirring speech, in the course of which he said there
were only four vessels in the United States' Navy that were more than
a match for the Alabama; but he said that in an English-built heart of
oak as she was, and surrounded as he then saw himself by British
hearts of oak, he wouldn't strike his newly-hoisted flag for any one
of the four. Of course this elicited a hearty burst of cheering for
President, States, and Captain, and, when it had subsided, Captain
Semmes said the Bahama was on the point of leaving for England, and
intimated that if any of his crew repented of the step they had
taken, they were free to return in her. This alternative none would
accept, and Captain Bullock and a few of the other officers who had
taken the "290" from England to the Azores, finding their occupation
gone, through the arrival of those who had held similar appointments
in the Sumter, having gone on board the Bahama, that vessel and the
Alabama, amidst hearty cheering from the crews of both, parted
company, the former pursuing her course back to England, the latter in
chase of a Yankee whaler, which she captured and burned. This was her
first prize, and her subsequent career is now so famous as to render a
single remark thereon superfluous. The Alabama's crew receive from the
Confederate Government half the value of every American ship and cargo
they destroy, and each of her crew is now worth several hundred
pounds. All obligations to them have hitherto been faithfully
discharged in gold. The Alabama is supplied with coal from Wales by
three sailing-vessels thus constantly employed.</p></q></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamers Etna and Bohemian we have New York
journals of the 3rd inst. and telegrams to the afternoon of that
day. The most important item of intelligence is the issue of</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Emancipation
Proclamation.</hi></p>

<p>After reciting the previous conditional proclamation of
Sept. 22, the President proceeds to declare as follows:--</p>

<q><p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United
States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of
the Army and Navy of the United States, in time of actual armed
rebellion against the authority and Government of the United States,
and as a fit and necessary war measure for suppressing said rebellion,
do, on this first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaim for the full period of one hundred days from the
day of the first above-mentioned order, and designate as the States
and parts of States wherein the people thereof respectively are this
day in rebellion against the United States, the following, to
wit:--</p>

<p>Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana--except the parishes of St. Bernard,
Placquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension,
Assumption, Terra Bonne, Lafourche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans,
including the city of New Orleans--Mississippi, Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia--except the
forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the
counties of <sic corr="Berkley">Berkley</sic>, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York,
Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and
Portsmouth, and which excepted parts are for the present left
precisely as if this proclamation were not issued.</p>

<p>And, by virtue of the power, and for the purpose aforesaid, I do
aver and declare that all persons held as slaves within said
designated States and parts of States are and henceforward shall be
free, and that the Executive Government of the United States,
including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognise
and maintain the freedom of said persons.</p>

<p>And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to
abstain from all violence unless in necessary self-defense, and I
recommend to them that in all cases, when allowed, they labour
faithfully for reasonable wages.</p>

<p>And I further declare and make known that such persons of suitable
condition will be received into the armed service of the United
States, to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and
to man vessels of all sorts in said service.</p>

<p>And, upon this--sincerely believed to be an act of justice,
warranted by the constitution, upon military necessity--I invoke the
considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favour of Almighty
God.</p></q>

<p>The proclamation is countersigned by Mr. Seward. Of the Virginian
counties mentioned by name therein, only one, Berkeley, is on the
Potomac. The others are on the eastern shore of Chesapeake Bay, or at
the mouth of the James River. The State of Tennessee, although a
seceded State, is not touched by this proclamation.</p><pb n="59"/>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Its Reception.</hi></p>

<p>The Federal Generals in the South seem to interpret the
proclamation each according to his own bias. Thus, General Saxton, the
Military Governor, at Port Royal, South Carolina, has issued a
proclamation to the negroes in his department stating that it is their
duty to carry the news of their freedom to their brethren still in
slavery. On the other hand, General Banks, who has superseded General
Butler at New Orleans, has addressed the people of Louisiana,
informing them "that the changes suggested therein" do not take effect
on the 1st of January, nor at any precise period.  No public
demonstrations will be allowed, and the slaves are advised to remain on
their plantations "until their privileges shall have been definitively
established." No man will be allowed to take the law into his own
hands. Coloured soldiers are to be put under surveillance, and neither
allowed to make nor receive visits. No fugitives are to be returned to
their masters, but no encouragement is to be given to the slaves to
leave their masters.</p>

<p>General Burnside's army has already received a number of fugitives,
and in Norfolk the freed men have celebrated the great event. They met
together on the last day of the old year and formed a procession of at
least 4000 persons. Headed by a band of music, they paraded through
the principal streets of the city. They carried several Union flags,
and cheered loudly for emancipation.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The army of the Potomac is still inactive.</p>
<p>On the last day of the old year a battle commenced between General
Rosencranz's army and that commanded by Generals Joseph Johnston and
Bragg. The battle took place near Murfreesboro', in Tennessee. It
lasted two days, and at the close the Confederates still held their
intrenched positions within which they had been driven on the first
day's fight. The losses on both sides are heavy. Three Federal
Generals were wounded, and the Confederate Generals Cheatham and Rains
were killed. It is supposed that the attack will be renewed. We have
none but Federal reports of this battle.</p>

<p>The Richmond papers say that the Federals attacked Vicksburg on the
27th, 28th, and 29th ult., and were repulsed each time.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>The Richmond <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> contains a violent article upon England for
refusing to co-operate with Napoleon's mediation project. It says,
"England could have made fast friends with the South, but that time
has now gone by for ever."</p>

<p>General Banks has superseded General Butler at New Orleans. The
latter has been recalled to Washington at the instance of the French
Government. General Butler publishes an address to the people of New
Orleans defending his proceedings by reference to severities practised
by British and French Generals in the last three centuries.  He
alludes to Great Britain and France "as the most polished and the most
hypocritical nations of Europe," and boasts that, though he may be
cursed in the salon, he will be blessed in the cottage.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>The President has signed the bill admitting Western Virginia as a
separate State.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith of Indiana, Secretary of the Interior, and
member of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, has resigned his office, presumably
because of his disapproval of the emancipation policy.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The New York Chamber of Commerce has passed resolutions to the
effect that the war made upon American commerce by the Alabama is not
rebuked by the British press, nor the fitting out of vessels stopped
by the British Government, and that American merchants in the rise of
freights are subject, to a certain extent, to the evils which would
attend a state of war with England, while England enjoys the
advantages of a neutral.  A committee was appointed to report what
action the Chamber shall take in the matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Horatio Seymour has been inaugurated Governor of New York. He
made a speech declaring that he would uphold the State Constitution
and see to it that the laws were respected; that his position gave him
little control over national events, but he hoped the Union would be
one and indivisible before his term of service expired. His first act
was to order the trial of the New York Police Commissioners and
Superintendent Kennedy, for permitting the use of the New York Police
Station for the illegal detention of citizens.</p>

<p>The Governor of Missouri, in his annual message, has recommended
the passage of an act providing for the gradual abolition of slavery
in that State, with the pecuniary aid of the Federal Government. The
State Legislature is strongly in favour of carrying out the same
policy, the only difference being whether the Governor's plan is
sufficiently speedy in its operation.</p>

<p>Captain Wynn, of the British Army, had been arrested in Baltimore,
on his arrival from Richmond, on the charge of acting as an emissary
of the Confederates. His companion, another British officer, was not
interfered with.</p>

<p>The Great Eastern was to have left New York for England on the 3rd,
but, in consequence of a heavy fog, the pilot advised that she should
be delayed until the weather cleared up.</p>

<p>A dispatch from St. Paul, Minnesota, states that thirty-eight
Indians, condemned for taking part in the massacre, were hung, at
Mankato, on the morning after Christmas Day, and that the gallows was
so constructed that all fell at once.</p></div2>

<p>The Alabama had played a bold trick. On the 7th of December she
intercepted the New York and Aspinwall steamer Ariel, off the east end
of Cuba, and took from her 9000 dols. The Ariel was then allowed to
proceed on bonds for 228,000 being given, payable thirty days after
the recognition of the Southern Confederacy. The result of this
proceeding was that on the return voyage the Ariel did not bring the
specie from Aspinwall, and the Federal Government had sent a
war-steamer to fetch it. The West India mail brings us further
intelligence of the doings of the Alabama. Captain Semmes had captured
an American barque, laden with provisions, and after having taken on
board his own ship so much of her cargo as he deemed necessary, he set
fire to the vessel. He had also seized a Federal schooner, but as her
cargo was the property of British subjects she was allowed to proceed
upon the Captain signing a bond to pay a certain sum of money to the
Confederate Government at the close of the war.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Career of the Alabama.</hi>--(To the
Editor.)--Will you grant me space to correct a few of the many errors
contained in Mr. S. M. Underhill's communication to the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi>
referring to the Confederate steamer Alabama, a copy of which appeared
in your columns on Saturday last? 1. She was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> built under contract
with a Mr. Butcher. 2. Her engines are not by Penn, of London, but by
Laird, of Birkenhead. 3. She did not, after leaving Birkenhead, steam
directly to the island to the Atlantic, &#x0026;c., but passed a day and two
nights in Moelfra Bay, on the coast of Wales, taking in there a
portion of her crew, bonded stores, &#x0026;c. 4. Her destination was not
"Tarissa," wherever that may be, but Terceira, one of the
Azores. 5. She was never commanded by a Captain Bullock. The gentleman
who took charge of her from the time she left the stocks till she was
delivered into the hands of Captain Semmes, of the Confederate navy,
was Captain M. J. Butcher, R.N.R.  6. The Alabama had no English papers
to prove her neutrality; in fact, she carried no papers
whatever. 7. She was not visited daily by large parties of the
inhabitants of "Tarissa," or Terceira. Once only (on the 22nd of
August) a party of about seventy persons, chiefly officials, paid
the vessel a visit.--A.B., Hull, Jan. 12, 1863.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 17,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">Had</hi> the proclamation with which the President of the Northern
States of America has inaugurated the New Year been issued under other
circumstances than those which unhappily attend it, there is not a
journal in the United Kingdom but would have given that document the
place of honour, and have introduced it with the warmest words of
congratulation, the most honest utterances of rejoicing, which it is
permitted to the pen to express. The President has proclaimed instant
freedom to the American slaves would have been an announcement to set
all hearts beating joyfully, and to call out a long exulting shout
from British freemen. We should have set our bells ringing, and have
kindled our fires</p>
<q><p rend="center">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to
Milford Bay.</p></q>

<p>For, let a few calumniators write as they will, the people of
England have ever been of one mind upon the slavery question. They are
as stanch and resolved in their hatred of the domestic institution as
when we abolished the accursed slave traffic; as when, at a vast
sacrifice, both of money and of colonial prosperity, we struck the
last fetter from the last English slave; as when the women of England,
half a million strong, sent out a generous if not a wise remonstrance
to the women of America. We detest the system, and every attempt to
palliate its wickedness or to defend those who are its friends by any
argument based on principle is offensive to the right-thinking people
of this country. We repeat that, had this proclamation been issued in
time of peace, and as the deliberate resolve of the Government of the
United States, the day on which we write, or some day that would have
been instantly and gleefully fixed, would have been kept as high
holiday in England, and the next mail would have gone out heavily
laden with our sincerest congratulations to our American brethren upon
their having given the deathblow to a cruel and blasphemous
system. Our churches would have<pb n="63"/> resounded with thanksgivings of a
still higher kind, and we should have rendered grateful homage to
Providence for having strengthened a kindred nation to wipe away a
stain upon humanity.</p>

<p>Even as it is, and in spite of the fact that for all practical
purposes the proclamation is a sham, the words cannot be read without
emotion. The President decrees freedom to the slaves in ten
States. But the more we should have rejoiced had the measure been one
of peaceful civilisation the more bitter is the feeling that the
document was prompted only for the embarrassment of an enemy, and that
it will be in most instances a <hi rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi>, while perhaps in others
it may bring on melancholy results. It is not the Government of
America that issues this proclamation, but the chief of certain States
that are seeking empire over others. The document is no noble State
paper, the crowning of a deliberate and generous policy, but an
experiment designed to help on a disastrous and unjustifiable war. It
is simply an attempt to explode a mine under the feet of those upon
whom cannon have thundered in vain. The President of the North, if he
believes that his proclamation will take effect, is in the position of
a soldier who employs some new and barbarous method of exterminating
his antagonists. Could the notification really effect what some of the
Abolitionists profess to desire, the savages who poison wells, the
miscreants who leave poisoned stores behind them, are humane and
civilised enemies in comparison to these who sign and publish this
document. But we will not believe that the Abolitionist doctrine is
that of Mr. Lincoln, who has always been accounted a kindly, if coarse
and shortsighted, man. He does not think that his notice that the
slaves are free will set four millions of revengeful Africans firing,
plundering, and slaying; but he probably does hope that he will
embarrass the Confederate Generals; and, moreover, he has obeyed the
dictates of the powerful faction that has hitherto made him its tool,
to the eternal detriment of the once mighty Republic which he was
elected to govern.</p>

<p>Yet it is impossible not to feel a great and a new anxiety while we
await information as to the results of this step. The President, true
to his feeble character, hesitated to the last, and did not issue the
proclamation until the second of the month. That the Confederates knew
that it had been finally resolved upon may be assumed as certain, and
it is equally so that they will have taken the most determined means
to meet it. Indeed, the counter-proclamation of President Davis,
though ostensibly and mainly directed against a man who had been
recalled before the Southern document was issued, is intended as a
repressive agency. Mr. Lincoln tells the slave that he is free, and
that he may take arms for what is curiously called his country;
Mr. Davis tells him that if he is taken in arms the officers under
whom he serves shall be liable to suffer death, and that he himself
shall be handed over to the tender mercies of the State to which he
belongs; and the slave knows what that means, and would, if captured,
gladly compound for the more merciful doom decreed to his white
officer. All this is truly horrible, and even if none of the fearful
revenge thus menaced shall be taken, America will be glad hereafter to
tear from her history the pages in which such documents are
preserved--to destroy such evidences that the boasted advance of
education and civilisation had done so little for her nations that
they had recourse in war time to menaces of indiscriminate
massacre. But we doubt not that the President of the Southern States
has done more than issue this proclamation. He has caused it to be
understood wherever there is a negro who can carry arms. The Lincoln
proclamation will have been kept out of the Slave States as much as
possible, but Mr. Davis will not rely upon any such precaution. He
knows that the Abolitionists are active and skilful, that they have a
complex "underground" agency in the South, and that they will use
every effort to make the negroes aware of the Washington manifesto. It
will he impossible to prevent its coming to the knowledge of thousands
of slaves. But we mistake the stern character of the Confederate
authorities if they have not made preparations for dealing in the most
terrible manner with the first Africans who may take advantage of
Mr. Lincoln's verbal enfranchisement of the race. The Abolitionist may
have cause to shudder at the example that will be made of those whom
they have excited into an attempt to defy soldiers flushed with four
great victories over the North.</p>

<p>But, on consideration, we are inclined to retain our conviction&#x2014;
which is, in all probability, Mr. Lincoln's (we hope so)--that if the
slaves were to be moved by his documents they would have been moved
much sooner. They showed no signs of insurrection, so far as we know,
when their masters were weak; they now know that their masters are
strong and victorious, and it is improbable that the black man's
inclination to rise will be increased by the news which he has been
receiving for the last year. Still, there may be some slaves who may
believe that their hour has come; and if there are, whether they are
victors or vanquished, such things will be done as will make even the
Abolitionists shudder. Regarded, therefore, at the very best--that is,
as a mere sacrifice to the petulance of a faction--this proclamation is
contemptible; but if we look at it in another light, and believe that
it is intended to do what the sword failed to accomplish, we dare
hardly trust ourselves with expressions that would fittingly signify
our sense of the wickedness.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> is not often that people make us
pecuniary presents; but happening to be the other day in Paris with a
Northern-American friend--a "Black Republican," <hi rend="italic">pur
sang</hi>--he made us a New-Year's gift of a bank-note.  It bore
neither the honoured signature of the cashiers of the Bank of England
nor France; but it was, nevertheless, a legitimate public security,
immediately convertible--in its native land <hi rend="italic">bien

much liked to engrave this note for the <hi rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London News</hi>, but, failing the burin,
the pen must serve out turn.  Imagine, then, a diminutive
parallelogram of yellow, gritty paper two inches long, by an inch and
a quarter broad, containing in the centre a medallion portrait of
George Washington, with the numeral "5," on either side, and the
initials "U.S." beneath. Within an elaborately-executed border, the
following inscription appeared:--"Postage currency.  Furnished only by
the assistant-treasurers and designated depositories of the United
States.  Receivable for postage-stamps at any post office."  The back
bore a larger medallion, with a fat "5," surrounded by twelve smaller
ones.  The value of this bank or governmental postage note was five
cents, or twopence halfpenny sterling.</p>

<p>As we fingered the queer little coupon our thoughts reverted to the
revolutionary assignats current during the Reign of Terror, and which
were sold until recently, as curiosities, by the old man who kept the
printstall beneath the portcullised arch at the Biblioth&#xE8;que Imp&#xE9;rial,
in the Rue Richelieu.  And then we recalled to mind the fourpenny and
sixpenny notes which were issued in Austria in the troublous days of
'48, to say nothing of the innumerable "shinplasters," "bogus," and
"wild-cat" notes emitted in the various American crises, and our own
tradesman's tokens, one-pound notes.  Likewise did a certain Russian
rouble note present itself to our memory--a note given us in change by
an hotel-keeper, and so greasy, or rotten, and so tattered that it was
ensconced in a pasteboard frame for safety.  After all, we thought,
"money is money;" and so long as the Federal Government forbears to
apply the sponge to its obligations a pocket-book full of these little
postage parallelograms is as valuable in degree as a bundle of the
crispest "fivers" that Mr. Ferraby or Mr. Gattie ever signed, or as a
portemonnaie overflowing with napoleons and gold eagles.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE OF FREDERICKSBURG.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">To</hi> the account of this great battle, from
a Federal point of view, already given in this Journal, we add a
description of it taken from a Confederate standpoint.  The Southern
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> sends from General Lee's head-quarters the
following particulars of the Battle of Fredericksburg:--</p>

<q><p>The morning of the 13th of December--a memorable day to the
historian of the Decline and Fall of the American Republic--broke
still and warm, while, as on the preceding day, a thick haze enveloped
the town of Fredericksburg and the circumjacent valley, and delayed
the opening of the fire by the antagonistic batteries until the sun
had been up some three hours.  It was strange to contrast
Saturday, the 13th of September, with Saturday, the 6th, and to
compare the intense cold of the earlier Saturday with the spring-like
warmth and calmness of the later.  The day which I am describing was
one of those outbursts of that Indian summer which lingers long and
fondly in beautiful Virginia; the morning haze which shrouded heath,
and plain, and forest, was the ordinary prelude to the warmth and glow
of the sun at noonday.  As the fog lifted about ten in the morning,
and the sun burst through the clouds, the long lines of the Federal
Army, which had passed the whole preceding day in deploying and
preparing for the attack, were distinctly visible in the plain, and
gave awful indications of the amount of the Federal host which had
crossed the river.  The Confederate army, wholly undaunted by the
extravagant stories about the strength of their foe, waited calmly,
drawn up for the most part within the fringe of the woods, confident
in their position and in the valour which has never failed them.  And
here it may be as well finally to dispel those illusions under which
it is the custom of the Northern press to veil the disgrace of defeat,
when the fact itself admits of no denial.  The whole number of
Confederates in the field this day did not exceed from 80,000 to
90,000 men.  Of these, some 25,000 men, taking the very highest
estimate, took part in the fight.</p>

<p>It is impossible for me to describe the positions of each of the
numerous Confederate batteries which stretched along the length of
their six-mile line of battle.  It will suffice if I indicate the
batteries which were most hotly engaged, and bore the brunt of the
action.  By far the most important position was occupied by the
Washington Artillery, commanded by Colonel Walton, of New Orleans, and
posted on the heights in the immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg,
not more than 400 yards from the town.  These heights, which are
precisely of that altitude which is most favourable for the play of
artillery, are surmounted by a brick house, now riddled by round
shot, belonging to Mr. Marye, and are commonly called Marye's
Heights.  At their base a road winds, protected on one side by the
hills and on the other by a solid stone wall, about four feet in
height, over which a brigade of Confederates, themselves perfectly
sheltered, poured the deadliest and most effective of fires.  A little
further back, to the south-east of Marye's Heights, stands another and
higher hill, from which the most commanding view of the entire field
is obtainable, and which, as it is the usual station of the
Commander-in-Chief, is now known as General Lee's hill. From this
hill during a large portion of Saturday a 30-pounder Parrott gun, cast
at the Tredegar Works, in Richmond, poured a destructive fire into the
Federals.  Suddenly, about three in the afternoon, on its
thirty-seventh discharge, this gun burst with a dreadful explosion,
but happily did no injury to any of the bystanders.  At the moment of
its explosion Captain Phillips, of the Grenadier Guards (favourably
remarked this day for his behaviour under fire), Major Venables, of
General Lee's Staff, and Major Haskell were conversing within a few
feet of the gun.  Their escape without injury was little less than
miraculous.  As the Confederate line trends away to the right, the
batteries of General Hood's division were actively engaged against the
advancing columns of Pennsylvanians; but, next to the batteries on
Marye's Heights and General Lee's hill[,] I should say that the
artillery commanded by Colonel Walker took the most effective part in
the action, as it poured a flanking fire into the enemy's left.  One
other battery deserves a favourable mention, which it obtained in the
short and modest report of the battle which emanates from the pen of
General Lee.  On the extreme right of the Confederates, in front of the
position occupied by General Stuart's cavalry, a few batteries of
Stuart's Horse Artillery were thrown forward, to flank the Federals,
between Walker's Artillery and the river.  General Stuart ordered
Major John Pelham, his Chief of Artillery, to advance one gun
considerably towards the enemy, and to open upon him.  Major Pelham
obeyed, and opened the fire of a 12-pounder Napoleon gun with great
precision and deadly effect into the Federal flank.  The galling
discharges of this gun quickly drew upon it the fire of three
Federal field batteries, while, from across the river, two other heavy
batteries joined in the strife and made Major Pelham and his gun their
target.  For hours not less than thirty Federal cannon strove to
silence Major Pelham's popgun, and strove in vain.  The unyielding and
undemonstrative courage of Major Pelham, his composure under the
deadliest fire, have long made him conspicuous, but never were his
noble qualities subject of more glowing eulogy than upon this
occasion.  General Lee exclaimed, "It is inspiriting to see such
glorious courage in one so young."  (Major Pelham is not more than
twenty-two); General Jackson remarked, "With a Pelham upon either
flank I could vanquish the world."</p>

<p>At half-past eight a.m. General Lee, accompanied by his full Staff,
rode slowly along the front of the Confederate lines from the left to
right, and took up his station for a time beyond Hamilton's Crossing,
and in rear of the batteries on the extreme Confederate right.  It
would be presumptuous in me to say one word in commendation of the
serenity, or, if I may so express it, the unconscious dignity of
General Lee's courage when he is under fire.  No one who sees and
knows his demeanour in ordinary life would expect anything else from
one so calm, so undemonstrative, and unassuming.  But the description
applied after the battle of Alma to Lord Raglan by Marshal
St. Arnaud, and in which, noticing Lord Raglan's unconsciousness
under fire, he speaks of his "antique heroism," seems to me so
applicable to General Lee that I cannot forbear recalling it here.  At
a subsequent period of the day General Lee assumed his station on the
hill which takes its name from him, and thence, in company with
General Longstreet, calmly watched the repulse of the repeated Federal
efforts against the heights on which he stood.  Occasionally General
Jackson rode up to the spot and mingled in conversation with the
other two leading Generals.  Once General Longstreet exclaimed to him,
"Are you not scared by that file of Yankees you have before you down
there?" to which General Jackson replied, "Wait till they come a
little nearer, and they shall either scare me or I'll scare them."</p>

<p>The battle opened when the sun had let in enough light through the
mist to disclose the near proximity of the Federal lines and field
batteries.  The first shot was fired shortly before ten a.m. from the
batteries in the Federal centre, and was directed against General
Hood's division.  The Pennsylvanian Reserves advanced boldly under a
heavy fire against the Confederates, who occupied one of the copsewood
spurs, and were for a time permitted to hold it, but presently the
Confederate batteries opened on them, and a determined charge of the
Texans drove the Yankees out of the wood in a confusion from which
nothing could subsequently rally them.  Simultaneously a heavy fire
issued from the batteries of General A. P. Hill's and General Early's
divisions, which was vigorously replied to by the Federal field
batteries.  The only advantage momentarily gained by the Federals in
this quarter, and which is noticed in General Lee's report, was on the
occasion of the collapse of a regiment of North Carolina conscripts,
who broke and ran, but whose place was rapidly taken by more intrepid
successors.  The cannonading now became general along the entire line.
Such a scene, at once terrific and sublime, mortal eye never rested on
before, unless the bombardment of Sebastopol by the combined batteries
of France and England revealed a more fearful manifestation of the
hate and fury of man.  The thundering, bellowing roar of hundreds of
pieces of artillery, the bright jets of issuing flame--the screaming,
hissing, whistling, shrieking projectiles--<pb n="81"/>the wreaths of smoke, as
shell after shell burst into the still air, the savage <sic corr="cash"> ca sh</sic> of
roundshot among the trees of the shattered forest, formed a scene
likely to sink for ever into the memory of all who witnessed it, but
utterly defying verbal delineation. A direct and enfilading fire swept
each battery upon either side as it was unmasked, volley replied to
volley, crash succeeded crash, until the eye lost all power of
distinguishing the lines of combatants, and the whole plain seemed a
lake of fire, a seething mass of molten lava, coursed over by
incarnate fiends drunk with fury and revenge.</p>

<p>Twice the Federals, gallantly led and encouraged by their officers,
dashed against the forces of General A. P. Hill and General Early, and
twice they recoiled, broken and discomfited, and incapable of being
again rallied to the fray. The eager Confederates drove them with
horrid carnage a mile across the plain, and only desisted from the
pursuit when they came under the fire of the Federal batteries across
the river. Upon the extreme Confederate right General Stuart's Horse
Artillery pressed hotly upon the fugitives, and kept up a fire,
subsequently understood to have been very effective, until after
dark. Upon the Confederate right, where the antagonists fought upon
more level terms, the equality of loss upon both sides was greater
than on the Confederate left; but even here the Federal loss in
officers and men far outnumbered that of their opponents. General
Bayard, the best cavalry officer in the Federal service, fell dead
almost on the eve of the day which was to have witnessed his
nuptials. General Jackson, of Pennsylvania, shared his fate. Many
other general officers were carried to the Federal rear grievously
wounded; whereas of the Confederates only one officer of rank--General
Gregg--fell upon the right, and only one--General Cobb--upon the
left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the battle which had dashed furiously against the lines
of Generals Hood, A. P. Hill, and Early, was little more than child's
play as compared with the onslaught directed by the Federals in the
immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg. The impression that the
Confederate batteries would not fire heavily upon the Federals
advancing in this quarter, for fear of injuring the town of
Fredericksburg, is believed to have prevailed among the Northern
Generals. How bitterly they deceived themselves subsequent events
served to show. To the Irish division, commanded by General Meagher,
was principally committed the desperate task of bursting out of the
town of Fredericksburg and forming, under the withering fire of the
Confederate batteries, to attack Marye's Heights, lowering immediately
in their front. Never at Fontenoy, at Albuera, or at Waterloo was more
undoubted courage displayed by the sons of Erin than during those six
frantic dashes which they directed against the almost impregnable
position of their foe.</p>

<p>That any mortal men could have carried the position before which
they were wantonly sacrificed, defended as it was, it seems to me idle
for a moment to believe; but the bodies which lie in dense masses
within forty yards of the muzzles of Colonel Walton's guns are the
best evidence what manner of men they were who pressed on to death
with the dauntlessness of a race which has gained glory on a thousand
battlefields, and never more richly deserved it than at the foot of
Marye's Heights on the 13th day of December, 1862.</p>

<p>An opportunity of sending this letter, with an encouraging
prospect of its reaching England, compels me to defer a further
account of the gallant defence on the Confederate left of the town of
Fredericksburg and of the battlefield until a subsequent letter.</p></q></div2>

<p>The struggle before Murfreesboro', in Tennessee, ended--after a
five days' struggle and severe slaughter on both sides--in the retreat
of<pb n="87"/> the Confederates, during the night of the 3rd inst., to
Sullahoma, thirty miles distant, on the line of the Nashville and
Chattanooga Railway. The Federal General Rosencranz has occupied
Murfreesboro', but was not able to pursue General Bragg's army, which
retired in good order. The Federals acknowledge a loss of 1000 killed
and 5500 wounded--of several thousand prisoners and 23 pieces of
artillery. Generals Willich and Fry are among the prisoners. The
Confederate loss is estimated at 4500 killed and wounded and 1000
prisoners. Twenty negro teamsters, surprised in the rear of the Federal
army by the Confederate cavalry, were immediately shot by their
captors.</p>

<p>Five thousand Federal cavalry have made a raid from Kentucky into
East Tennessee, and destroyed nine miles of the East Tennessee and
Virginia Railroad, near Knoxville, thus preventing reinforcements from
Richmond reaching General Bragg.</p>

<p>Despatches from General Grant to General Halleck report that
General Sullivan defeated the Confederates under General Forrest, at
Lexington, Tennessee, on the 1st inst., capturing six cannons and many
prisoners. The Confederate loss in killed and wounded is put down at
1400 men, and that of the Federals at 800.</p>

<p>General Sherman invested Vicksburg, in the Lower Mississippi, with
40,000 men, Commodore Farragut's gun-boats co-operating. The fighting
lasted five days, with varying success. The Federals fought their way
to within two miles of the city, capturing three lines of works, when
they were assailed by fresh forces under General Joe Johnston. After a
hand-to-hand fight, the Federals were driven back to their first line
of defence, with the loss of General Morgan and 3000 men. The
Confederates have concentrated their forces from Jackson and Grenada
at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The celebrated iron-clad Monitor, the first-born of Mr. Ericsson's
military genius, sprang a leak, while off Cape Hatteras, on the 31st.,
and sank. The Monitor was being towed by the steamer Rhode Island,
which succeeded in saving a portion of the officers and crew. Five
officers and nineteen men belonging to the two vessels were lost. One
theory of her loss is that the sea rushed down her turret.</p>

<p>At New Orleans General Banks had released 112 State prisoners
sentenced by General Butler. He had also issued an order permitting
the clergy of New Orleans to resume their functions under certain
restrictions.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the officers of the Kentucky regiments had
sent in their resignations in consequence of the issue of
Mr. Lincoln's latest proclamation. The volunteers from this State
share the sentiments of their officers.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>General Halleck has rescinded the order of General Grant excluding
all Jews from his department.</p>

<p>General Butler had arrived at Washington, and dined with
Mr. Seward. He was also the object of a popular manifestation in his
favour at the National Hotel.</p>

<p>The large hall of the Cooper Institute, New York, was crowded on
the 5th inst. to its fullest capacity by an audience of white and
coloured people of both sexes to celebrate the Emancipation
Proclamation. Representatives of the European, African, and mulatto
races occupied the platform. Speeches were made by the
Rev. Dr. Cheever, Lewis Tappan, and the Rev. Mr. Denison of the white
race; and by the Rev. H. H. Garnet, the Rev. J.S. Raymond, Professor
W. J. Brown, the Rev. Mr. Kane, and other speakers of the African or
mixed races.</p>

<p>The returns of the annual immigration at the port of New York show
that the number of immigrants was 76,000, or 15,000 more than in
1861. The German immigration exceeded the Irish in 1862. That from
England follows third.</p>

<p>Owing chiefly to the astonishing and sudden development of the
American grain trade with Europe, 1862 was a peculiarly favourable
year to the interests of American railroads and canals. The New York
canals, which only earned 900,000 dols. surplus revenues in 1858, paid
over to the State which owns them 4,000 000 dols. in 1862. The
principal lines of railroad have paid higher dividends than during the
former years of peace. Some of them, as the New York and Erie, and
Illinois Central railroads, which either never paid, or long since
ceased to pay, dividends, commenced to pay them in 1862.</p>

<p>Gold has risen to 36 per cent premium.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Governor Seymour's
Message.</hi></p>

<p>The message of the newly-elected Democratic Governor of the State
of New York was delivered to the Legislature on the 7th. He says, when
commenting on national affairs:--</p>
<q><p>The truths of the financial and military situation must not be
kept back.  There must be no attempt to put down free expression of
public opinion. Affrighted at the ruin they have wrought, the authors
of our calamities, North and South, insist that it was caused by an
unavoidable contest about slavery. This has been the subject, not the
cause, of the controversy. We are to look for the causes of the war in
the pervading disregard of obligations of laws and constitutions, in
disrespect for constituted authority; above all, in the local
prejudices which have grown up in the two portions of the Atlantic
States at the two extremes of our country. There is no honest
statement of our difficulties which does not teach that our people
must reform themselves as well as the conduct of the Government and
the policy of our rulers. It is not too late to save the country if we
will enter upon our sacred duty in a right spirit and in the right
way. When we do, the effect will be soon felt throughout the land and
by the civilised world. We shall then strengthen the Government,
weaken the rebellion, and unite our people; and the world will
recognise our capacity for self-government when we show that we are
capable of self reform.</p></q>
<p>The Governor condemns the exercise of martial power as destructive
of the rights of States and of the judicial and legislative powers of
the general Government. He declares the President's proclamation to
be</p>

<q><p>Impolitic, unjust, and unconstitutional; calculated to raise
many barriers to the restoration of the Union; likely to be
misconstrued by the world as an abandonment of the hope of restoring
it--a result to which New York is nobly opposed, and which will be
effectually resisted. The Union will be restored by the Central and
Western States, both free and slave, who are exempt from the violent
passions which bear control at the extremes. Those central Slave
States which rejected the ordinance of secession, which sought to
remain in the Union, and which were driven away by a contemptuous and
uncompromising policy, must be brought back. The National
Constitution must be held inviolate, and the rights of States must be
respected as not less sacred. A consolidated Government would destroy
the home rights and liberties of the people. The suppression of
journals and the imprisonment of persons have been glaringly
partisan.</p></q>

<p>The Governor contends that though the seceded States may have
forfeited their right to appeal to the Constitution, not a single
right of the people of the loyal States can be suspended. He denies
that the civil war in the South takes away from the people of the
loyal North the benefits of one principle of civil liberty. He
promises support to the armies in the field, and obedience to all the
constitutional demands of the general Government. Under no
circumstances can the division of the Union be conceded.</p></div2>

24,1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whatever</hi> may be the strategic value of the
recent operations in America, there can be no doubt that they will
have moral weight, and we could almost wish that the success of the
Federals had been more marked, inasmuch as there might then be more
hope of their being brought to relinquish a useless and hopeless
war. It might be too much to expect that a high spirited people,
accustomed to vaunt its superiority over Creation generally, would be
inclined to listen to any terms for pacification while four
unmistakable defeats were unbalanced by any proof that the North could
fight well. Though we believe that nearly all, except professional
politicians and others, whose profits lie in the continuance of the
struggle, have ceased to speak of the reconstruction of the Union as
one of the objects of the war, we have no right to blame the dogged
obstinacy with which the Federals insist on going on with it until
they can find opportunity for a decorous "rest in the accounts."
Nobody likes to be completely defeated, and many a man who has
privately made up his mind that he is so will cling to his adversary,
and struggle, and wrangle, rather than accept the situation. A small
success will often serve him as an excuse for retiring, flushed and
angry, and declaring that he should have gained the day but for a
chain of accidents which took the strife out of the lists of fair
play. We have no right to expect the Americans to rise superior to
human nature; nobody but themselves ever supposed them at such a moral
altitude, and Englishmen have been ready to make every allowance for
exacerbated and discomfited men. But this Murfreesboro' business,
although we lack accurate details of it, has shown that the Federals,
if decently led, can fight as well as their antagonists, and can
almost gain a victory. The battle was protracted and sanguinary; but,
let the Confederates make the very best of it, they had to abandon the
field. The affair must count on the Federal side; and we repeat that
we are inclined to hope that this will be placed beyond dispute by the
despatches, because mediation might then address itself to the victors
with a good chance of being listened to with something<pb n="91"/> more than
tolerance. We should like to be able to say to the North that it had
at length vindicated its military character, and might now be expected
to show that it was governed by reason, and was prepared to abandon an
attempt at impossible coercion.</p>

<p>We do not for a moment contend that the time has come for England
to say this. Our Government may or may not be more inclined than
heretofore to reconsider the situation, but it is impossible to say,
just now, what our Government thinks. Mr. Gladstone has said his say
upon the American question, and believes that the South is a nation;
while his colleague, Mr. Milner Gibson, assures his constituents that
the North is winning, because it occupies more territory than it did
in the earlier stage of secession. We may hear a third voice, of more
potency, in the course of the next three weeks; but, on the whole, it
would seem that the Premier does not believe that the time has come
for any general European demonstration against the continuance of the
war.</p>

<p>But we must call attention to another phase of the question. It is
one which the journalist has watched for some time, and it is
creditable to the reticence and discretion of the British press that
no irritating use has been made of the facts. There can, however, be
no object now in disguising the truth, which is, that France has
become an object of both dislike and apprehension on the part of the
Federals. It is not many months since such a state of things would
have seemed impossible. It had ever been the habit with the Americans
to speak of the French as the most advanced nation of the Old World,
to heap adulation upon the wisdom of the Emperor Napoleon, and to
profess a sort of belief that one day France and the Republic might,
in union, direct the destinies of the world. It is not now worth
inquiring how far these sentiments were dictated by what Sir Philip
Francis calls the only excuse for flattery--namely, the <hi rend="italic">odium
tertii</hi>. Whether England was the third party who was so hateful that it
was pleasant to flatter her supposed enemy, is now beside the
question. The case was so, and the Emperor had a right to believe that
his influence was very powerful in the North. It is gone, and the
Emperor knows that it is gone, and does not trouble himself to
disguise that knowledge. The journals of the North have for some time
been full of taunts and sneers at the Tuileries, and these expressions
of feeling have lately deepened into downright abuse, and even
menace. The Emperor is told that he is "found out," and is warned that
it is not for a despot (the discovery of whose despotism is curiously
coincident with the establishment of another) to interfere with the
will of a great and free nation. He is told that his attempt at
drawing England into a joint mediation was an "insolence," and England
herself is actually praised for having been too "deep" for the Sphinx
of Paris. He is further assured that, should he presume to interfere
further, and especially should he give the slightest sign of using
other than moral force, he will be suddenly confronted by a tremendous
coalition. As the constituents of this coalition might not be easily
guessed, we had better say that it is to consist of Russia, England,
Spain, and the Federals, and that it is to replace upon the throne of
France the house whose Princes fought so nobly for Republican
institutions. We are simply reproducing the language of various
Northern papers, and those who are unfortunately obliged to peruse
such publications will testify to the accuracy of our statements.</p>

<p>The Emperor of the French does not appear to be very much terrified
by this fearful programme, or, if he is, he continues to practise the
art of veiling his alarms. He continues to treat mediation as a thing
to be attempted again as soon as opportunity shall serve; but, without
insisting too much upon this, he orders the publication of a document
in which he distinctly enunciates his intention of opposing the force
of France to what is not very properly called the Monroe doctrine. The
despatch to General Forey is about as significant a document as need
be, and it lays down as part of the Imperial policy a resolve to
repress American ascendency in America.  And, as Sir Walter Scott says
of another Louis of France, "he is just the man to give a lively
colour to his avowal by following it up by an execution." The Mexican
expedition, largely reinforced, is going to work in thorough earnest;
the capital is to be seized at all cost; and perhaps the occupation of
Rome may be paralleled by an occupation of Mexico that will "protect"
the throne of the Incas against all comers, especially such as come
from any part of the American Continent. The gauntlet is fairly flung
to all who cry "America for the Americans;" and it may be an
additional reason against an attempt to reconstitute the Union that
the first step of the new State must in honour be an armed protest
against French action, or the swagger of twenty years is even more
vain than it was believed to be.</p>

<p>In noting the history of the war, therefore, we may observe that it
has called into existence a new element of opposition to the extension
of American "Empire;" and, although at the present moment this may not
seem so important a fact as it is, the fact will be a very grave one
when the time comes, as come it must, for settling by treaty the
principle of the Partition of America. Into how many portions the vast
continent will be divided it is now impossible to say, but it is quite
clear that France proposes to erect barriers against the unity of the
continent.</p></div2>

<p>...And so the far-famed Monitor has gone to the bad! But a few months
have passed since the <hi rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London News</hi>
contained an Engraving of the momentous fight in Hampton Roads,
depicting both the Merrimac and the Monitor--the ironclad that
destroyed a fleet, and the ironclad that saved one. And now, of the
two monsters of the deep--the Federal and Confederate Kilkenny
cats--not so much as a tail, by way of vestige, remains. The Merrimac,
indeed, committed suicide; but the Monitor was the victim of sudden
death. An aqueous apoplexy overtook her off Cape Hatteras; she sprang
a leak; pumps were in vain; she became waterlogged, and went down like
a stone. We are reminded of the warrior clad in Milan steel, who, as
Guicciardini tells us, in one of the Italian civil wars of the middle
ages, was ingulfed, horse, iron panoply and all, by mere force of
gravitation, in a morass, and was the only man killed in the
particular battle in question. There was an English Earl of Sandwich,
too, Admiral and General at Sea, who, venturing in a small boat during
a naval engagement, was drowned by the weight of his armour.</p>
 
<p>Old tars of the Benbow school, nay, old landsmen, amateurs of Dibdin's songs,
and believers in the sole efficacy of wooden walls, will doubtless rub
their hands and chuckle at the catastrophes which have overtaken the
two model ironclads of America. The "floating flat-irons," the "hogs
in armour," have certainly come to signal grief. Ay, but they were not
constructed on the lines of the Warrior or the Gloire; and if the
American wise men of Gotham will go to sea in a bowl covered with
railway iron, they must expect dangerous squalls. Once upon a time, we
saw the late Mr. Tom Barry, clown at Astley's, floating on the bosom
of the Thames in a washing-tub drawn by two geese; but the pantomimic
navigator would scarcely have ventured upon a trip to the Bay of
Biscay in his eccentric craft. After all, the science of naval
construction in metal is in its infancy, and will be liable to error
and mishap for some time to came. A gentleman calling upon Beau
Brummell one morning met his valet coming down stairs with an armful
of crumpled white neckcloths. "These are our failures, Sir," the
gentleman's gentleman explained, when interrogated. The Beau had only
spoilt a couple of dozen cravats before he found one to suit him. In
like manner armour-plating in naval architecture must, we suppose,
have its "failures" before the golden mean, or the iron one, is
found.</p></div2>

will be interested in reading the concluding lines of the judgment
given by Judge Read:--"The first president of this society was the
originator of the first fire company, the first public library, the

Pennsylvania; a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Minister to
France, one of our Ministers Plenipotentiary who signed the

the Constitution of the United States. This was Dr. Benjamin Franklin,
the patriot and the philosopher; and I cannot but express a confident
hope that the city and the state of which he was so distinguished an
ornament will never permit the hands of the taxgatherer to diminish
the fund devoted to the interests of science in every part of the
world, both in peace and in war, and belonging to a society of which
be was the founder."</p></div2>

<p>There has been no movement on the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>The Federal Colonel Cheseret reports that he had posted the
emancipation proclamation on the walls of Winchester, Virginia, and
scattered it among the farms. The proclamation was depopulating the
region between the Rappahannock and the Potomac of the slaves owned
there.</p>

<p>General Hunter, formerly superseded for his Abolitionism, has been
appointed to the command of the Department of the South.</p>

<p>General Bragg has been superseded in the command of the Confederate
force in Tennessee by General Longstreet. The Confederates estimate
their loss at Murfreesboro' at 9000.</p>

<p>On their retreat, after the unsuccessful attack on Vicksburg, the
Federal gun-boats proceeded up the Arkansas River. On the 11th they
assailed Arkansas post, 100 miles up the stream. The post was defended
by 7000 men, who, being attacked in front and rear, surrendered
unconditionally, after a short and sharp struggle and a loss of 550
killed and wounded. The Federal loss is reported at 200 killed and
wounded. General Sherman had been superseded by General M'Clernand,
who was about to proceed up the White River.</p>

<p>Despatches from Springfield, Missouri, state that the Confederates
were repulsed in their attack upon the town, and retired, leaving a
portion of their killed and wounded on the field.</p>

<p>Reports have been received of further depredations by the Alabama
in the West Indies. She captured two vessels in Mona Passage, one of
them, the Parker, of Boston, was destroyed; the other, the Union, from
Baltimore, was released. The cargo was not touched, being owned by
British subjects.</p>

<p>Galveston, the chief port of Texas, has been retaken by the
Confederate. On the 1st inst. five Confederate steamers, armed with
guns, protected by cotton bales, with troops on board, attacked the
Federal gun-boats and captured the gun-boat Harriet Lane. Her officers
and nearly all her crew had been killed by musketry. Two Federal
gun-boats escaped. The Federals blew up their flagship, Commodore
Renshaw accidentally perishing on board. The remainder of the Federal
fleet and troops returned to New Orleans. The Harriet Lane was
strongly armed, and will be a valuable acquisition to the nearly
extinct Confederate navy. The Confederates were commanded by General
Magruder. He claims to have taken about 600 prisoners, and valuable
stores, arms, &#x0026;c. Six Federal vessels have left New Orleans to
recapture the Harriet Lane and to destroy the Confederate gun-boats at
Bayou Buffalo, in Galveston Bay.</p>

<p>The Confederates are said to have executed ten Federal officers in
Arkansas, in retaliation for the acts of General M'Neil.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Whig</hi> states that the Federal
officers captured at Murfreesboro' will be confined until General
Butler be given up to the Confederate Government.</p>

<p>The Louisiana State Capitol at B&#xE2;ton Rouge has been burnt, with all
its contents. The perpetrators of this act of vandalism are
unknown.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>Twenty-six Republican members of the Senate, forming a clear
majority of that body, have presented a memorial to the President
expressing a want of confidence in the Administration. They assert
that the President is not aided by a Cabinet agreeing with him in
political principles and general policy, and urge him to such changes
as will secure a unity of purpose and action. They also admonish him
that it is unwise and unsafe to intrust any important military
operation to any officer who is not a cordial supporter of the
Government.</p><pb n="111"/>

<p>A bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives for the
enlistment of 150,000 negro troops. The resolution to lay the bill
upon the table was defeated by 83 to 53.</p>

<p>Mr. Spaulding, the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means in
the House of Representatives, has explained the financial situation of
the Government. He said that the Government needed immediately
150,000,000 dols. All the gold and silver in the banks of the loyal
States was 87,000,000 dols. Bonds could not be sold. 1,117,000,000
dols. were required, in addition to the receipts from the customs and
taxes, to carry on the Government until July, 1854. It is necessary to
borrow, in some form, 1,900,000 dols. every day, Sundays included,
between this time and the 1st of next July. Mr. Spaulding declared
that the only hope of success in financial schemes depended upon
military success. Congress has passed a bill for the issue of 100,000,000 dols. in legal-tender notes. The Missouri Emancipation Aid Bill,
which proposed an appropriation of 10,000,000 dols., has been reported
back by the Judiciary Committee, with a recommendation that it be
increased to 20,000,000 dols.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Davis's Message.</hi></p>

<p>President Davis's Message has been sent in to the Confederate
Congress. He complains<lb/> that the European Powers declared neutrality
without acknowledging the sovereignty of the seceded States; thus
injuring the South, and prolonging the war by admitting the doctrine
that the Federal Government had a right to coerce the seceded
States. If these States were independent, the refusal to entertain the
same international intercourse with them as with the North was unjust,
no matter what may have been the motive prompting it. He does not
complain of any treaty being concluded between the United States and
Europe for the abolishment of privateering, although the prohibition
to either belligerent to dispose of its prizes in European ports
operated with intense severity against the South, by depriving her of
the only means of maintaining, with some approach to equality, a
struggle on the ocean.</p>

<p>He declares the anxiety of the South for peace, but says that its
determination against submission is unalterable. He denounces the
conduct of the Union armies as atrocious and cruel. Referring to
Mr. Lincoln's emancipation proclamation, he says he may well leave it
to the instincts of the common humanity of men of all countries to
pass judgment upon a measure by which millions of human beings of
inferior race, peaceful and contented labourers in their sphere, are
doomed to extermination, while they are encouraged to commit
assassination by an insidious recommendation to abstain from violence
unless in self-defence. Commissioned Federal officers attempting to
execute the proclamation will, if captured, be delivered to the State
authorities to be dealt with according to the State laws
for the punishment of criminals exciting insurrection.</p>

<p>General Butler has received a cordial reception in Boston, and
expounded his plan there for making France and England pay the
interest on the United States' national debt by means of an export
duty on cotton.</p>

<p>In several counties of Eastern Maryland the slaves, though not
affected by Mr. Lincoln's proclamation, refuse to work without
wages.</p>

<p>A Democratic United States' senator has been elected by the
Pennsylvanian Legislature by a majority of two votes over Mr. Cameron,
the ex-Secretary of War and Minister to Russia. In New Jersey the
Democratic Legislature have sent to the Federal Senate Colonel
J.W. Wall, who was sent to Fort Lafayette by Mr. Simon Cameron a few

<p>On the 10th inst. Dr. Lyman Beecher died in Brooklyn, at the
advanced age of eighty-seven years and three months. He left thirteen
children surviving him, of whom Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, the
Rev. Henry Ward Beecher, Dr. Edward Beecher, and Miss Catherine
Beecher are best known to fame. Forty years ago he took a prominent
part in combating the advance of Unitarianism in Massachusetts, and
was one of the ablest opponents of the late Dr. Channing.</p>

<p>Mr. George Francis Train has narrowly escaped being lynched at
Jonesville, Wisconsin. The telegram does not state the reason for this
manifestation of popular displeasure, but it probably arose from
Mr. Train's denunciation of the emancipation proclamation and the
negro race.</p>

from Liverpool for a supply of coals on the 23rd inst. The craft is a
tender to the well-known Alabama, and laden with arms and
ammunition. She has a crew of sixty persons, all picked men; they are
bearded, and most ferocious-looking sea-dogs. She also has a large
quantity of tea and other necessaries on board for the Alabama, and
carries twenty-eight guns. It is stated that she steams sixteen
miles an hour, and is bound for Nassau, her crew having signed
articles for that port, and will probably run the blockade to
Charleston. She left Holyhead on the 24th.--<hi rend="italic">Freeman's Journal.</hi></p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, JANUARY</hi> 31,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> have to record another diplomatic
incident in the history of the American War. The Emperor of the French
has caused a despatch of importance to be sent by his Foreign Minister
to M. Mercier, who represents France at Washington. It has been called
"officious" by the French journals, and it remains to be seen in which
of the two senses attaching to the word the Americans will interpret
the interference--"officious" implying, according to their own Noah
Webster, "kind and obliging," and also "intermeddling in affairs with
which one has no concern." Certainly, so far as externals go, there is
nothing in the despatch of M. Drouyn de Lhuys to offend the most
sensitive nation in the world. The Emperor does not offer mediation,
he does not even offer to interfere; but he dwells upon his friendship
for the United States--upon the pain he feels in witnessing the raging
war; declares that he takes all susceptibilities into account, and
merely makes suggestions for a negotiation. He does not ask that the
war may be discontinued while such negotiation is <sic corr="in">in</sic> progress. On the
contrary, he reminds the North that <sic corr="soldiers">soldiern</sic> may go on fighting while
civilians are debating, and that the cessation of strife may be
contemporaneous with the adjustment of terms. But he urges that
conferences might be advantageously held between the belligerents,
who, instead of mutually accusing one another, might discuss the
questions which separate them. This, he represents, would involve no
humiliation, would exclude the idea of alien pressure of any kind, and
would simply be a practical investigation into reciprocal
grievances.</p>

<p>If the Emperor had to do anything, it is difficult to say that he
could have done less or put his points more graciously. There has not
been time to hear how the despatch (a copy of which was to be left
with Mr. Seward, if desired, according to usage) has been received in
America, and it is very hard to speculate upon the course which the
strangely-constituted mass called the American people will take upon
any given subject. The American organs here are uninstructed, and are
of course fumbling in the dark while compelled to say something; but,
not knowing what to say that may not be repudiated by the next mail,
their trumpets give a very uncertain sound, for they themselves know
not whether to blow the signal for battle. But, on the whole, it
appears to be thought that the proposal of the Emperor will be
declined, partly on a ground to which his Majesty himself adverts, and
partly on a plea which, obstinate and pedantic as it is, represents an
idea that is not altogether to be treated with disrespect. The ground
alluded to by the Emperor is the hope and belief of the North that it
is conquering the South, or will be able to do so. His Majesty is too
courteous to point out the futility of this notion, or to represent
that the North, having been beaten in nearly every important
engagement, and its armies at this moment recoiling from two
disastrous attempts upon the principal strongholds of the South, the
signs of the war cannot be read favourably for the Federals, even by
the most resolute of their prophets. He passes this by, and he also
abstains from dwelling upon the second difficulty. The North declares
the Confederates to be "rebels," and is enraged at Europe's
recognising them as belligerents; and as the doing this must be the
first step towards a pacific conference it does not seem very probable
that Mr. Lincoln or his Cabinet (two distinct agencies, as the
President is unceremoniously told by some of his subjects) will
venture upon a measure much more rational than popular. So that
although, as we have said, anything like prediction as to the course
of the American people would be very hazardous, there does not seem to
be any great likelihood of the olive-branch appearing in a French
hand.</p>

<p>We have also to hear what the South has to say. President Davis has
been again addressing his people, and his tone is, as usual, temperate
but resolute. He complains that the European Powers have refused to
recognise privateering, and thereby have prevented the Confederates
from availing themselves of the results of their naval prowess, and he
affects to regard this step as a sort of declaration against the
South. But he points with justifiable exultation to the successes of
the Confederates, and adds that their enemies are now feeling the
pressure and hardship which the Slave States have borne so
bravely. His note is naturally one of continued defiance. Supposing
that Washington should be moved by the representations of the
Emperor--and we may here observe that some of the Northern journals
think that it would not disgrace the Federals to be the first to
suggest proposals--it is perfectly certain that in the present temper
of the South the very first demand upon the subject of slavery would
be one that would set the still powerful Abolitionist party in a red
flame. The slaves of the States in revolt are as free as a piece of
paper can make them, and it is said that a great number of Virginian
slaves have actually availed themselves of the notification of
New-Year's Day. At all events, some three millions and a half of
slaves have been proclaimed free men. The very first article to be
submitted to Conference by the South must run in this way:--"The
proclamation to be rescinded, the negroes to be formally restored to
slavery, and all blacks who may have availed themselves of the decree
to be given up to the authorities of their respective States." Will
the Abolitionists bear that? For assuredly nothing less will satisfy
the victorious Confederates; and, unless the Washington
plenipotentiaries--if such persons can exist--enter the
Conference-room unprepared to assent to this article they had better
stay at home. It may be that the South would concede a good deal in
return for this article, and for a second which should reaffirm the
desirability of slavery and re-enact it for the Confederate States;
for it would be absurd to suppose that the "Chivalry" are not as tired
of the fratricidal war as the "Yankees;" but is it possible for the
Abolition party to concede this stultification of themselves, this
retractation of all that they have been so clamorously saying for the
last eleven months?</p>

<p>Finally, we may observe that, with recent successes and even in the
face of the disaster at Murfreesboro', the tone of the South has
become firmer and firmer, and it is even more emphatic than ever in
its exultation at the prospect of being freed from the yoke of what it
calls the greedy, hard, usurious Yankee. In a word, the South is bent
upon the experiment of standing alone, and it is impossible to refuse
to it the right of trying that experiment. If the Conference can act
upon the principle of separation, it is, of course, the natural method
of terminating a hideous strife; but, if not, we fear that the
Imperial suggestions are not worth the paper on which they are
written; unless, as is not impossible, they may be intended for
rejection, and this rejection may be intended to be regarded as a
vindication of another step of a different nature.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Bombardment of
Fredericksburg.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> act of the Federals, which took place on the 11th of December
last, began the late hostilities on the Rappahannock which continued
for five days and ended, as our readers are aware, in a decisive
victory for the Confederates. At the time chosen by our Special Artist
for making the accompanying Illustration (on page 116) the Federals
had over 150 guns directed on the town from the heights on the
opposite side of the river; and it was under cover of this tremendous
cannonade that their troops commenced crossing by three
pontoons. Their dense masses can be seen in the distance winding down
to the river. The town is on fire in various places from the shelling,
but 300 Mississippians still hold their ground as sharpshooters on the
Confederate bank, annoying the heads of the columns as they appear on
the bridges. General Lee's plan, however, as is now well known, was to
let the enemy cross and attack him in the strong position in which he
had ensconced his forces. The infantry moving along the road in the
foreground are proceeding to rifle-pits in front of the battery seen
on the hill on the left, which was the first of the Confederate
defences, and held by Colonel Walter's Washington artillery--of which
position more anon.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Incident in the Battle of
Fredericksburg.--The Attack on</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Marye's Hill.</hi></p>

<p>The attempt of the Federals to carry the first of the Confederate
positions on their right--the battery of the Washington Battery, on
Marye's Hill, commanded by Colonel Walton--was, as our readers are
aware, totally unsuccessful, and most disastrous to them. Immense
masses were hurled at intervals on the hill and works, shown in our
Illustration; but at each attack they were driven back with immense
loss. "From the point where I stood, with Generals Lee and Longstreet,"
says our Special Artist, writing from the Confederate camp, "I could
see the grape, shell, and canister from the guns of the Washington
artillery mow great avenues in the masses of Federal troops rushing to
the assault, while the infantry, posted behind a breastwork just under
the battery, decimated the nearest columns of the enemy. In the
distance, Franklin's corps is seen deploying into line of battle on
the Federal left. They have some field-batteries thrown forwards
shelling the Confederate positions on the wooded range of hills. A
portion of Fredericksburg is seen in the rear of the attacking forces,
and beyond is the range of heights on the opposite side of the river
from which the Northerners have heavy guns playing on Marye's Hill to
cover the advance of their men. Numbers of their shell are bursting
over the Confederate soldiers in the breastwork. It was here General
Cobb was killed, and it is his brigade acting as sharpshooters. At the
back of this hill a South Carolinian had a portion of his head carried
away within four yards of myself by a shell from the heights alluded
to above. After the battle, I counted 660 dead lying on a small plot
of ground, scarcely four acres in extent, at the foot of the hill
shown in the Illustration; and, altogether 1493 were buried between
the hill and the town. Eight hundred were buried on that part of the
field occupied by Franklin. These were all Federals. This makes the
Northern dead on the right and left amount to 2293. The Federals,
besides this, buried many within their own lines on the night of the
battle."</p>

<p>The Southern correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, in
his letter from Richmond, written shortly after the battle of
Fredericksburg, has some remarks on the important post at Marye's
Hill, and of the dreadful slaughter of the assaulting troops, to whose
bravery he bears no niggard testimony. He says:--"By far the most
important position was occupied by the Washington artillery, commanded
by Colonel Walton, of New Orleans, and posted on the heights in the
immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg, not more than 400 yards
from the town. These heights, which are precisely of that altitude
which is most favourable for the play of artillery, are surmounted by
a brick house, now riddled by round shot, belonging to Mr. Marye, and
are commonly called Marye's Heights. At their base a road winds,
protected on one side by the hills and on the other by a solid stone
wall, about four feet in height, over which a brigade of Confederates,
themselves perfectly sheltered, poured the deadliest and most
effective of fires. . . . The battle which had dashed furiously
against the lines of Generals Hood, A. P. Hill, and Early, was little
more than child's play as compared with the onslaught directed by the
Federals in the immediate neighbourhood of Fredericksburg. The
impression that the Confederate batteries would not fire heavily upon
the Federals advancing in this quarter, for fear of injuring the town
of Fredericksburg, is believed to have prevailed among the Northern
Generals. How bitterly they deceived themselves subsequent events
served to show. To the Irish division, commanded by General Meagher,
was principally committed the desperate task of bursting out of the
town of Fredericksburg and forming, under the withering fire of the
Confederate batteries, to attack Marye's Heights, lowering immediately
in their front. Never at Fontenoy, at Albuera, or at Waterloo was more
undoubted courage displayed by the sons of Erin than during those six
frantic dashes which they directed against the almost impregnable
position of their foe. That any mortal men could have carried the
position before which they were wantonly sacrificed, defended as it
was, it seems to me idle for a moment to believe; but the bodies which
lie in dense masses within forty yards of the muzzles of Colonel
Walton's guns are the best evidence what manner of men they were who
pressed on to death with the dauntlessness of a race which lies gamed
glory on a thousand battle-fields, and never more richly deserved it
than at the foot of Marye's Heights on the 13th day of December,
1862."</p>

<p>The same correspondent, in a subsequent letter written on Dec. 20,
thus returns to the subject of the loss of life resulting from the
attack on Marye's Hill:--"A glance at the long slope between the town
of Fredericksburg and the foot of Marye's Heights gave the best idea
of the magnitude of the toll which had been exacted for the Federals'
passage of the Rappahannock. A ride along the whole length of the
lines told also a sad tale of slaughter; but when the eye had once
rested upon the fatal slope above mentioned the memory became fixed
upon the spot, nor for fifty years to come will that scene ever fade
from the memory of those who saw it. There, in every attitude of
death, lying so close to each other that you might step from body to
body, lay acres of the Federal dead. It seemed that most of the faces
which lay nearest to Colonel Walton's artillery were of the well-known
Milesian type. In one small garden, not more than half an acre in
size, there were 151 corpses. I doubt whether in any battle-field of
modern times the dead have ever lain so thick and close. By universal
consent of those who have seen all the great battles of this war
nothing like it has ever been seen before."</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer City of Baltimore we have New York
journals to the 24th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Burnside, on the 20th ult., issued the following address to
his army, preparatory to another assault on the heights beyond
Fredericksburg:--</p>
<q><p>The commanding General announces to the Army of the Potomac that
they are about to meet the enemy once more.</p>
<p>The late brilliant actions in North Carolina, Tennessee, and
Arkansas divided and weakened the enemy on the Rappahannock; and the
auspicious moment seems to have arrived to strike a great and mortal
blow at the rebellion, and to gain that decisive victory which is due
to the country.</p>
<p>Let the gallant officers of so many brilliant battle-fields
accomplish this achievement, and a fame the most glorious awaits
them. The commanding General calls for a firm and united action of
officers and men; and, under the providence of God, the army of the
Potomac will have taken the great step towards restoring peace to the
country and the Government to its rightful authority.</p></q>

<p>A furious storm of rain impeded the promised advance of the army,
but a statement received from the South announces that General Hooker
had crossed the Rappahannock. The state of the Federal army, which is
reported to amount to 135,000 men, inclusive of the reserves under
General Siegel, is unsatisfactory. The men lack their old enthusiasm
and self-confidence, are dissatisfied at not receiving their pay, and
openly express their want of confidence in General Burnside.</p>

<p>On the 18th a small fleet left New York for some point South. It
contained two new ironclads, built by Mr. Ericsson. These vessels, the
Nahant and Weehawken, arrived safely in the Chesapeake after a
boisterous sea passage.</p>

<p>The Confederate authorities have ordered that Federal officers
captured after Jan. 12 shall be delivered up to the Governors of the
States where captured. General Halleck has ordered that no more
Confederate officers shall be released on parole.</p>

<p>The Federal steamer Columbia ran ashore at Masonborough Inlet,
North Carolina, and her commander and crew surrendered to the
Confederates.</p>

<p>In the West the Federal hospital authorities report that their
total loss at Murfreesboro' was 10,287 in killed, wounded, and
missing.</p>

<p>The Federal gun-boats continue their career of success in
Arkansas. They have penetrated 300 miles up the White River, and have
captured four more posts thereon.</p>

<p>On the 16th ult. a body of Confederates attacked the Federal relief
and store ships proceeding up the Cumberland River in Tennessee, and
succeeded in capturing five steam-boats laden with valuable commissary
stores and the gun-boat Slidell. The negro crews were stripped of
their clothing, tied to trees, cowhided, and left to starve on
shore.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington. </hi></p>

<p>The House of Representatives has rejected all that portion of
Mr. Chase's financial project which relates to the substitution of a
uniform Federal currency for the present local bank circulation.</p>

<p>The President, after signing the bill for the emission of
100,000,000 dols. in Treasury notes for the payment of the army and
navy, sent a message to Congress begging it to pass Mr. Chase's
financial schemes into law. The message was resented by the Senate as
an attempt at dictation.</p>

<p>A series of resolutions have been introduced in the Senate by a
California senator denouncing the French occupation of Mexico as a
violation of international law and of the London Treaty of October
1861, and requesting President Lincoln to negotiate a treaty with
Mexico, in order to give more effect to the views expressed in these
resolutions. The New York papers, while approving of the spirit of
these resolutions, concur in considering them ill-timed and
impracticable.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the Mexican Minister at Washington and
Mr. Seward has been published. The former complains of the unchecked
shipment of waggons and mules from New York on French
account. Mr. Seward's defence is that, as there has been no
declaration of war between France and Mexico, the duties of neutrals
do not attach to such a state of things. The Mexican Minister next
complains that his side is not allowed to export arms from New
York. Mr. Seward explains that this embargo results from a municipal
law which forbids the export of arms from the United States at this
crisis. The Mexican Minister charges the American Government with
cringing to France.</p>

<p>The Washington <hi rend="italic">National Intelligencer</hi>
publishes eight columns of intercepted Confederate despatches, being
letters of instruction to Messrs. Mason and Slidell, and other
Confederate agents in Europe. The most important part of the
correspondence relates to a movement on the part of the French Consuls
at Galveston and Richmond to induce Texas to secede from the Southern
Confederacy and establish an independent Government. The result of
this discovery was an  order to General Magruder to send the Consul at
Galveston to Mexico as soon as possible, and the Richmond Consul to
leave forthwith. The order, however, with regard to the latter was
rescinded. It further appears that Mr. Mason was offended by the
uncivil deportment of Earl Russell. The Confederate Secretary of State
complains of the arrogance of many British statesmen as one cause why
England is so little loved, and contrasts the unpoliteness of Earl
Russell with the courtesy of M. Thouvenel.</p>

<p>The inaugural address of the Governor of Delaware expresses strong
Union and Emancipation sentiments, and favours a vigorous prosecution
of the war. The message of the Governor of New Jersey is still more
hostile to the Administration and Emancipation than was the message of
Governor Seymour, of New York.</p>

<p>The tone of the Northern mind is more nervous and desponding than
at any time since the commencement of the war. The Democratic
hostility to the emancipation policy is daily making itself more
troublesome. The tendency to mob violence is increasing. The New York
Legislature has been unable to organise. The candidate of the
Republican party for the office of Speaker has been threatened with
assassination on the floor of the House by members of the Democratic
party. A mob of "rowdies" from New York city have been present in the
galleries and on the floor of the House. The Senate has requested
Governor Seymour to call out the militia to protect the Assembly from
the terrorism of the mob; but the Governor refuses to act against the
most active spirits of his party. Similar scenes have taken place at
Trenton and Harrisburg, the capitals of New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.</p>

of voting the thanks of the inhabitants of that borough to the
American merchants and people for the provisions they have sent for
the unemployed Lancashire operatives. Mr. Bright addressed the meeting
in a speech which was devoted to the subject of the war in America,
and to the duty of Britain with regard to that struggle. The

<p>The message of the President of the Republic of Liberia
(Mr. S. A. Benson), received by the last African mail, gives a
satisfactory account of the progress and prospects of that
country. The President details the circumstances of his recent visit
to England, and speaks in grateful terms of the reception accorded to
him, and of the disposition officially manifested to promote a
satisfactory adjustment of boundary and all other questions in which
England, from her position on the African coast, is relatively
interested with Liberia. Great vigilance continues to be exercised by
the Liberian Government to frustrate the slave trade in the
neighbouring territories, and often with considerable success. The
people are paying increased attention to the profitable cultivation of
the soil, and the production of cotton, sugar, and other articles is
likely to increase. Within the last twelve months six sugar-mills have
been imported.  Iron and coal deposits exist, which it is hoped may
soon be turned to account. A conviction is expressed that the war in
the United States will cause an immense voluntary efflux of the
coloured population of that country to Liberia, and this view is
urged as a stimulus to all Liberians; to set such an example of
industry as shall render the Republic increasingly beneficial as a
place of refuge. The notice obtained by the contribution of Liberia to
the International Exhibition is likewise alluded to with
gratification.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 7,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Whatever</hi> light may be thrown upon the foreign relations of America
by the debates which have recommenced at Westminster, it is certain
that the state of the war and the domestic politics of the so-called
Union are involved in a haze which at once obscures and distorts the
objects it envelops. At this moment the American journals which are
supposed to have the best means of procuring information can tell us
neither what is being done nor what is wished. It is true that each of
the leading papers--<hi rend="italic">c&#xE6;ci
c&#xE6;cos</hi>--is in a manner wedded to a party. When such is the
case in England, and when such used to be the case in France, the
utterances of party organs were at least frank and intelligible, let
them be worth what they might as exponents of truth. But even the
party organs in Federalia seem afraid of the crisis, of one another,
and of themselves, and anything more helplessly self-contradictory
than the united evidence of the American press upon the present
condition of affairs can hardly be conceived. There seems only one
point upon which they are agreed, although they express their
conviction, of course, with more or less reticence, and that is, that
the President of the North is a mistake. A certain amount of credit is
given to him for being a well-meaning man, but such saving clauses are
always followed by an array of proof that all his well-meanings lead
to bad ends. The Democrats are naturally the most unsparing in their
strictures on Mr. Lincoln. They do not actually invite him to lay down
his authority and subside into the country attorney, but they
endeavour to impress upon the public that, unless he does pretty much
the same thing--namely, abandons all his plans and all his
Cabinet--the nation will be ruined. The Abolitionists are bound to
praise his proclamation; but they regard it as a <hi rend="italic">brutum fulmen</hi> until the war shall be carried on in
a way which they evidently consider him unable to point out, or even
superintend; and, indeed, the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> seems
inclined to give up the game, and proposes that the North shall "bow
to malignant fate" if another three months' sharp fighting (again
ninety days) shall not have suppressed the Confederates.</p>

<p>We do not yet hear how the Imperial Message recommending a
conference has been received. But his Majesty's declaration that he
proposes to stop the undue extension of Anglo-Saxon dominion in
America has given great offence, although circumstances will scarcely
permit the Federals to display the anger they feel. We do not attach
much weight to a demonstration which has been made on the subject in
Congress. It is not to be expected that the North will fly in the face
of their former idol and compel him to a recognition for which they
believe him to be only too ready. The celebrated Mexican despatch does
not come formally under the notice of Mr. Seward, and he will hardly
volunteer to take it up; and he may urge that it concerns the South
even more than the North. We shall be surprised if this despatch,
which in other days would have been answered by a riotous
demonstration of defiance, will prevent Mr. Seward from returning a
very polite answer to the conference proposal. We may also risk the
expression of our belief that unless that answer be a direct
acceptance of the scheme--an event hardly within probability--it will
not very much disturb the present plan of the Emperor of the
French.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the army of the Potomac, under
Burnside, is once more to be launched against the Confederates. We
have heard of marchings and counter-marchings, but we finally read an
almost piteous appeal from the Commander-in-Chief urging his soldiery
to do something for the honour of the Union. It is scarcely fair to
put the matter in this way, and, unless we are misinformed, the army
itself sees the unfairness, as well as something else, which it does
not hesitate to talk about. The Federals have gone to the slaughter
with a courage that makes it shocking to see how badly they are
handled by their leaders. Such men under a Wellington or a Clyde would
have had another story to tell than one of incessant disaster and
defeat. And the courage of the poor foolish hirelings, especially the
Irish, who dashed themselves almost upon the guns that blew them away,
is undeniable. But the army can have no confidence in such leadership
as it has hitherto had, and without confidence in its chiefs an army
is a mob. If it be true that the soldiers of the Potomac are once more
to be brought up to the defences of the Confederates, instead of being
led in a way that offers reasonable hope of success, we see not how
such wanton waste of life is to be justified in the face of
civilisation.</p>

<p>Meantime we are told that the North is really advancing to victory,
for, though defeated in every pitched battle save one, the result of
which was only less disastrous than defeat, it is forcing its way in
upon the Confederate territory at various points other than in
Virginia, and that its attacks are telling upon the resources of the
enemy. It is easy to say this, and it may be consolatory to those who
are prompt to accept such assurances. But where is the proof?
Doubtless New Orleans is in the hands of the Federals (who have done
some good there, by-the-way, in compensation for much evil); but the
possession of the Crescent City has rather relieved the South of a
troublesome and dangerous post than injured the cause of the
Confederates. And we know not what else there is to point at as a
triumph. On the river the Federals have notoriously failed, and it is
thought that the latest failure is still being kept back from the
knowledge of the public. But were twenty "points" made, the sole use
of such occupation is to serve as a basis for operations, and it is
mere child's play to talk of gain when such gain amounts to nothing
but the holding an isolated spot, whence no practical movement can he
made. We in England have had, unhappily, too much acquaintance with
the real meaning of war to be deceived by the nonsense which passes
muster among those who are profoundly ignorant of the true objects and
nature of warfare, though they are singularly prompt at picking up its
technicalities. We judge dispassionately, and we are unable to
perceive that the war is really making any progress at all, or that
the vaunted successes are more than a series of tentatives, more
resembling exploration than military achievement. Furthermore, at the
risk of offence, we must say that we believe the American public to be
hopelessly in the dark as to the campaign; and that, if it were
possible for their vanity to study the strife through the English
newspapers, there would soon be a demonstration of a very different
kind from that of any which has yet been reported. Yes, we say it
frankly--but without the least intention of wounding sensitive
Americans--the fact is, that the boasted press of the North has proved
hollow and rotten in the hour of trial, and when the English press
best vindicates its claims to the respect and confidence of the
people. The Americans have been content with "smart" journals, and the
end of all is that the Union is left at the mercy of ignorance and of
dishonesty. May a better state of things arise out of the present
dismal chaos!</p></div2>

<p rend="center">OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p rend="center">...THE QUEEN'S SPEECH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi></p>
<p>...Her majesty has abstained from taking any step with a view to
induce a cessation of the conflict between the contending parties in
the North American States; because it has not yet seemed to her
Majesty that any such overtures could be attended with any probability of
success.</p>

<p>Her Majesty has viewed with the deepest concern the desolating
warfare which still rages in these regions; and she has witnessed with
heartfelt grief the severe distress and suffering which that war has
inflicted upon a large class of her Majesty's subjects, but which have
been borne by them with noble fortitude and with exemplary
resignation. It is some consolation to her Majesty to be led to hope
that this suffering and this distress are rather diminishing than
increasing, and that some revival of employment is beginning to take
place in the manufacturing districts...</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Address.</hi></p>
<p>The Royal Speech having been read by the Lord Chancellor, and
again by the clerk at the table,</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Dudley</hi> rose to move an address in
reply, which as usual was a mere echo of the speech itself...</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Granard</hi>,in a brief speech,
seconded the address.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> contrasted the
circumstances under which the House now assembled with those which
marked the opening of Parliament last year....He was anxious to say
that he had no objection to raise the course which her Majesty's
Government had taken with regard to the desolating war now raging in
the United States. He regretted that the Government had not felt
themselves justified in joining in the attempt, however hopeless, in
which they were invited by the Sovereign of France, not to intervene
for the purpose of putting an end to the war, but to obtain by their
good offices, if possible, such an armistice and cessation of
hostilities as would lead the two parties themselves to reflect on the
miseries and hopelessness of the war in which they were engaged. But,
before he censured the course taken by the Government, it was but fair
that he should say that they were in possession of much better
information than he was as to whether any interference on their part
would have been a judicious step. He differed from the opinion which
had been expressed by many of his political friends that the time had
arrived for recognising the Southern States. There were only two cases
in which a recognition on the part of a neutral Power could be
justified--namely, where there was no further struggle going on, as
was the case when the South American States which had revolted from
Spain were recognised, or when it was desirable in the interest of
humanity that the great Powers should interfere in order to prevent
the longer continuance of a desolating warfare. But in that case
recognition was always followed by something further. It meant the
support by force of arms of the claims of the country whose rights
were recognised, such as was the case in the separation of Belgium from
Holland and of Greece from Turkey. His conviction was that, come what
may, the reconstruction of the United States as they formerly stood
was absolutely impossible; and, on the whole, he approved of the course
which her Majesty's Government had taken. There was another aspect in
which the war in America had a serious bearing upon industry,
happiness, and prosperity of this country--namely, in the cotton
famine which had been produced...</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi>, in reply to the remarks of
the noble Earl, justified the policy of non-intervention which the
Government had pursued in reference to the American War. The
circumstances were very different from those which existed when
Belgium was separated from Holland and Greece from Turkey; and,
taking all matters into consideration, he thought her Majesty's
Government had taken the wisest course in their power to pursue. At
the same time he expressed a strong opinion that it would be
impossible for the union of the Northern and Southern States to be again
established...</p>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Malmesbury</hi> expressed great
regret that her Majesty's Government had not joined with France in an
attempt to mediate between the two contending parties in America, so
that that deplorable struggle might be brought to a satisfactory
termination.</p>

<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Grey</hi> differed from Lord Malmesbury in
believing that the Government had neglected their duty in declining to
join with France in the offer of their good offices in the dispute
between the Northern and Southern States of America.  If the good
offices of her Majesty's Government in conjunction with France would
have contributed to produce the termination of the war it would have
been unpardonable if they had refused to exercise them; but, looking at the state
of feeling in America with regard to this country at that time, he
thought the interference of the Government would have produced more
harm than good...</p>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">...The Address In Answer To The Queen's
Speech.</hi></p>
<p>The Speaker having read from the chair her Majesty's gracious
Speech,</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Calthorpe</hi> rose to move the address in
reply, and, reviewing the principal topics of the Queen's Speech,
briefly but warmly eulogised the proceedings and policy of the
Government. He warmly acknowledged the subscriptions from America
for the distress in Lancashire; which, sent in the midst of the
pettish and hostile attacks of the press, showed that the respectable
classes were well disposed towards England. He deeply deplored the
course of the war, and the extremes to which the more violent parties
were ready to go in the Northern States, at the same time expressing a
hearty admiration of the gallantry and fortitude of the
Confederates...</p>
<p>The address having been read from the chair,</p>
<p>Mr.<hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> said the House would deeply
sympathise with the feelings of her Majesty on so interesting an event
as the marriage of the heir apparent....</p>
<p>The House would also deeply sympathise with the Sovereign in
deploring the vicissitudes to which a large and important portion of
her subjects had been subjected, and in her admiration of the
fortitude with which they had been sustained. He trusted that these
vicissitudes would, however, have a tendency towards promoting a
sounder and more permanent prosperity; and, whilst, they might rather
be regarded as a misfortune than a calamity, they would teach all
classes that they had an interest in one great commmonwealth. They
might on such occasions expect to learn how long this state of things
was likely to last; but, for his own part, he could not but regard
what was passing in America as a revolution. He briefly sketched the
rise of the Union, and expressed an opinion that the ultimate results
of the war would be an America very different to that known to our
fathers and even to this generation. There would be an America of
farmers, an America of diplomacy, and an America of turbulence and
wars. He believed that the course originally marked out by the
Government was one honorable to the country and beneficial to all its
interests. He was, therefore, greatly mortified in the autumn when an
important member of the Government, apparently with the sanction of
his colleagues, made a declaration which could only be regarded as an
intention to recognise the Confederate Republic. He felt that this was
a great vacillation and inconsistency. The Foreign Secretary said that
the North was fighting for empire and the South for independence; but
the President of the Board of Trade the other day alleged that the
cause of the war was slavery. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was
warmly in favour of the South; but he was followed by the Secretary at
War, who avowed opinions diametrically opposite; and, lastly, the
Chief Secretary of Ireland declared that it was his conviction that
the Lord of Hosts was fighting for the Confederates.</p></div2>

that of the abolition of slavery--for which <hi rend="italic">last</hi> consummation all good

<p rend="center">NEGRO EMANCIPATION: THE MEETING IN</p>
<p rend="center">EXETER HALL.</p>

<p>As there are currents in the deep sea (well known to the careful
mariner) which have no necessary connection with the course of the
waves on the surface, and are often diametrically opposed to them,
even when these latter appear to be triumphantly sweeping along
towards a given destination, so it seems public opinion may at the
most critical moments display similar phenomena; and startle the
political mariner by the discovery that all his art in trimming his
sails to the wind, all his steadiness in directing the helm, do not
enable him to baffle or escape from the unseen "ground-swell" below,
which is carrying him he hardly knows whither, but certainly not in
the way that he wanted to go.</p>

<p>No event in recent times has so strongly helped to remind us of
this well-known, but half-forgotten, truth as the meeting of Thursday
week in Exeter Hall. Here have we been for many months past pretty
well all of one mind as to the American question, that is to say,
convinced the North is fighting for "empires" and the South for
"independence;" convinced that if the latter did not exactly behave
well in the outbreak of the war, it has fought so splendidly since
that it cannot be subjugated, and must, therefore, in the end succeed ;
convinced, finally, that it would be best on the whole to leave slavery
at present where it is, in the hands of the masters, and trust to the
progress of humanity, of knowledge of economical laws, and of the
absence of irritation through abolition attacks, to do away
ultimately with so great an evil. That, we believe, is a fair
statement of the opinions predominant generally through society, in
accordance with the ceaseless teaching of nine-tenths of the whole
English press.</p>

<p>But of late a new element has begun to be dimly visible. As the
Northern Legislation and Administration have become of a more
decidedly anti-slavery cast we have heard of small local meetings
rising like bubbles to the surface of public opinion, and evaporating
with a feeble breath in favour of the North. Then it undoubtedly
excited surprise that the Lancashire operatives were so quiet under
all their sufferings as to render it impossible to rouse them into an
active agitation for blockade-breaking; and somehow it began to be
whispered about that the explanation of their conduct was that they
didn't feel quite satisfied about slavery not being at the bottom of
the whole business of Southern revolt. But when Mr. Lincoln's
proclamation of September last, offering emancipation with
compensation up to Jan. 1, and threatening emancipation without
compensation on and after that day if his offer were not
accepted--when this broke like a thunder-clap upon the world we
entered upon a new and difficult, and anxious period. For, while on
the one hand there were but few persons who did not still loudly
denounce slavery, there were still fewer who did not see that
Mr. Lincoln's Government had taken that tremendous step not because it
was advisable or right in itself, but because he found the North
could not beat the South without doing so. Of course, in saying this
we do not say or suggest that Mr. Lincoln was a hypocrite, or that he
acted in opposition to his known character, antecedents, or wishes. We
only say, as a matter of fact which cannot be disputed, that while
the previous anti-slavery measures, such as (among others) the
abolition of slavery in Columbia, the anti-slave trade treaty with
England, the permanent exclusion of slavery from the territories, and
the offer of Congress to assist the work of abolition by compensation,
all obviously sprang from a genuine anti-slavery sentiment, this
particular proclamation, the last of the series, as obviously did not,
but from the military failures of the North. No wonder, then, that
the general current of opinion (having previously been such as we have
described it) still remained on the whole friendly to the South and
unfriendly to the North, or that it began to be generally believed
that Mr. Lincoln's "military measure" would prove in its working a
very inhuman measure, as leading to a servile war.</p>

<p>But now there also began to be heard rumours of the formation of
some new society--an Emancipation Society--originating, like the old
anti-slavery body, in the religious, and mainly in the dissenting,
world. Names of supporters began to be handed about, some of them
enjoying universal respect, some of them of world-wide
reputation. More local meetings were heard of--especially in the
metropolis. Then suddenly Manchester burst out with an assemblage
several thousand strong in the Free Trade Hall. Liverpool merchants
and others assembled to prepare for the renewal in their town of the
former anti-slavery agitation, and decided, by an "overwhelming
majority," to do so, in spite of Mr. Spence, who was present, and made
an eloquent, gallant, but unavailing effort to keep out of the
resolutions an expression of sympathy with the North. Then, too, the
journals condescended to notice the society in leaders, though the
notices were not more complimentary than the conversation between the
Prince and the beggar-boy, of which the boy was so proud, and which
consisted simply in the Prince's telling him to get out of the
way.</p>

<p>But whether the Emancipation Society esteemed the honour of being
thus noticed more than it felt the sting of the contemptuous words in
which the notices were couched, or whether it grew bolder through
these preliminary meetings, it certainly ventured at last to issue its
challenge to universal London, and "respectfully" to invite "all
parties" to the great room of Exeter Hall on the night of Thursday,
the 29th of January, 1863. We are careful to record the date; for, if
we do not misread the signs then and there presented, this meeting will
prove the turning-point of new and serious political issues. Thither
we ask the reader mentally to accompany us, promising him he need be
under no apprehension that we are about to try to influence his
sympathies or guide his judgment; we assume only the humbler task of
recording honestly that which we have heard and seen; and which he,
as an Englishman, knowing how the greatness of our country is
nurtured by the free expression of all honest opinion, and how
dependent the true statesman must be upon the accurate knowledge of
all such opinion, will, we are sure, be glad to have faithfully
related.</p>

<p>Having tickets for reserved seats we do not present ourselves till
about ten minutes before the time specified on them--seven o'clock;
but as we ascend the steps of the portico, we are warned by the
streams of people that we are, perhaps, taking the matter too
leisurely. And so we find it when we get our first glimpse of the
hall, and hurriedly ask for the seats that were to have been
reserved. "Where can we go?"  we ask despairingly, moved out of our
previous equanimity. The doorkeeper points to the far-distant gallery,
high up, and says he thinks there may yet be a chance there. But even
if he be right, which looks doubtful, it is certain that scores--nay,
hundreds--of other persons will be discovering the vacancies long
before we can possibly get there. We rush down stairs, speak to an
official, use the open sesame of "the press," and are hopefully
dismissed in quite another direction. But now, progress of any kind,
even through the corridors and passages, becomes difficult, at times
impossible, through the surging crowds who toss helplessly about,
seeking rest for the soles of their feet and finding none. There are
backward eddies to break through, as well as forward ones to force a
place among. Presently we are stopped by a barrier across a flight of
stairs descending into a lobby, where we pant and strive. "No one can
pass; the place is more than full." We glide round the side of the
stairs, climb up and up, get over the banister, and find we have,
unnoticed, turned the enemy's stronghold. Still in vain,
however. Everywhere we find dense masses of people; and we are about
to make the Englishman's last confession and acknowledge ourselves
beaten, when, happily, we come across one of the speakers of the night
floundering in the same difficult strait, but who obviously <hi rend="italic">must</hi> get
in. That fact gives us new hope. We appeal to him. He gallantly
takes us in tow, shouts "Reporter!" when advance is otherwise
impossible, and so we get at last into a sort of little black hole of
Calcutta, where we grow at once hopeless of further progress and
certain of being stifled if we stay where we are. Here, however, to
our immense relief, a door opens; some half dozen of us are shot
suddenly forwards and luckily do not fall; another instant, and we are
running up the stairs of the little box or covered way that admits
us to the platform, and there find breathing space and full
opportunity to drink in, in one wondering, awe-stricken glance, the
sublime spectacle of a vast sea of upturned faces, looking up towards
another sea scarcely less large that, in defiance of all the laws of
gravity, has ascended and overflowed every nook and corner of the
upraised expanse of the orchestra, leaving only the organ in the
centre towering calmly above the excited and sloping tide of life.</p>

<p>But scarcely has this seething mass of humanity begun to grow quiet
and satisfied in the pleasant and soothing sense of successful
conquest and possession, and to address itself to the business of the
night, before we hear distant but mighty shouts below, rumbling like
thunder among the valleys to an observer seated high on the hills; and
presently it is whispered about that the mere overflow of this hall
has filled another hall below, and that these shouts are from that
second exulting army on taking possession. But even that hall, we
soon hear, is equally incapable of dealing with the inflowing streams
of people; so, presently, the adjoining street (Exeter-street ) is
ringing with the tumultuous cheers of a third meeting, held in the
open air! Under these circumstances, and with the frequently-occurring incident that when we, who were above, were
trying to be quiet and listen, those distant reverberations would come
up to the ear with a most dramatic and exciting effect from below, it
is no wonder that the proper business of the evening went on under a
kind of high-pressure system, mentally and morally, and made it
difficult for the calmest heads to preserve their equilibrium.</p>

<p>Yet is it especially worthy of note (whatever the use made of the
fact) that none of the ordinary attractions helped to bring together
this wonderful gathering. It is quite true what has been said, that no
eminent statesmen or politicians were here; that few or none of the
old and famous anti-slavery families were represented; that none of
the speakers were men of genius; that commerce sent none of its
merchant princes; the aristocracy and gentry none of their
conspicuous members. But for that very reason we are driven to
confess how great must have been the "ground-swell" of public opinion
before it could thus burst upon our astonished eyes with all the
suddenness and fury of the maelstrom and the waterspout, unless,
indeed, we accept the solution since offered--that Federal money was
the mainspring!</p>

<p>The speakers of the evening were the Hon. and Rev. Baptist Noel;
Mr. Hughes, the well-known author of "Tom Brown;" the Rev. Mr. Newman
Hall; Mr. Taylor, the member for Leicester; and Mr. Ludlow, a
well-known contributer to <hi rend="italic">Macmillan's
Magazine</hi>. Among the faces of supporters on the platform one could
also distinguish Mr. Beales, Mr. Lucas; Mr. Victor Sch&#x153;lcher, the
French exile; Mr. Morse, the American Consul-General, and himself
distinguished as a man of practical science; Mr. Chamerovzow, the
secretary of the old Anti-Slavery Society, whose presence served to
unite the parent body with this, its vigorous successor; many
clergymen, including Mr. Landells, Dawson Burns, T. C. Solly, and
Rylance; and a number of other gentlemen with whom the general public
is more or less familiarly acquainted.</p>

<p>We should observe that Mr. Baptist Noel modestly acknowledged the
force of the sarcasms that have been launched as to the
insignificance of the promoters, but added, "they were only the
pickets of the great army of emancipation in this country;" and the
felicity of the retort was enhanced by the fact that the first
business of the meeting was to read letters of sympathy which had
been received from such persons as James Stuart Mill, the first of
living political economists; from General Thompson, illustrious in
the old days of anti-slavery and free-trade agitation (and who
characteristically inclosed &#xA3;10 to the society as the best way of
helping the Lancashire operatives); from Mr. James Stansfeld, and
Mr. W. E. Forster, the two most promising of all the independent
Liberals recently elected to Parliament; from Professors Cairne,
Newman, and Goldwin Smith; from Mr. E. Miall, Mr. George Thompson,
and several gentlemen of local standing in our chief cities. The
emancipation army, therefore, will not apparently be without its
Parliamentary generals, or its scholarly guides, whenever it begins
to march.</p>

<p>If it had been possible, after watching the reception given to the
first sentences from the chairman, the Rev. Mr. Evans, to doubt the
tone and temper of the assembled multitude, it was clearly impossible
to do so when he referred in a perfectly dispassionate manner to those
who wished to see America divided into two confederacies. He was
interrupted by a single voice that cried out "Emancipation and union!"
and then, as if that phrase had been a kind of electric shock that
went to every heart, there broke forth the most tremendous outburst of
popular enthusiasm it has ever been our fortune to witness. It could
not stop, but went on and on, the whole audience having leaped to
their feet with hats and handkerchiefs waving, having apparently only
waited for some such signal to relieve themselves from the almost painful
because suspended enthusiasm with which they overflowed. This
incident told all that any one could have needed to know as to the
feelings and views of the meeting. But the facts were to receive a
still more remarkable illustration. When the chairman, a little later,
happened to use the words, "Mr. Lincoln's election," again the same
tremendous cheers arose, and if the President could only have heard
them he must have begun to doubt his own identity with the
"best-abused" man alive, as he is generally esteemed to be.</p>

<p>Another incident of the meeting was interesting. Mr. Noel, towards
the close of his impassioned speech (which, however, was not distinctly
heard), stopped to announce that the men of Bradford (4000 strong)
were at that moment holding a similar meeting; and he proposed, to the
great satisfaction of his auditory, to dispatch a telegram saying, "We
are for emancipation and the Union; what are you?" Exactly the same
kind of thing occurred at a later hour with regard to Stroud, where,
also, an emancipation meeting was being held. These interruptions,
with those arising from the constant re-echoing of the cheers from the
two other meetings below and outside, gave quite a tone to the
evening.</p>

<p>We shall not attempt to describe the speeches, We desire only to
note those passages in them which helped to bring out into strong
relief the state of opinion that prevailed in the meeting. Mr. Noel's
speech was studded with such points. His narrative of recent
proceedings in the South with regard to the cruel punishment of the
slaves; his assertion, founded on the testimony of Mr. Jay, that at
least one negro had been burned annually for twenty years for rising
against their masters; his characterisation of the Southern leaders as
men of powerful intellect and energy; his demand to know the meaning
of Mr. Davis's statement that the proclamation has doomed millions of
beings of an inferior race to extermination--all these were caught up
so rapturously as to convey the impression that the speaker must have
expressed the views of his auditory even more perfectly than his
own.</p>

<p>Still it must not be supposed that all the audience were of one
mind. From each side of the platform, from the back of the platform,
from the middle of the great gallery, from the middle and sides of the
vast hall, rose from time to time cries of dissent and sarcasm; but
when an amendment was moved, and the mover, after fruitless efforts
to be heard, aided by a chivalrous but useless appeal from Mr. Newman
Hall, had it read by the latter and put to the vote, the opposition
dwindled away into some say two, some a dozen pair of hands, and so
put the seal to his signal discomfiture. A similar but later attempt
was equally ludicrous in its failure.</p>

<p>Decidedly the crowning speech of the evening was Mr. Newman
Hall's. His voice alone of all the speakers' voices filled easily and
perfectly the enormous space. His slight physique, earnest face, and
self-possessed yet impressive manner, must have given to many, as it
did to us, an idea of the strength of the Puritan element yet existing
among us, but not allied, as so often it was of old, to fanaticism or
to spiritual blindness towards everything grand or beautiful that is
not directly and obviously religious. He it was who frankly said they
were not there to justify the Northern dealing with the negro; not
there as advocates of the Union (which be still does advocate), but
of emancipation. And as his was perhaps the most highly finished and
certainly the most successful oratorical display of the evening, we
quote the peroration of his speech, with its magnificent invective
against slavery, where he asserts:--</p>

<q><p>That "God has made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the
face of all the earth" (cheers); that there is no right so sacred as
that which a man has to himself, no wrong so flagrant as that of
robbing a man of himself (cheers); that it is an abomination to steal
a man and to sell him (loud cheers); that it is no less an abomination
to breed a man and to sell him (Hear, hear) than for a man to barter
away his own offspring for gold (loud cheers); that it is an
abomination to expose men and women on the auction-block and feel
their muscles and hand them over to the highest bidder as you would
cattle (Shame!); that it is an abomination to deny to a woman the
rights of chastity and maternity (Hear); that it is an abomination to
declare that a coloured man has no rights which a white man need
respect (Hear, hear); that it is an abomination to flog judicially a naked woman,
whether she be a Hungarian Countess or an African slave (Hear, hear);
that it is an abomination to fine, imprison, flog, and, on a
repetition of the act, hang a man far teaching another man to read the
Bible (Hear, hear); that it is hideous blasphemy to cite that Bible of
a God of love in defence of such abominations (Hear, hear); that a
confederacy of men fighting in order to commit these abominations
should be regarded as engaged in a portentous piracy rather than in
legitimate warfare (cheers); that the conscience and heart of free
England can never wish to recognise an empire avowing as its
corner-stone the right to maintain and extend these abominations
(cheers); and, lastly, as the recognition of an empire involves
reception of its Ambassador, that the loyalty of Great Britain
loathes the very idea of such an indignity being offered to the Royal
Lady we delight to venerate as that her pure, matronly, and widowed
hand, which wields only the sceptre of love over the free, should ever
be contaminated by the kiss of any representative of so foul a conspiracy against
civilisation, humanity, and God!</p></q>

<p>We should despair of any attempt to give our readers on adequate
notion of the feeling called forth towards our Queen or against
slavery by the last sentence.</p>

<p>Our narrowing space will not allow us to dwell on Mr. Taylor's
powerful speech, in which he called John Brown "the Garibaldi of
America," and so evoked a new manifestation in honour of the memory of
the man whose soul is said to be ever marching on to the conquest of
slavery; or to Mr. Ludlow's, which was too late in the evening to be
done justice to. There is an end to everything, even to the enthusiasm
of such a meeting as this; so, after he had again roused to something
like light and glow the temper of the meeting in relation to
Mr. Beresford Hope's attacks on Mr. Lincoln's infamy as exceeding
even the infamy of Belshazzar, the proceedings were rapidly brought
to a close.</p>

<p>And then, on once more reaching the open air, we heard that a
second meeting had been held in Exeter-street larger than the first one,
in order to draw off the crowds from some unhappy Southern
sympathisers who had been too freely expressing their sentiments. No
less, therefore, than four distinct meetings had been developed out of
the one intended meeting, each with its own chairman and speakers,
among whom were Mr. Noel, Mr. Shaen, and several gentlemen who had
been in America, including the chaplain of General Burnside.</p>

<p>We conclude, as we began, with no intention to express here our own
views. But this one remark may be permitted. Whatever the result as
regards North and South--the permanent rupture or the reunion of the
States--it is impossible to doubt that the Divine hand is so fashioning
things as to destroy slavery.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">FRANCE AND AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> gave last week a summary of the
despatch addressed by M. Drouyn de Lhuys, the French Minister of
Foreign Affairs, to M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington,
suggesting proposals of peace to the Federal Government. The following
is a full translation of the document:--</p>

<q><p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">To M. Mercier, Minister Of The
Emperor At Washington.</hi></p>
<p rend="right">Paris, Jan. 9, 1863.</p>
<p>Sir,--If in forming the project of endeavouring by the offer of our
good offices to shorten the duration of hostilities which are
desolating the American Continent we had not above all things been
guided by the friendship for the United States which animates the
Government of the Emperor, the small success of our overtures might
have diminished the interest we feel in the incidents of this
struggle. But the sentiment we have obeyed is too sincere to allow
indifference to obtain entrance into our minds, or to prevent us from
being painfully affected by the continuance of the conflict. We cannot
regard without profound regret this more than civil war, which may be
compared with the most terrible intestine commotions of the old
republics, and the disasters of which multiply in proportion to the
resources and the courage displayed by each of the belligerents.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Government have fully examined, therefore, the
objections made to us when we suggested the idea of a friendly
mediation, and we have asked ourselves if they are really of a kind to
exclude as premature all attempts at reconciliation.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the repugnance of the United States to admit the
intervention of foreign influence has been pointed out to us; and, on
the other, the hope which the Federal Government has not abandoned of
obtaining a solution by force of arms.</p>

<p>Assuredly, Sir, there is nothing in recurring to the good offices
of one or several neutral Powers incompatible with the legitimate
pride of a great nation; and purely international wars do not alone
furnish us with examples of the useful part played by mediators. We
conceive, moreover, that in offering to place ourselves at the
disposition of the belligerents for the purpose of facilitating
between them negotiations, the basis of which we abstained from
prejudicing, we rendered to the patriotism of the United States the
regard more than ever due to it now, after so many fresh proofs of
moral force and energy. We are not less prepared, in the desires we 
entertain in favour of peace, to make allowance for the
susceptibilities of national sentiment, and we in nowise dispute the
right of the Federal Government to decline the co-operation of the
great maritime Powers of Europe. But is this co-operation the only
means of shortening the war which offers itself to the Washington
Cabinet? And if the latter thinks it ought to reject all foreign
intervention, might it not honourably accept the idea of direct
negotiations with the authority which represents the South?</p>

<p>The Federal Government, we know, does not despair of giving a more
active impulse to hostilities: sacrifices have not exhausted its
resources, still less its perseverance or its firmness. The duration
of the struggle, in fact, has not shaken its confidence in the
ultimate success of its efforts. But the opening of negotiations
between the belligerents does not necessarily imply the immediate
cessation of hostilities. Negotiations for peace are not always the
result of a suspension of arms; on the contrary, they more frequently
precede the establishment of a truce. Have not Plenipotentiaries often
been known to assemble, exchange communications, agree upon all the
essential clauses of treaties--nay, even decide the question of peace or
war--while the military leaders continued the struggle and endeavoured
to the last moment to mollify the conditions of peace by the force of
arms? To take only one instance in the history of the United
States--the negotiations which established their independence commenced
long before hostilities had ceased in the New World, and the armistice
was only established by the instrument of the 30th of November, 1782,
which, under the title of Provisional Articles, contained by
anticipation the principal clauses of the final treaty of 1783.</p>

<p>Nothing, therefore, would prevent the United States'
Government--without renouncing the advantages it may anticipate from
the continuation of the war--from entering into negotiations with the
Southern Confederates, supposing the Confederates themselves are
willing. Representatives, or commissioners of the two sides, could meet
at a given place, which it might be desirable to declare neuter for
that purpose. The complaints of both might be examined at this
meeting. Instead of the accusations at present interchanged between
North and South, a discussion of the interests which divide them would
be substituted. They would determine, by regular and comprehensive
deliberation, whether these interests are definitively
irreconcilable; whether separation is an extremity which can no longer be avoided; or
whether the recollections of a common existence and the ties of every
kind which have made North and South one and the same Federal State and
raised it to such a height of prosperity are not more powerful than
the causes which have induced the two populations to take up arms.</p>

<p>A negotiation, the object of which was thus determined, would not
carry with it any of the objections urged against a diplomatic
intervention of Europe; and without giving rise to the same hopes as
the immediate conclusion of an armistice, it would exercise a
favourable influence upon the progress of events. Why, therefore, should
not a suggestion which pays all deference to the feelings of the
United States obtain the approbation of the Federal Government?
Persuaded as we are that it is in conformity with their real
interests, we do not hesitate to recommend it to their attention; and,
not having desired to make any ostentatious parade of influence in
the proposed mediation of the maritime Powers, we should rejoice,
without the slightest feeling of <hi rend="italic">amour propre</hi>, at the opening of
negotiations summoning the two populations to discuss the relation of
their differences without the co-operation of Europe. I beg of you to
assure the Washington Cabinet of this in recommending to its wisdom
counsels that are dictated by the most sincere interest in the
prosperity of the United States. You are authorised, moreover, to
leave with Mr. Seward a copy of this despatch, if he wishes to have
one.</p>

<p>The Montreal Company's steamer Hibernian has brought us Boston
journals of the 31st and Canadian of the 30th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Burnside has resigned the command of the army of the
Potomac, and General Hooker has been appointed his successor. Generals
Franklin and Sumner have been relieved of their commands. In their
places General Couch commands the right, General Mead the centre,
General W. F. Smith the left, and General Siegel the reserve. Snow is
six feet deep at Falmouth, and the roads are impassable. General
Burnside's letter of resignation says that the army would, under more
favourable circumstances, have accomplished great results. In General
Hooker's short address on taking command there occurs the following
passage:--</p>
<q><p>In the record of your achievements there is much to be proud of,
and with the blessing of God we will contribute something to the
renown of our arms and the success of our cause. To secure these ends
your commander will require the cheerful and zealous co-operation of
every officer and soldier in this army. In equipment, intelligence,
and valour the enemy is our inferior. Let us never hesitate to give
him battle, wherever we can find him.</p></q>

<p>General Burnside is to be examined before a Senatorial Committee
concerning the obstacles thrown in his way by inferior
officers. A list has been prepared of more than eighty army officers
who are to be summarily dismissed from the service, for the use of
improper language in reference to their superiors and the
Commander-in-Chief in connection with the removal of General
M'Clellan, and the court-martial and sentence of General Fitz-John
Porter.</p>

<p>General Franklin has demanded a court-martial to inquire into the
alleged charges against him of tardiness and inefficiency.</p>
<p>General Joseph Hooker is a native of Massachusetts. He served in
Mexico on General Pillow's Staff, but resigned after the war. He was
living in California when the war broke out. General Burnside has
retired to his State, Rhode Island, where he has been flatteringly
received by his fellow citizens.</p>

<p>The reports that the army of the Potomac is much "demoralised" by
the attitude taken by the Democratic party are confirmed.</p>
<p>General Foster's (Federal) army in North Carolina has had a slight
advantage, and was advancing in two columns in Wilmington and
Kingston.</p>

<p>From Port Royal we hear that a naval conflict was impending between
the Federal gun-boat Montauk and the Confederate ram Fingal, said to
be guarding the steamer Nashville.</p><pb n="167"/>

<p>Accounts from Havannah report extensive depredations upon the
American shipping in the West Indies by the Confederate steamer Orete,
now called the Florida. Great consternation prevailed among the
American captains in the West Indies, and several, whose vessels were
ready for sea, had not ventured to leave port.</p>

<p>A Confederate steamer, supposed to be the Alabama, after a sharp
engagement, sunk the Federal gun-boat Hatteras off Galveston. The
Hatteras sank with all on board, except one officer and five men, who
were picked up by the Brooklyn. The Hatteras was an ironclad carrying
three rifled 32-pounders.</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">En revanche</hi>, the Federals have destroyed the
Confederate iron-clad steamer in Bayoutche. They have also flanked the
Confederate forces in that section.</p>

<p>The Federal forces in the south-west combined for a third attempt
to open the Mississippi have commenced operations near the mouth of
the Yazoo. General M'Clernand has left the Arkansas River and
retraced his course to Young's Point, where it is reported that he has
landed his troops. Generals Grant, Sherman, and Gorian will unite in
the operations. General M'Clernand's troops have recommenced work in
the canal dug some months ago by the negroes under General Williams,
with the intention of diverting the channel of the Mississippi from
the bed of the river opposite Vicksburg.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>The financial bill framed by the Committee of Ways and Means has
passed the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>The chief subject of discussion had been the enlistment of negro
regiments, to which the Opposition are bitterly opposed. They have
hitherto prevented any vote being taken on the subject.</p>

<p>In the Senate, Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, was given into custody
for using the phrase "that imbecile Lincoln." On being arrested by
the Sergeant-at-Arms he drew forth a revolver, uttering threats
against the Chairman and Mr. Sumner. The next day a resolution was
brought forward to expel him from the Senate, but it was dropped on
his apologising for his misconduct.</p>

<p>Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, has obtained permission from the
President to raise companies of persons of African descent, "organised
into a separate corps," for garrison and other duty within the
State.</p>

<p>The Administration is engaged in preparing to bring before the
Supreme Court of the United States the important question of the power
of the President in times of rebellion to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus. The Administration is determined to settle this question at
once, as there are many cases now pending in several State Courts, and
additional ones are springing up almost daily. The latest is the
arrest of Mr. Boileau, editor and proprietor of the Philadelphia
<hi rend="italic">Evening Journal</hi> on the charge of a treasonable article on Jefferson
Davis's Message. His case is warmly espoused by the Democratic party in
the State Legislature, and by the grand jury of the county of
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. Lincoln has replied to the address adopted at "the meeting of
the working men" held at the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, at the close
of last year. The President deplores the sufferings to which the
cotton famine has given rise, but rejoices at the failure of the
efforts of "disloyal American citizens" to induce the operatives on
this side of the Atlantic to favour the attempt to establish a
Government resting "exclusively on the basis of human slavery." He
regards the "decisive utterances" of the gathering presided over
by Mr. Abel Heywood "as an instance of sublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any
country," and he trusts that the sentiments expressed in the
address will be sustained by the English nation. He further "hails
this interchange of sentiment as an augury that, whatever
else may happen, the peace and friendship which now exist between
the two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them,
perpetual."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General Lee.</hi></p>
<p>Our Artist in the Confederate camp, near Fredericksburg, has
forwarded to us a Portrait of General Lee, Commander of the
Confederate army in Northern Virginia, which is here reproduced. The
Richmond correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> writes as
follows respecting him:--</p>
<p>"General Lee is, I believe, between fifty and sixty years of age,
but wears his years well, and strikes you as the incarnation of health
and endurance as he rears his erect soldierlike form from his seat by
the fireside to greet courteously the stranger. His manner is calm and
stately, his presence impressive and imposing; his dark brown eyes are
remarkably direct and honest as they meet you fully and firmly,
inspiring great confidence. The shape and type of the head a little
resemble Garibaldi's, and the features are those of a much handsomer
man. On the rare occasions when he smiles, and on the still rarer
occasions when he laughs heartily, disclosing a fine unbroken row of
white firm-set teeth, the confidence and sympathy which he inspires
are irresistible. A child thrown among a knot of strangers would be
inevitably drawn to General Lee first in the company, and would run to
claim his protection. His voice is fine and deep but slightly
monotonous in its tone. Altogether, the most winning attribute of the
General is his unaffected childlike guilelessness. It is very rare that
a man of his age, conversant with important events, and thrown to the
surface of mighty convulsions, retains the impress of a simple
ingenuous nature to so eminent a degree. It is impossible to converse
with him for ten minutes without perceiving how deeply he has
meditated upon all the possible eventualities of the campaign in
Virginia, and how sound and well-considered are the positions which he
advances. It is obvious that the most entire and trusting confidence
is placed in General Lee by his subordinate officers, whose respect
and affection he seems thoroughly to have won."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General "Stonewall"
Jackson.</hi></p>

<p>Although a Portrait of General "Stonewall" Jackson has appeared in
this Journal, we offer no excuse for presenting another of the
redoubtable hero from a sketch recently taken by our Special Artist in
the Confederate camp, Northern Virginia, where General Jackson is at
present located. Appended are a few particulars concerning him from
the authority which we have just quoted:--</p>

<p>"At a distance of seven miles from General Lee's head-quarters,
near the little village of Bunkerhill, were the head-quarters of
General 'Stonewall' Jackson. I had been taught to expect a morose,
reserved, distant reception; I found the most genial, courteous, and
forthcoming of companions. A bright piercing blue eye, a slightly
aquiline nose, a thin, tall sinewy frame 'made all over of pinwire,' a
great disregard of dress and appearance--these are the characteristics
of General Jackson's exterior. There is also about him every direct
and honest look. The disappointing circumstance is that his voice,
which is rapid in its utterance, is weak and
unimpressive. Passionately attached to the Valley of Virginia, which
has for so long been the principal scene of his achievements, idolised
by the inhabitants of Winchester and of the valley, General Jackson
has acquired such a fame in that entire neighbourhood that it is sad
to think what would happen if the one life round which such prestige
clings should yield to a stray bullet or to the chance of
disease. Sinewy and wiry as the General seems, it is impossible not to
fancy that he is wearing himself terribly by his restless, sleepless
activity, by his midnight marches, and by the asceticism of his
life. The respect and consciousness of his presence, and what that
presence means, exhibited by his staff, impressed me very strongly,
and seemed to exceed the respect exhibited towards General Lee ....As
there are many conflicting reports about the origin of the name of
'Stonewall,' it may be interesting to repeat the true circumstances
under which it was given. In the first battle of Manassas, on July
21, 1861, General Bee, of South Carolina (himself subsequently
killed in the same action), observing his men flinching and
wavering, called out to them to stand firm, exclaiming, 'Look at
Jackson's men; they stand like a stone wall!' In his official report of
the battle, General Beauregard employed the same expression in
connection with General Jackson's command, and the name has clung to
General Jackson ever since."</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson Jackson was born in Virginia about the year
1825.</p></div2>

<p>There is nothing important from the army of the Potomac.</p>
<p>In a slight affair near the Blackwater, Virginia, the 167th
Pennsylvania Regiment, composed of draughted men, refused to fight, and
lay down upon the ground during the entire engagement, saying, "You
can draught us; but you cannot make us fight."</p>
<p>General Foster's expedition from Beaufort had been seen off Cape
Fear, en route for Port Royal.</p>

<p>On the 31st ult. two Confederate iron-clad gun-boats, accompanied
by three steamers, went out from Charleston at one o'clock in the
morning and attacked the blockading squadron. The engagement commenced
at four o'clock. The Confederate gun-boats sank the Federal gunboat
Mercedita, carrying eleven guns, and another Federal gun-boat whose
name is unknown. They disabled the Federal steamer Quaker City, but
she escaped with the loss of one wheel. The attacking party set four
Federal vessels on fire. The blockading fleet consisted of thirteen
vessels, with two first-class frigates. The Confederate gun-boats
returned to Charleston, where they were received with enthusiasm.
Commander Ingraham officially reported that the blockading fleet had
gone out of sight. General Beauregard then issued a proclamation
reciting the discomfiture and dispersion of the hostile fleet, and
formally declaring that the blockade of Charleston by the United
States was raised on and after the 31st of January. The General placed
steamers at the disposal of the foreign Consuls to see for themselves
that no blockade existed. The British Consul went on board the
steamer Petrel, five miles beyond the usual anchorage of the
blockaders, but could see nothing of them with glasses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, four vessels of the Federal fleet reappeared
late on the evening of the 31st, and on Feb. 1 twenty blockading
vessels were off Charleston bar.</p>

<p>The Confederate Secretary of State has notified to the British
and French Consuls the raising of the Charleston blockade.</p>

<p>The Southern journals announce that the Federal gun-boat P. Smith,
carrying eleven guns and 230 men, surrendered unconditionally to the
Confederates at Stone River. The Federal Navy Department had received
a despatch announcing that her capture ensued upon her running
ashore.</p>

<p>The British steamer Princess Royal was captured by a fleet of Union
gun-boats while attempting to run the blockade into Charleston with
a valuable cargo from Halifax. She had on board six hundred barrels of
powder, two Armstrong guns, a large lot of machinery, sheet
iron, steam-batteries, hardware, boots, coffee, tin, and other
valuables. A party of English workmen skilled in the manufacture of
projectiles were also captured in the Princess Royal.</p>

<p>There are contradictory reports of the result of the expedition up
the Ogechee River, in Georgia. Southern reports state that the
ironclad Montauk was badly injured in her turret by the guns of
Fort M'Allister and compelled to haul off. The Federal Navy Department states
that the Montauk remained four hours under fire without receiving
any injury.</p>

<p>General Bank's expedition had left New Orleans. Its supposed destination is Port Hudson.</p>
<p>General Magruder officially announces on the 4th inst. that
Galveston was open to trade; but Federal Commodore Bell has issued a
counter proclamation declaring Galveston, Sabine Pass, and the whole
of the Texas coast blockaded, and warning vessels from trading under
penalty of capture.</p>

<p>The bombardment of Galveston by the Federals had commenced, but the result is not yet known.</p>

<p>General Grant had arrived at Vicksburg. The works on the canal were
progressing. The Confederates have planted a battery commanding the
lower end of the canal.</p>

<p>Colonel Stewart, chief of the cavalry on General M'Clernand's staff
at Vicksburg, whilst out on a reconnaissance with two hundred men, was
shot and deserted by them. Colonel Stewart had upon his person a
memorandum-book containing full estimates of the number and calibre of
the forces and guns of Generals Sherman and M'Clernand, and much useful
information, including projects respecting canals, upon which work has
been commenced. This book fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Confederates have attacked Fort Donnelson and captured a
battery, afterwards regained by the Federals, who repulsed the
Confederates with heavy loss.</p>

<p>From the Cumberland River, Tennessee, further atrocities committed on
unarmed negro and mulatto men are reported. The coloured cabin-boys
and cooks captured on board some Federal steamers taken at Harpeth
Shoals, in the Cumberland River, were taken to an open field and shot
in cold blood. Two others got down by the rudder of the steamer and
held on with only their heads above water. They were discovered by the
Confederates, and several soldiers were ordered into a skiff, who rowed
close up to them and blew out their brains. The life of a chambermaid
was saved with difficulty by the clerk of the steamer claiming her as
his slave when he was removing into Kentucky.</p>

<p>The surviving officers and crew of the Federal steamer Hatteras,
sunk off Galveston, had been landed by the Alabama at Port Royal,
Jamaica. It appears, however, that the Hatteras sank so quickly that
forty-three of her crew were drowned before they could be removed.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>The report of the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury has been
published. The receipts for the year 1862 were 457,855,704 dols., and
the expenditure 416,971,735 dols., leaving a balance of over
40,000,000 dols. The expenses for the War Department were 340,000,000
dols., and for the Navy 20,000,000 dols.</p>

<p>The Governor of North Carolina is acting upon those principles of
State rights on which the Confederate Government is founded. He
insisted on the recall of a number of the State troops from Richmond
to protect the State. This demand has induced President Davis to have
an interview with the refractory Governor, in order to persuade him to
bring his policy into harmony with that of the Richmond
Government.</p>

<p>The military commanders of Georgia, and the Governors of North
Carolina and Alabama, have issued appeals to the people not to flinch
from their duty to the South in her hour of peril, and cautioning them
that attempts to evade the conscription will be punished with
rigour.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Congress.</hi></p>

<p>After six days of factious opposition--called in American
Parliamentary terminology "filibustering"--a vote was permitted to be
taken on the bill for arming the negroes. It passed the House of
Representatives by a vote of 83 to 54. The numbers to be armed are
left to the President's discretion. No slaves of loyal owners are to
be thus employed. No recruiting-offices are to be opened in Delaware,
Maryland, Western Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, or Tennessee, without
the permission of the Governors of those States. Their rations,
clothing, and equipments are to be the same as for other soldiers;
but privates are not to receive more than ten dollars per month; that
is, half the pay of the whites.</p>

<p>In the Senate the resolutions denouncing French intervention in
Mexico were laid on the table by a vote of 34 against 9.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury has informed the Senate that a
reduction of the duty upon paper would increase the Government
revenue.</p>

<p>In the House of Representatives the Bankrupt Bill has been laid
upon the table by a vote of 60 to 53, and the motion to reconsider it
was also voted to be tabled by the same majority. The United States
have no bankruptcy acts.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>Mr. Cameron, of Pennsylvania, late Secretary of War in
Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet, and now holding the appointment of United
States' Minister at the Russian Court, is charged by a Democratic
member of the Pennsylvanian Legislature with offering him a bribe of
25,000 dols. to vote for Cameron as United States' senator instead of
Mr.<pb n="191"/> Buckalew, the nominee of the Democratic party. The
charge, to which no denial has been made, creates great excitement
throughout the country, and is used as the means of discrediting the
Federal Administration.</p>

<p>The Republican candidate, ex-Governor Morgan, has been elected United States' senator from New York.</p>

<p>The editor of the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Journal</hi> has been released, after
making an humble apology to the Federal Government, and giving a
province of amendment for the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Stafford, the inventor of a shell named after himself, has
succeeded in driving one of his projectiles entirely through the iron
plating and halfway through the wood of a target representing a
complete section of the British frigate Warrior. It exploded in the
target, shattering it seriously. Afterwards a solid shot was driven
entirely through the target, penetrating the earth beyond five or six
feet; and all this was accomplished with a smaller charge of powder
than is used with any but a Dahlgren nut.</p>

<p>Napoleon's letter to General Forey, announcing the policy of France
to be opposed to the future annexation of Mexico to the United States,
has elicited angry articles from the New York press.</p>

<p>The New York Legislature and Chamber of Commerce have passed
resolutions in favour of the emancipation policy and pledging their
support to the Administration.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL J.E.B. STUART.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> accompanying Portrait of the dashing
cavalry officer, General Stuart--the Murat of the Confederates; their
Prince Rupert, with more than that Prince's success--cannot fail to be
of interest to our readers. It is from a Sketch by our Special Artist
in the Confederate camp, Northern Virginia, to which General Stuart is
attached. Appended are some remarks respecting the General by the
Richmond correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>:--"While in
the Shenandoah Valley the achievements of General Jackson have aroused
towards him a generous feeling of gratitude for danger averted and
prosperity preserved it is doubtful whether east of the Blue Ridge the
twenty-nine years of General Stuart, added to that indefatigable
energy which teaches him, after he has ridden fifty miles during the
day, to regard it as his highest happiness to ride a dozen more miles
at night 'to tread but one measure' in a Virginian country-house, do
not incline the scale, especially if the balance be adjusted by fair
hands, in favour of the younger General. There have been many English
officers, particularly in the East Indian service, whose endurance in
the saddle has been regarded as unequalled; but I doubt whether any
Englishman ever exhibited such superiority to bodily fatigue as is
almost nightly evinced by the gay cavalier who knows every hospitable
roof within a dozen miles of his head-quarters (and what roof is not
hospitable?), and, accompanied by his banjo-player, visits them by
turns night after night, returning usually to his hard-earned rest long
after the midnight hour has flown. With the earliest dawn of morning
the first voice calling gaily for breakfast is that of the midnight
merrymaker, who rises the picture of health, goodhumour, and
strength. It may be noticed en passant that to the circumstance that he
has never touched tobacco in any form, or any wine or other liquor,
General Stuart attributes much of his health and vigour. Certainly so
jovial a company as is assembled at General Stuart's head-quarters it
has never been my fortune to see parallelled in either the Federal or
the Confederate camps."</p>

<p>In the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> of Tuesday appeared a letter
from its special correspondent at the head-quarters of General Stuart,
near Fredericksburg, Virginia, dated Jan. 1, containing an account of
another of Stuart's raids of which some particulars had previously
reached us:--"The return this evening of General Stuart and his staff
has shed a glow of cheerfulness throughout the camp, and has afforded
much merriment by reason of the incidents which accompanied this
expedition, and of which every one is talking. It appears that General
Stuart started upon Christmas Eve with a considerable force of cavalry
in the direction of Dumfries, distant about thirty miles from these
head-quarters. Thence he proceeded towards Occoquan Creek, where, as
well as at Dumfries, he had skirmishes with the enemy, during which he
took about 200 prisoners, and inflicted some loss upon them, himself
sustaining the loss of only one man, Captain Bullock (a very gallant
officer), who, it is feared, was mortally wounded. After crossing
Occoquan Creek, General Stuart struck the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad, and at Burke's station burst into the room where the
telegraph operator was at work, and commanded him, upon pain of
instant death if he misinterpreted, to read off the messages which the
click of the instrument pronounced to be at that moment passing along
the wires. In this manner General Stuart learnt the movements which
General Heintzelman and other Federal Generals were concerting with a
view to intercept his retreat, and altered his course so as to baffle
their preparations. The luckless telegraph operator and his
fellow-prisoners--all of them dismounted cavalry soldiers--were
started off on foot to walk forty-five miles to Culpepper station, in
order that they might learn by practical experience what a long and
weary travel was requisite to carry them to that Richmond which they
have been so long in reaching. The submarine telegraph clock found at
Burke's station is now a valuable acquisition at General Stuart's
head-quarters, and will probably be the guide by which many a future
<hi rend="italic">reveill&#xE9;e</hi> and tattoo will be
sounded. After leaving Burke's station General Stuart proceeded
towards Alexandria, within eight miles of which town he turned towards
the north-west, and returned hither by a circuit which brought him
through Warrenton--which town was occupied by a large body of Yankee
cavalry a few hours after General Stuart had passed through it--and
Culpepper, thus concluding an expedition less important, but not less
successful, than its predecessors."</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY</hi> 21,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Diogenes</hi> was held to have played the part
of a wise and honest citizen when, the city being in a state of
general excitement, he rolled his tub about in a vehement manner, and,
being questioned as to his object, said that it did not become a man
to be quiet when every one else was in agitation. But his conduct
would have been less philosophical had the cynic performed his
acrobatic feat simply because there was a great disturbance in some
city a hundred miles off. And herein is the difference between the
Greek sage and certain English sages who are just now rolling their
tubs furiously because the United States are in perturbation. There is
no necessity for such a demonstration, and consequently it becomes
ludicrous instead of imposing, or even respectable.</p>

<p>Were there any question at issue upon which the opinion of England
was asked, there would be a reason for the meetings and orations which
a numerous but not an influential class is now assembling and
emitting. But what call is there upon England to interfere in the
American quarrel? Has it not been the great praise of the Government
that it expressed the views of the respectable and thinking portion of
the population by declaring at the outset, and by reiterating the
declaration, even from the Throne itself, that we had nothing to do
with the struggle? Why, at the eleventh hour, and when there is every
chance of the Americans adjusting the matter in their own way, by
bringing a disastrous war to an end and allowing the South to go free,
are thousands of Englishmen to be suddenly called together to lend
what moral aid they can to one side by declaring that they hate
slavery? Do we not all hate slavery? Has not the nation made the
greatest sacrifices in proof of that hatred, that in 1863 we should
require Exeter Hall certificates to our character? If these meetings
and spoutings are simply intended to place the English nation right in
the eyes o[f] the world upon the subject of slavery they are needless
and impertinent; but if, as would seem to be the case, they are
designed to bolster up the unlucky ex-attorney who has been placed at
the head of the federal provinces of America, the sudden and foolish
intervention is an act of presumption which deserves severer
language. The Crown, the Legislature, and all the classes whence
springs what is really public opinion, have solemnly and repeatedly
declared that we will not interfere. And until the North was reduced
to a conviction that it must shortly give in, and that peace must be
signed, there was no attempt to violate the agreement which we had all
made. Now, while the respectable part of the Americans themselves are
busily devising schemes for ending the war without loss of honour,
great crowds of Englishmen are brought together and are asked to join
in a great shout to Mr. Lincoln to go on with the slaughter. It is,
therefore, to be desired that dispassionate journals should assure
both Europe and America that such manifestations, however loud may be
the talk and however dense may be the gathering, have no real
significance. The educated classes and the mass of the people are
alike opposed to such impertinence. The nothingness of the leaders of
the new agitation is, of course, notorious to English readers; but we
may, with advantage, assure other persons that there is no one who
takes the lead in these scenes who has the slightest claim to any
other distinction.</p>

<p>At the same time it is right to add that, though foolish persons
have permitted themselves to be excited into a rather remarkable
display of folly, and are rolling their tubs when there is not the
least occasion for such gymnastics, there is a certain extenuation of
their conduct to be found in the fact that others have gone much too
far in defence of the South. There have been promulgated a great many
doctrines on the side of the Confederates which by no means express
the sentiments of this country. We never for a single moment tolerate
slavery as an institution to be preserved. We go no further than to
accept it as a fact to be dealt with wisely and humanely. It was
accepted as such a fact by our own Legislature when it was resolved to
terminate the system, and when the present Earl of Derby had allotted
to him the noble task which he discharged so well. We wish to see
slavery extinct in American as in English territory; but we have never
been so cruelly unjust to our American brethren as to insist that they
should run where we only walked. We took time--many years--to arrange
our plans; we spread emancipation over a long period of
apprenticeship, and we provided large funds for compensating those
whom we had permitted to believe themselves in possession of
"property." Nor have we ever ventured to call upon the South to go
faster. We have indeed recognised the peculiar reasons why the action
of the South in this matter must be slower than our own. This,
however, is as far as we have gone in our toleration of slavery, and
those who would go further, and contend for it as an institution to be
conserved instead of an affliction to be endured, do not speak the
sentiments of Englishmen. Mr. Tennyson has told us eloquently of "the
falsehood of extremes;" and one extreme begets another. The wise man
is not irritated into exaggerations on one side because an opponent
exaggerates on the other; but the judicial faculty is not a common
one, and certainly it would not be a point of wisdom to expect the
exercise of such a faculty from those who bawl and groan in Exeter
Hall, which, as Lord Macaulay said, hath brayed. Still, we desire to
note that there has been some provocation for the outcry, and it will
be well that such provocation should cease. The South will, probably,
ere long be a nation, and will exchange diplomatic communications with
the Foreign Office. There is every reason why such intercourse should
not be impeded by foolish declarations on one side or the other at
home. We shall meet the South on facts, not on opinions. Brazil is a
slave State, but (except when Earl Russell loses his head) we
communicate amicably with Brazil, and yet we are so far from
recognising the desirability of her domestic institution that we sink
her slavers whenever we cannot seize them. The Southern Confederacy
must prepare herself for similar treatment. On the other hand, we
shall congratulate the North on not being a slave State; and,
possibly, we shall suggest to her to give a lively colour to her
professions by treating "niggers" a little better than she seems at
all inclined to do at present.</p>

<p>We have deemed it right to say this because the <hi rend="smallcaps">Illustrated London News</hi> makes its way into every
part of the civilised world, and is read where the ordinary journal of
a foreign nation is neither seen nor cared for. We desire that a
dispassionate statement of the real feeling of the people of England
should go forth to those who may look for such a statement in vain in
the columns of party strife. In brief, the case is this. England hates
slavery as strongly as ever; but she loves fair play, and is not such a
Pharisee as to pretend to more virtue than she has shown, or to demand
that a slave State should move faster than she herself
moved.</p></div2>

<p>The steam-ship Gibraltar, better known as the Sumter, has again
eluded the vigilance of the Federal officers. Some time ago, it is
understood, the Sumter was sold to an English firm, and was rechristened
the Gibraltar; but, notwithstanding this, she has for some months
past been strictly blockaded at "the Rock" by a Northern cruiser, whose
commander is alleged to have declared that it was his intention to
seize her if possible, no matter what change of ownership might have
taken place. By a clever ruse, however, the Gibraltar got safely away a
short time ago, and is now lying quietly moored in the
Mersey.</p></div2>

<p>From the army of the Potomac we hear that General Burnside is to
detach an army of 35,000 men and proceed to Suffolk by way of Fortress
Monroe.</p>
<p>General Foster's expedition was disembarking at Helena Island, off
the coast of South Carolina.</p>
<p>Rumours are rife of disputes between Generals Foster and Hunter,
the General in command of the department. General Foster had returned
to Washington for further instructions.</p>

<p>The official reports of the Confederate commanders, Ingraham and
Tucker, make no mention of the raising of the blockade.</p>
<p>The British Consul at Charleston, Mr. Bunce, left that city for
Havannah on board her Majesty's ship Cadmus.</p>
<p>General Hunter had informed the Confederate authorities of Georgia
that he should hold all prisoners in close confinement and answerable
with their lives for the safety of the Federal officers captured by
the Confederates until President Davis's retaliation proclamation was
withdrawn.</p>
<p>The Federal ram Queen of the West ran the gauntlet of the
Confederate batteries on the Mississippi. She met and sank three
steamers with provisions for the garrison at Vicksburg, and took 56
prisoners.</p>
<p>The Federals have cut the levees on the eastern side of the
Mississippi, twelve miles above Helena, at Yazoo Pass, and at two
other places. Their object is to lay the surrounding region under
water, so as to allow their gunboats to get to the rear of
Vicksburg.</p>

<p>An Illinois regiment, attached to General Grant's army, had been
placed under arrest for refusing to fight under the emancipation
proclamation.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>Mr. Seward has replied to M. Drouyn de Lhuys' note suggesting a
conference between the Federals and Confederates. The reply is firm
and peremptory in declining the proposal. Its spirit may be gathered
from the following paragraph:--</p>
<q><p>On the other hand, as I have already intimated, this Government
has not the least thought of relinquishing the trust which has been
confided to it by the nation under the most solemn of all political
sanctions; and if it had any such thought, it would have still
abundant reason to know that peace, proposed at the cost of
dissolution, would be immediately, universally, and indignantly
rejected by the American people. It is a great mistake that European
statesmen make if they suppose this people are demoralised. Whatever, in case of an insurrection, the people of
France, or Great Britain, or Switzerland, or of the Netherlands,
would do to save their national existence, no matter how the strife
might be regarded by or affect foreign nations, just so much, and
certainly no less, the people of the United States will do, if
necessary, to save for the common benefit the region which is bounded
by the Pacific and Atlantic coasts, and by the shores of the Gulfs of
St. Lawrence and Mexico, together with the free and common navigation
of the Rio Grande, Missouri, Arkansas, Mississippi, Ohio,
St. Lawrence, Hudson, Delaware, Potomac, and other national
highways by which this land, which to them is at once a land of
inheritance and a land of promise, is opened and watered.</p></q>

<p>A despatch of M. Mercier, the French Minister at Washington, in
which he informed M. Thouvenel that his visit to Richmond was fully
acquiesced in, and even encouraged, by Mr. Seward, having been
published in the French <hi rend="italic">Livre Jaune</hi>, the United
States' Senate passed a resolution requesting the President to inform
them as to what had passed between M. Mercier and Mr. Seward. This
resolution has drawn forth a categorical reply from Mr. Seward, which
denies that he at all encouraged M. Mercier to visit Richmond.</p>

<p>The Senate had adopted resolutions asking the President for any
information of which he may be in possession relative to the employment
of negroes by the French in Mexico. The Senate has also passed the
bill for compensating Missouri for her slaves in the event of her
emancipating them, and a bill taxing the bank circulation 1 per cent
for two years and 2 per cent thereafter.</p>

<p>A deputation of the leading publishers and journalists was at
Washington, endeavouring to procure a total repeal of the duties on
paper, which now amounts to 35 per cent on the value, which, during
the present high rate of exchange on Europe, is a prohibitory tax.</p>
<p>A bill to enlarge the Illinois and New York canals has been
defeated in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The movements in indirect opposition to the war continue. The
Illinois Legislature, by a vote of 52 against 28, have passed peace
and conference resolutions. The Republican Governor of Pennsylvania
has sent a message to the State Legislature condemning arbitrary
arrests. Mr. Horace Greeley, the editor of the <hi rend="italic">New
York Tribune</hi>, an emancipationist journal, declares in favour of
entertaining proposals for peace if, at the end of another three
months, the "rebellion"
remains in full vigour.</p>
<p>The Illinois Legislature, exasperated by the defeat of the Canal
Enlargement Bill in Congress, have resolved to direct the Governor to
appoint commissioners to the Canadian Parliament to concert measures
for the improvement of the means of transportation to the Atlantic, by
way of the St. Lawrence route.</p>

<p>General Fremont has applied to be employed upon active service.</p>
<p>Nicholas Longworth, the celebrated Ohio manufacturer of native
wines--particularly Catawba--died at Cincinnati on the 9th inst., in
the eighty-first year of his age.</p>
<p>New York has been much exalted by the marriage, at a fashionable
church in Broadway, of "General Tom Thumb," twenty-five years of age,
31 in. high, and weighing 29 lb., to Lavinia Warren, a native of
Massachusetts, twenty-one years of age and 32 in. high. The brideman
was a still more diminutive specimen of humanity, 29 in. high,
weighing 25 lb., and nicknamed "Commodore Nutt." The bridemaid was a
sister of the bride, weighing only 19 lb. and measuring 25 in., though
aged sixteen years. The little couple are about to make the "grand
tour" through Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. Webb, the great New York shipbuilder, has published a letter in
which he denies having continued the construction of the ship General
Admiral for the Russian Government during the pendency of the Russian
War. He adverts to the fact that this vessel was not launched until

<p>The anniversary banquet in commemoration of the birthday of George
Washington was celebrated on Monday evening, at St. James's
Hall. General Vandenbergh was in the chair. His Excellency the
American Minister, the Hon. C. F. Adams, in responding to the toast of
"The Union," said the the South had entered upon a career, whether for
glory or for shame posterity would determine. But, whatever their
objects might be, they could not claim George Washington in support of
their principles. A strong anti-slavery speech was made by Judge
Winter, of Georgia. Among the English guests were the members for
Brighton, Professor Newman, and others. The banquet was graced by the

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Charleston Harbour.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">THE</hi> war which has raged so long and
fiercely throughout the States began, as our readers are aware, by the
bombardment, just two years ago, of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbour,
South Carolina--a bloodless engagement, little indicative of the seas
of blood which were and, it is to be feared, still are to be
shed. Public attention has been again directed in a special manner to
Charleston on account of the recent dashing attack of Confederate
gun-boats on the Federal blockading squadron off the harbour,
and by reason also of the news just received that a formidable land and
naval expedition was about to attack Charleston forthwith. We give,
therefore, in this week's Impression a View of the Entrance to
Charleston Harbour, from a sketch recently taken inside the harbour
by our Special Artist, and forwarded to England by one of the many
vessels which are continually breaking the blockade. We remark, in
passing, that some of the sketches of our Special Artist in the
Southern camp which have from time to time fallen into the hands of
the Federals figure in the New York illustrated journals, and the
question naturally arises--might they not as well have been handed
over to their owners for publication?</p>

<p>Charleston is built on a low point of land between the Rivers
Ashley and Cooper, which unite immediately below and form a spacious
and convenient harbour communicating with the ocean at Sullivan's
Island, about seven miles from the city. The main entrance to the
harbour is divided by Fort Sumter, founded upon an artificial island,
while on the right hand is Sullivan's Island, on the left Morris
Island, and beyond Fort Sumter, midway to the city of Charleston, is
Castle Pinckney. A vessel thus going to Fort Sumter would have to run
the gauntlet of a double fire. Fort Sumter is a modern truncated
pentagonal fort, three miles and three-eighths from the city of
Charleston.  The walls are of solid brick and concrete masonry, built
close to the edge of the water. They are 60 ft. high, and from 8
ft. to 12 ft. thick. They are pierced for three tiers of guns on the
north, east, and west sides. It is designed for one hundred and forty
pieces of ordnance. Two tiers of the guns are under bombproof
casemates; the upper tier is open, or en barbette. Fort Moultrie is
distant from Sumter a mile and a half. It is nothing more than a large
water battery. Its armament is eleven heavy guns and several
mortars. The walls are of brick, and present a solid mass of about 13
ft. Cumming's Point Iron Battery is the nearest point of land to Fort
Sumter, being only 1150 yards distant. The iron battery here erected
is made of railroad-iron. The roof slants towards the ground, so that
shots will glance over it as they strike at an obtuse angle. Fort
Johnson is a series of batteries protected by standworks, and are
armed with mortar and siege guns. They are one mile and a quarter from
Fort Sumter. Castle Pinckney is situated on the southern extremity of
Shute's Folly Island, between Hog Island and Charleston city. It is
about three miles from Sumter, and is the north-west. It has two rows
of guns, the lower bombproof casements, the upper en barbette. The height
of the rampart is 20 ft., and the width 32 ft. The armament is
twenty-five guns. Batteries were thrown upon Morris Island at the
beginning of the war, commanding the entrance of Charleston
Harbour. Stone Point is on Morris Island, and faces the sea. It
consequently commands the entrance to the harbour. There are about
9 ft. of water at low tide at Stone Point.</p>

<p>These particulars of Charleston Harbour are necessarily exceedingly
imperfect, and must be taken with much reservation, as they were
gathered at the outset of the war, since which time, of course, the
defences named have been greatly strengthened and many others probably
added. Touching these points, any information concerning which would
have been of deep interest, our Artist, "incommunicable elf," preserves
a profound silence, on the plea--a valid one, doubtless--that he was
bound in honour not to divulge secrets entrusted to him in
confidence. We must content ourselves, therefore, with some
particulars of the present condition of the defences of Charleston
Harbour from a letter by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent at Charleston, who
also evidently writes with a reticent pen:--</p>

<q><p>To assert that Charleston, in its present attitude, is
impregnable would obviously be a ludicrous fallacy; but it is none the
less true that it could not be taken without an enormous force
attacking simultaneously by sea and land, and that the attack, even in
that case, would have to be conducted with desperate valour before it
could be successful. At the entrance of the harbour Fort Sumter,
thoroughly repaired and mounting enormous guns en barbette, frowns at
the blockaders, while the neighbouring points, on Morris Island and
Sullivan's Island, from which the memorable attack upon the fort on
the 13th Of April, 1861, was conducted are in possession of the
Confederates, and are not likely to pass out of their hands. Behind
Fort Sumter a new fort, which takes its name from General Ripley, and
is built almost entirely of palmetto-wood, enhances the difficulty to
which ships are exposed in approaching the town. . . . To return to
Charleston, although for obvious reasons I do not feel myself at
liberty to enter into details with regard to its fortifications, it
may be stated that all that two of the most accomplished engineer
officers of the Confederacy--Generals Lee and Beauregard--could
suggest or devise has been done to strengthen the town on its land
side.  General Lee, before he was moved to Virginia and assumed his
present high position, was for some time in command of Charleston, and
by him the first line of land defences was planned and executed. This
line has grown and expanded at the inspiration of General Beauregard
into a perfect network of earthworks and redoubts, reaching from the
Cooper River on the north to the Ashley River on the south. It is not
likely that so scientific an engineer as General Beauregard would be
fully satisfied with his system of defences until he had spent four or
five years in perfecting them. Suffice it to say that, in the opinion
of competent judges, they are sufficiently strong to defy a force ten
times stronger than is ever likely to be brought against them. In
addition to this, a very slight acquaintance with the country in the
neighbourhood of Charleston satisfies the spectator how impossible it
is for an invading army to penetrate such lagoons and swamps and
forests as lie between the frequent rivers which intersect the surface
of South Carolina. I had occasion last week to go to Pocataligo, about
half way between Charleston and Savannah, to inspect the battle-field
on which the Federals recently encountered a very inferior force, and
were by them routed and driven back to their gunboats. Between
Pocataligo and Charleston a dozen low-lying swampy rivers, such as the
Ashepoo, the Combahee, the North and South Edisto, and many more, find
their way to the sea, and along their banks the far-famed rice
plantations of South Carolina present their glistening, unctuous
surface to the sun, and scarcely afford foothold to anything heavier
then a foxhound. On the highest ridge of land between these rivers the
sandy soil is covered with a growth of pinewood, which is everywhere
fringed with a dense undergrowth of evergreen shrubs. Everywhere
the beautiful evergreen water oak, which resembles our English ilex,
but grows to a far larger size, delights the eye, and is covered on
every branch with long weepers of parasitical moss, which give to the forest
trees a weirdlike aspect, as of giants with hoary, streaming
beards. It is through such a country as this that an invading army
would have to advance to attack Charleston from the land side.</p></q>

<p>As regards the efficiency of the blockade which clutches the
throat of Charleston Harbour, the same correspondent writes as
follows:--</p>

<q><p>If the efficiency of a blockade be tested by the frequency of
the capture of ships attempting egress and ingress, it is a farce to
consider Charleston, Wilmington, Savannah, and Mobile effectually
blockaded. Scarcely a dark night passes but a vessel goes into or out
of one of these ports; and yet it would be difficult, so far as the
number of blockading-vessels is concerned, for any nation to
institute a more restrictive blockade. The truth appears to be that if
it was difficult for any nation to institute an efficient blockade in 
the days of sailing-vessels,--and how difficult it was the British
nation fully learnt in their long war at the beginning of this century
with France--it is almost impossible to do so in these days of
steam. Swift vessels of light draught, painted lead colour, so as to be
scarcely visible at the distance of thirty yards, and consuming coal
which emits only a light, vapoury smoke laugh the blockade to scorn as
they noiselessly emerge from or creep into their sheltering harbours
at a slow, stealthy pace, which is attended by no sound from screw or
paddle. There are vessels which, during this war, have run into and
out of Southern harbours some fifty times, and have scarcely had one
shot fired at them.</p></q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Unsuccessful Attempt To Move The
Federal Army Across<lb/>
the Rappahannock.</hi></p>
<p>A fruitless attempt made by the army of the Potomac to cross the
Rappahannock in January last forms the subject of an Illustration by
our Artist on page 229. A correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New
York Times</hi> supplies the following account:--</p>
<q><p>The night of the 20th of January was a wild Walpurgis night,
such as Goethe paints in the "Faust" while the demons held revel in
the forest of the Brocken. All hopes that it would be a "mere shower"
were presently blasted. It was evident we were in for a regular
north-easter, and among the roughest of that rough type. Yet was
there hard work done that fearful night. One hundred and fifty pieces
of artillery were to be planted in the position selected for them by
General Hunt, Chief of Artillery, a man of rare energy and of a high
order of professional skill. The pontoons, also, were drawn down 
nearer toward the river; but it was dreadful work; the roads
under the influence of the rain were becoming shocking; and by
daylight, when the boats should all have been on the banks, ready to
slide down into the water, but fifteen had been gotten up--not enough
for one bridge, and five were wanted.</p>
<p>The night operations had not escaped the attention of the wary
Confederates. Early in the morning a signal-gun was fired opposite the
ford, reminding one of that other signal-gun fired by them on the
morning of Thursday, the 11th of December, when we began laying the
pontoon opposite Fredericksburg, and which was the token for the
concentration of the whole force at that point. It was indispensable
that we should secure all the advantages of a surprise; and, though
our intention was thus blown to their ears early on Wednesday morning,
we were, nevertheless, forty-eight hours ahead of them, and, with
favourable conditions, should have been able to carry our position
before they could possibly concentrate.</p>
<p>Accordingly a desperate effort was made by the commanding General
to get ready the bridges. It was obvious, however, that, even if
completed, it would be impossible for us, in the condition of the
ground, to get a single piece of artillery up the opposite
acclivity. It would be necessary to rely wholly on the
infantry--indeed, wholly on the bayonet. Happily, if the Confederates
should prove to be in strong force, the country is too thickly wooded
to admit of much generalship, and it was hoped that our superior
weight of metal would carry the day.</p>
<p>The utmost effort was put forth to get pontoons enough into
position to construct a bridge or two. Double and triple teams of
horses and mules were harnessed to each pontoon-boat. It was in
vain. Long, powerful ropes were then attached to the teams, and 150
men were put to the task on each boat. The effort was but little more
successful. They would flounder through the mire for a few feet--the
gang of Lilliputians with their huge-ribbed Gulliver--and then give up
breathless. Night arrived, and the pontoons could not be got up. The
Confederates had discovered what was up, and the pickets on the
opposite bank called over to ours that they "would come over to-morrow
and help us build the bridge."</p>
<p>That night the troops again bivouacked is the same position in the
woods they had held the night before. You can imagine it must have
been a desperate experience--and yet not by any means as bad as might
be supposed. The men were in the woods, which afforded them some
shelter from the wind and rain, and gave then a comparatively dry
bottom to sleep on. Many had brought their shelter-tents, and, making
a flooring of spruce, hemlock, or cedar boughs, and lighting huge
camp-fires, they enjoyed themselves as well as the circumstances would
permit. On the following morning a whisky ration, provided by the
judicious forethought of General Burnside, was on hand for them.</p>
<p>Thursday morning saw the light struggling through an opaque 
envelop of mist, and dawned upon another day of storm and rain. It was
a curious sight presented by the army as we rode over the ground,
miles in extent, occupied by it. One might fancy that some new geologic
cataclysm had o'ertaken the world, and that he saw around him
the elemental wrecks left by another deluge. An indescribable chaos of
pontoons, waggons, and artillery encumbered the road down to the
river--supply-waggons upset by the roadside--artillery "stalled" in the
mud--ammunition-trains mired by the way. Horses and mules dropped down
dead, exhausted with the effort to move their loads through the
hideous medium. A hundred and fifty dead animals, many of them
buried in the liquid muck, were counted in the course of a morning's
ride. And the muddle was still further increased by the bad
arrangements--or, rather, the failure to execute the arrangements that
had been made. It was designed that Franklin's column should advance by
one road and Hooker's by another. But, by mistake, a portion of the
troops of the left grand division debouched into the road assigned
to the centre, and, cutting in between two divisions of one of Hooker's
corps, threw everything into confusion. In consequence, the woods and
roads have for the past two days been filled with stragglers, though
very many of them were involuntary stragglers, and were evidently
honestly seeking to rejoin their regiments. It was now no longer a
question of how to go on; it was a question of how to get
back.</p></q></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Etna we have telegrams from New
York to the morning of the 21st ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>There is nothing new from the army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>The Federal commanders of the vessels blockading Charleston have
forwarded a joint refutation of General Beauregard's report that the
blockade was raised. They declare that they never quitted the
blockading line usually occupied by them, and that no vessel of any
description crossed the bar after the Confederate rams returned to
Charleston. In reference to the alleged statements of the foreign
Consuls and the Commander of the British war steamer Petrel they
say:--</p>
<q><p>If the statement from the papers, as now before us, has the
sanction of the Commander of the Petrel and the foreign Consuls, we
can only deplore that foreign officers can lend their official
positions to the spreading before the world for an unworthy object
untruths patent to every officer of the squadron.</p></q>
<p>General Beauregard has issued a proclamation stating that there
were indications of an early attack on Charleston and Savannah and
urging non-combatants to retire. He also appeals to all ablebodied
Georgians and Carolinians to rush to arms without regard to choice of
weapons. Pikes and scythes, he says, will exterminate their enemies,
and spades and shovels protect their firesides.</p>

<p>General Hunter had assumed the command of the forces lately arrived
at Hilton Head from Beaufort, South Carolina, and General Foster had
returned to North Carolina.</p>
<p>The Governor of Virginia has addressed a letter to President
Lincoln, informing him he would unflinchingly retaliate for any
improper treatment of citizens or soldiers of Virginia.</p>
<p>The Federal turreted gun-boat Indianola has run the Vicksburg blockade of the Mississippi in safety.</p>

<p>The entire Federal fleet was in front of Vicksburg with all the
mortar-boats in position for the attack. The Mississippi having
overflowed its banks on the Louisiana side, the town of De Soto,
opposite Vicksburg, has been submerged, and it is expected the whole
peninsula will soon be under water.</p>
<p>Another Federal expedition has left New Orleans for Bayou Teche. It
is denied that the Harriet Lane had escaped from Galveston.</p>
<p>The Confederate General Hindman's army in Tennessee is said to he
demoralised. Three hundred of his troops were frozen to death in 
marching from Van Buren, in Arkansas.</p>
<p>The Confederate steamer Oroto is blockaded in Kingston, Jamaica, by
two Federal vessels.</p>

<p>There has been a collision between a negro regiment and a portion
of a Maine regiment stationed on Ship Island. The negroes are said
to have fired on the Maine regiment, killing six.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>
<p>The Senate has refused to pass the bill for enlisting 300,000
negroes.</p>
<p>A bill establishing a national system of banking, based on Federal
securities, has passed the House of Representatives, and awaits
President Lincoln's signature to become law.</p>
<p>The Senate has passed a bill authorising the President, in all
domestic and foreign wars, to issue letters of marque. The authority
conferred by the Act is limited to three years. A proposal to grant
this authority for the suppression of the rebellion only was voted
down.</p>
<p>The Senate has also passed a Conscription Bill, rendering all
citizens, and those who have declared their intention to become
citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, liable to
perform military duty when called out by the President. Persons
enrolled are subject for two years to be called into service to serve
for three years, or during the war, on the same footing with the
present volunteers, advance pay and bounty included. The President can
draught at any time, with ten days' notice to draughted
men. Substitutes may be furnished, or commutation made. A motion to
exempt clergymen from the conscription was voted down.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court at Washington is engaged in hearing appeals from
the district Courts relating to the capture of vessels condemned for
trying to run the blockade. The appellants are chiefly British
shipowners.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The Louisiana planters have accepted General Banks's proposal that
negroes who shall return to the plantations and work during the period
of one year shall be compensated by the planters. Negroes refusing
these terms will be employed on public works.</p>
<p>The public are exceedingly mistrustful of the Emperor of the French, and believe that
on the receipt of Mr. Seward's last epistle he will recognise the
independence of the Confederate States. With these preoccupations, the
news of the insurrection in Poland is welcomed, not because it holds
out a prospect of the reconstitution of Polish nationality, but
because it threatens to embroil France and divert the Emperor's
attention and resources from American and Mexican affairs.</p>
<p>The news of the emancipation meeting in Exeter Hall had reached New York, and
had fallen flat on the ear of all except the Abolitionists.</p>
<p>The Democratic members of the next Congress have been invited to meet in
New York on the 8th of March.</p>
<p>The resolution calling a peace convocation at Louisville, Kentucky, has been defeated in the Senate
of the Illinois Legislature.</p>
<p>The State Convention at Frankfort, Kentucky, at which delegates
from forty-five counties were present, has been broken up by the
military authorities, on the ground that the members, though calling
themselves Democrats, were Secessionists.</p>
<p>General Butler had been honoured with a public reception in
Baltimore.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER "RELIEF-SHIP" FROM AMERICA.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">ON</hi> the evening of Sunday week the American barque Achilles, under
the command of Captain Gallagher, arrived in the Mersey from
Philadelphia, with upwards of 5000 barrels of flour for the relief of
the distressed operatives in Lancashire. The Achilles having been
sighted off the port during the afternoon, the steam-tug Phoenix,
belonging to the New Steam-Tug Company (Limited), went out and met her
some distance outside the harbour. The Achilles was at once taken in
tow and brought into the river, and anchored between the Prince's
Landing Stage and Seacombe, in exactly the same position as that
occupied by the George Griswold when that vessel anchored in the
Mersey. The port pilotage and dock dues in this, as in the case of the
George Griswold, were remitted, and the New Steam-Tug Company towed up
the ship free of charge. On Monday morning, as soon as it became known
that the Achilles was in the river, immense numbers of people visited
the Prince's Landing Stage and the piers to have a look at the third
of the American relief-ships. The Achilles was easily distinguished by
the English ensign at the fore, her house-flag at the main, and the
national emblem of the United States at the mizen. At high water the
Achilles was taken in tow by the Phoenix, and docked in the Waterloo
Dock, where she will at once commence to discharge her cargo. There
are now three vessels in Liverpool that have brought relief from the
United States to the suffering poor in Lancashire--viz., The Hope,
George Griswold, and Achilles.</p>
<p>On Thursday week the Mayor of Liverpool (Mr. R. C. Gardner)
entertained the captains of the relief-ships to a grand banquet in the
Townhall. Amongst the gentlemen present were Sir William Brown, Bart.,
High Sheriff of Lancashire; the Mayor of Manchester, and Captain
Inglefield, R.N., C.B. The speeches were chiefly  expressive of the
gratitude felt by Lancashire for the noble donations of the people of
the Northern States, and hopes were expressed for a speedy termination
of the war and the further enlargement of the bonds of amity and good will
between the New and Old Worlds.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">SCIENTIFIC NEWS.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">AMERICAN COAL OIL.</hi>--In the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the
American Philosophical Society</hi> Mr. Heber R. Clark has given some
interesting geological information respecting some specimens of this
oil laid before the society. Some were of light colour; others thick
and black, like tar. The Edenburg Continental boring (in Lawrence
county, Pennsylvania) was sent down through 80 ft. of so-called drift;
then through 200 ft. of sandstones and shales, with a layer of black,
fetid shale at the bottom, from which the gas blew off violently; then
through 45 ft. or 50 ft. of the "first white sandstone, with gas in its
crevices (this sandrock is said to thin out eastward) ; then through
40 ft. or 50 ft. of shales and slates charged with gas and oil; then
through 75 ft. or 80 ft. of the second white sandstone"--softer,
coarser, and harder than the first, and full of gas--to the oil stratum,
448 ft. beneath the surface. The first sandrock has a soft middle
member between hard top and bottom members. Mr. Clark gave it as his
experience that the harder the rock was to drill the lighter in
colour, purer in quality, and smaller in quantity was the oil; the
softer the rock, the darker and more abundant the oil. At the Alban
well, 600 ft. deep, on Oil Creek, six miles above its mouth, Mr. Clark
saw the fresh oil spouting 100 ft. in the air a week after it had been
struck. At the Edenburg well, first described, Mr. Clark noticed that
for two or three weeks there occurred every day invariably, a few
minutes after eight o'clock p.m., a blow of gas violent enough to stop
the pump, and lasting from fifteen to thirty minutes, after which the
gas seemed to be exhausted. He thinks that there is more gas blown off
in winter than in summer, and that the testimony among the oil-well
men is general to that effect.</p></div2>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Savannah Republican</hi> says that three
steamers arrived at Charleston on the 9th ult. from Nassau. The
steamer Douglas ran out the same night. Not a shot was fired at any of
these vessels by the blockading squadron.</p>

<p>General Banks had been fired at by some unknown person in New
Orleans, while passing out of his hotel to his carriage. The ball did
not take effect. The affair occurred during the evening, and no trace
of the assailant could be found. Trouble continues to be experienced
in New Orleans concerning the coloured troops. Several white officers
have resigned, and one Brigadier-General has refused to march with the
negroes.</p>
<p>The Federal ram Queen of the West, which lately ran the line of
Confederate batteries on the Mississippi, has been captured by the
Confederates on the Red River, with the aid of a treacherous pilot,
who ran the vessel close to a Confederate battery. All the officers
and crew except thirteen escaped. She had six guns and a quantity of
stores on board.</p>

<p>Another bombardment of Vicksburg had taken place, without
result. The Federals now propose to reduce the place by a regular
siege. It is believed that there is much suffering in Vicksburg, on
account of the interruption of the river communication. Deserters
report that the Confederates would be compelled to evacuate the city
if relief did not shortly arrive.</p>

600,000,000 dols. for next year, in bonds payable in not less than ten
and not more than forty years in coin, and bearing six per cent
interest annually, payable in coin; also to issue 400,000,000 dols. in
three-year six per cent Treasury notes, the interest payable in lawful
money; also, to issue 150,000,000 dols. of legal-tender notes, to be
used solely for the liquidation of Treasury notes when required. The
bill also authorises a further issue of 50,000,000 dols. legal-tender
notes in addition to the issue of l00,000,000 dols. authorised in
January. The rate of taxation of the bank circulation is not

<p>The fallen condition of the institution of slavery in the State of
Maryland is evidenced by the following circumstance. The appraisers of
the slave property of the late Charles Carroll, one of the largest
slaveholders in Maryland, have made their returns to the Orphans'
Court, assessing the value of 130 slaves at an average of only 5
dols. each. This, they say, was the highest rate they could name after
consulting with numerous slaveholders and dealers. One slave-dealer
told the appraisers he would not give 500 dols. for the whole lot.</p>
<p>A collision has taken place between the inhabitants of Honey

<p>A battle took place on the 5th inst., between the Confederates
under Van Dorn and the Federals under general Coburn, at Springville,
Tennessee, thirteen miles south of Franklin. The fight lasted all day,
and ended in the defeat of the Federals. The Federal forces consisted
of three regiments of infantry, 500 cavalry, and one battery of
artillery. Nearly all the Federal infantry were cut to pieces or
captured, but the cavalry and artillery escaped.</p>
<p>The transactions at Vicksburg are shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>The Confederates have captured the Federal steamer Indianola 25
miles below Vicksburg. The rams Webb and Queen of the West attacked
her and charged into her until she surrendered. The fight lasted
several hours, and the Indianola surrendered in a sinking
condition.</p>
<p>The Confederate steamer Nashville ran aground at Fort Macallister,
Savannah and was destroyed by the Federal ironclads.</p>

<p>Senator Sumner reported to the Senate from the Committee upon
Foreign Relations concurrent resolutions regarding mediation, which
were afterwards passed by both houses of Congress. After referring to
the French offer of mediation, the resolutions declare that any idea
of mediation or intervention is impracticable, unreasonable, and
inadmissible; also that any offer of interference so far encourages
rebellion, and tends to prolong the contest; and that Congress will
therefore be obliged to regard any further attempt in the same
direction as an unfriendly act. The resolutions express regret that the
foreign Powers have not frankly informed the Southern chiefs that the
work in which they are engaged is hopeless, and that a new Government,
with slavery as its corner-stone, and with no other declared object of
separate existence, is so far shocking to civilisation and to the moral
sense of mankind that it must not expect welcome or recognition in the
commonwealth of nations.</p>
<p>The resolutions express an unalterable purpose to prosecute the war
until the rebellion is crushed. The resolutions will be communicated
to foreign Governments.</p>
<p>Both houses of Congress have passed a bill indemnifying the
President for the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus; also a bill
imposing a tax of two per cent upon bank circulation. The duty on paper
has been reduced from 50 to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Congress having expired at twelve o'clock on the 4th of March,
the Senate reassembled in extra Session, pursuant to the proclamation
of President Lincoln. Seventeen new members took their seats, of whom
nine were returned for the first time. 0f these nine six were

<p>An excited meeting of the New York Chamber of Commerce has taken
place. The meeting was called to discuss the burning of the Jacob
Bell. The president of the chamber intimated that a war with England
was a possibility, and one not to be dreaded. England's neutrality was
denounced, and the conduct of England towards American merchants
declared to be a disgrace to the age.</p>
<p>A riot has occurred at Detroit, Michigan, caused by an attempt of
the mob to take from the authorities and lynch a negro charged with
assaulting a white girl. The mob failed to capture the negro, but
attacked the coloured people miscellaneously. Fifteen persons are said
to be killed, and as many houses burned.</p>
<p>In consequence of the passage of the Act taxing speculative
transactions in gold and silver coin, there has been a sudden fall in
the premium on gold and silver, and the rate of sterling exchange. The
premium on gold was fluctuating between 150 and 155.</p></div2>

<p>The Alabama appears to be successfully pursuing her cruise for the
destruction of Federal merchantmen. The French ship Gil Blas, which
has arrived at Havre, has brought two French seamen belonging to the
Olive Jane, a Federal vessel bound from Bordeaux to New York, which
had been burned on the 21st ult. by Captain Semmes, together with a
very large ship bound from California to Queensland. The ship Gil Blas
parted from the Alabama on the 23rd ult. in latitude 31 deg. N. and
longitude 45 deg. W.; and on the same evening the light of a fire was
seen from the Gil Blas. The master of a Dutch ship which has arrived
at Rotterdam has likewise reported that he had seen two vessels on fire,
and that near one of them was a steamer answering the description of
the Alabama. One  of these two unlucky vessels, from some floating
books picked up by the Dutch captain appeared to be the Golden Eagle,
of New York.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">----</p>
<p>Those who are desirous of weighing fairly the merits of the
questions in dispute between the contending parties in America, as
well as to judge of the exact condition of the contest, are impeded by
the difficulty of getting at any accurate knowledge of what has
happened and is going on in the Southern States. Every one interested
in the matter, therefore, eagerly welcomes any contribution to the
slight acquaintance which we have possessed since the civil war began
of the Confederate districts. Thus, a new work just published by
Chapman and Hall, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Life in the South
from the Commencement of the War, by a Blockaded British Subject</hi>,
has all the benefit of a good introduction, as it purports to supply
an obvious want. Very meagre accounts, and very rough notes of things
down South, would be accepted without any regard being paid to special
literary fitness in their production; but, in the case of the book
before us, its acceptance will, we think, be without qualification. It
professes to be a social history of those who took part in the battles
of the internecine war from a personal acquaintance with them in their
own homes, which, being interpreted out of too literal a sense, means
that the author has had good opportunity of seeing and knowing
Southern men and manners, and becoming acquainted with traits of
character and domestic life. The writer seems to desire that the book
should be considered as a contribution to the social rather than the
political history of the revolution which has taken place; and, as it
is the production of a lady, the statement of such a design is
tactical with reference to the frame of mind to be induced in the
reader who takes it up. At the same time, as is very justly observed
by the author, it is impossible for even the softer sex not to be
something of politicians in America, where the business of committees
and conventions is brought home to every household and family; and
therefore, while recording what she herself saw and heard, politics
inevitably find a place; and there have been introduced into the
narrative extracts from the public papers of the South, few of which
have reached England since the commencement of the war. As regards the
treatment of that part of her subject which touches on the condition
of the slaves, the writer claims to have given an impartial account of
the "domestic institution", and therefore expresses a fear that
sometimes she may incur the imputation of upholding a system which is
repulsive to the opinion of England. All, however, she ventures to do
is to correct misrepresentations by statements of facts; and, without
at all deprecating the notion, and even indulging the hope, of the
ultimate extinction of slavery, she asserts that the most calamitous
and unmerciful infliction that could<sic> befal</sic> both master and servant
would be the sudden emancipation of the slaves of the Southern
States. Having thus stated, almost in the author's own words, the
scope and object of her work, it may be stated that she was tempted to
visit Virginia by a professional engagement--that is, she undertook
the duty of instructress to the daughters of the proprietor of an
estate in that State, not very distant from Fredericksburg. Although
the author gives no name on her titlepage, she signs her preface with
the initials S. L. J., and in the narrative calls herself Miss Jones;
and if that be not a <hi rend="italic">nom de guerre</hi>, we will
venture to say that by her work she has done much to illustrate that
somewhat commonplace name. It was shortly after the insurrection at
Harper's Ferry, in the autumn of 1859, that the author went South, her
route lying through Ohio, across the Alleghenies, by Washington, and
the River Rappahannock, now historical, to the little town of
Tappahannock, whence, her journey proper terminating, she was conveyed
to Forest Rill, the plantation of the gentleman into whose family she
was about to enter. In the very earliest chapters there are afforded
proofs of the author's capability of catching manners and
characteristics as they present themselves, and the descriptions of
the negro servants, her room and its furniture, the idiosyncrasies of
her pupils, the education of young American ladies of the South,
domestic habits and discipline, are happy and lifelike. It is only
with a shade less of vigour that she sketches the character of the
population and the more public and general features of the
country. Circumstances having caused Miss Jones--if we may call her
so--to leave Forest Rill, she took up her abode in Richmond, whence a
new engagement took her to another part of Virginia, soon after the
war began; and thenceforward the narrative, though mainly confined to
domestic occurrences, is interspersed with matter of which the
struggle between the Federals and Confederates is the subject. In the
course of these episodes there is an account given of a visit to one
of the Confederate camps, and the pass which she received is given
literally thus:--"Miss Sarah Jones has permission to visit the camp at
Yorktown, promising on her honour as a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> not
to communicate, either by word or writing, anything that may contribute
to the endangering of the Confederate States or to the aid and comfort
of the enemy."  Except the names and dates, the order was printed,
which accounts for the amusing collocation of the words "man" and Miss
Sarah. It is not within the province of this notice to go at any
length into the details of this work; and it is only intended to
indicate generally its nature and its peculiarities. Summing up its
merits as briefly as possible, it may be said that it is conceived
with sufficient comprehensiveness, but its chief feature is the power
of miniature-painting, so to speak, and the command of illustrating,
by minute but pungent examples, the life of the South in all its
varieties. There is a vein of humour, as especially to be
distinguished from the comic writing of the day, which runs through
the style and which renders it very agreeable. Some, indeed most, of
the anecdotes are pointed and interesting, and elucidate the story
which the author has to tell with singular felicity. As a whole the
book is remarkably full of matter, all of which is informatory, much
of it amusing, and none of it dull. There are no prosy disquisitions,
and even when the object is to argue and discuss a question the device
of animated conversation between persons, each speaking for himself,
is adopted, and with considerable success. In short, all who wish to
travel South--in print--will find Miss Sarah Jones a most agreeable
and a very able and well-informed companion.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">STATE RIGHTS AND FEDERAL</p>
<p rend="center">ASSUMPTIONS IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> great and fundamental doctrine of
State rights in America, derived originally from the Royal charters by
which the several colonies were established by the British Crown, was
felt by the founders of American Independence to be the only possible
basis upon which their Republican liberty could subsist. An immense
territorial empire or monarchy, extending over the greater part of the
continent, is possible, though undesirable; because its principle is
the concentration of power and authority in the hands of one strong,
skilful, and able individual, who becomes the head and chief of the
army, and, by means of the army, governs the people by exacting
obedience to his supreme will. But a great territorial republic, as
extensive as that of the United States in the time of Washington, if
popular liberty were to be assured within its limits, was only
possible by the decentralisation and diffusion of power, and by the
jealous supremacy of the several sovereign commonwealths, within their
original jurisdiction, in all matters of internal liberty. The idea
was that the first allegiance of an American was due to the State of
which he was a citizen; and so strongly was the idea rooted and
enforced, that to this moment no man is or can become a citizen of the
"United States." The native of Massachusetts is a citizen of
Massachusetts, and not of the United States; and the foreigner or
immigrant who settles in the country must choose his State, and
qualify himself by residence in it, before he can take out letters of
naturalisation. It takes five years to make him a citizen of New York;
but he can acquire the privilege in six months in some of the rising
States of the West, that are too urgently in want of people to till
the land and drive off the marauding Indians to afford to be
particular. A league of commonwealths, each governing itself, but
united for purposes of defence against foreigners, and especially
against England, who was thought to be capable of reannexing her
rebellious colonies if they did not adhere closely together to resist
her aggression, was the scheme of American liberty and independence
that recommended itself to the judgment of the great men of the
Washingtonian era. By that scheme each State had its own constitution,
its own legislature, its own executive chief magistrate, and its own
militia; and the Federal or Central Government--kept within the limits
of the Constitution by the Judiciary of the Supreme Court--had but a
shadow of power, except in its relations to the outer
world. Externally the Union was everything--internally it was
nothing. So long as this idea was rigidly acted upon, the American
Republics, with their nominal and scarcely felt central government,
were free, prosperous, and happy. In proportion to the increase of the
number of the States, and the extension of the Union backwards from
the Atlantic seaboard towards the Pacific, ought to have been the
jealousy entertained of any attempt at the centralisation of
power. The States, as States, were entirely free. The only liberty
denied them by the voluntary compact into which they entered was the
liberty to make war upon each other, or to subvert, or endeavour to
subvert, by external agencies, their separate Constitutions. To all
other intents and purposes each State was free to shape its laws
according to the social wants, necessities, observances, and
prejudices of its people. Massachusetts and New York were free to
abolish negro slavery<pb n="342"/> within their boundaries; South
Carolina and Georgia were free to retain it. At a later period the
commonwealths of Indiana and Illinois were free to prevent the ingress
or settlement of any coloured people within their lines. In no sense
whatever were these States to be considered provinces of an empire or
subdivisions of a unity, such as the English counties and French
departments at the present day. In England the law of Northumberland
is the law of Devonshire; but in America the law of Maine is not the
law of Pennsylvania, nor the law of Pennsylvania the law of New York
or New Jersey. If the States had continued to respect in each other
their solemnly secured rights, it is highly probable that the whole
continent of North America would have been in due time covered with a
congeries of free and happy Republics, and that Canada and the British
colonies in the north, and Mexico and the Isthmian territories in the
south, would have, one by one, asked to form part of the American
Union, and been formally admitted to the enjoyment of the
privilege. This would, indeed, have been a noble Government. Had it
been perpetuated, negro slavery would have gradually died out, because
it would have proved unprofitable as well as wrong. War would have
been at an end, except against any European Power that assumed the
aggressive, which it would not have done against so stupendous a
resistance as America would have offered. The principle of
self-government would have been triumphantly asserted; and the
American commonwealths would have presented to the world a sublimer
spectacle than history has ever yet recorded--the spectacle of a free,
untaxed, highly civilised, and progressive people, working out, under
the most favourable circumstances, and with the widest facilities for
growth and development, the fortunes of the race, and solving happily
the great problem of the destinies of humanity.</p>

<p>But this was not to be. The third generation after Washington
misunderstood and perverted the fundamental doctrine of Republican
freedom. New men, with new ideas, came upon the scene. The scum, the
dregs, the refuse, and the rascality of Europe--everybody who had lost
or could not obtain a chance in the Old World--flocked into the New;
and, knowing nothing of the delicate machinery by which the slender
fabric of the Federal power was upheld, they set to work to destroy
it. The civil war now raging shows with what success they
laboured. They did not bring into the New World with them any
knowledge of the checks and counter-checks, the nice balances and fine
adjustments of the most complicated Constitution ever adopted by a
civilised people; and they ignorantly interfered with its working,
till the machine split with a noise that has startled the world. They
were aided by the New England Puritans and Educationalists, whose
ideas were mainly derived from European literature at a time when
America had no literature of its own; and, as this class looked much
more fondly to the realisation of their dream of being a great and
dominant rather than a free and happy people, they strengthened the
Federal power whenever they had the opportunity, and weakened the
State power, which was the best guarantee of their own liberties. The
manufacturing interest in New England and Pennsylvania, with a view
ostensibly to the development of national industry, but really with
the design of their own enrichment, agitated the question of a
protective tariff, by which they might compel the agricultural people
of the South and West to buy native goods at double, and often treble,
the price at which a better class of fabrics could have been imported
from England. This was one of the first of the many predisposing
causes of disunion which were introduced and fostered by those who
wished to make America one nation instead of a partnership of
nations. In due time, after the emancipation by Great Britain of the
slaves in the West India Islands, the attempt was made to elevate
negro slavery in America into the dignity and importance of a national
instead of a sectional question. For nearly thirty years the question
was agitated, but mostly by the European and Puritanic elements of
American society--the sole results being, first to exasperate the
Southern States against the busybodies of the North, who would not
confine themselves to their own business; and, secondly, to strengthen
the South in its determination, not only to uphold and maintain, but
to justify, the institution. And all this was done in the false
assumption that the Union was a nation, and that the Federal
Government had both the right and the power to interfere with the
State constitutions whenever it thought it just and
expedient. Questions of free trade and tariff, extension of territory,
and the abolition of slavery, were but the different phases assumed
from time to time by the one great and paramount question of the
Federal against the State authority. The clearest-headed and most
patriotic men of America foresaw the inevitable result, and deprecated
the encroachment with all the energy they could command. As the North
increased in population more rapidly than the South, in consequence of
the influx not only of ignorant but of unprincipled and reckless
foreigners from Europe, and the South held out the more tenaciously to
State rights the more vehemently they were attacked, the conviction
forced itself upon the minds of all its leading men that the
disruption of the Union was only a question of time. They did not wish
to expedite it; nor, could they have ruled the country on the doctrine
of State Rights, as enforced by the decisions of the Supreme Court,
would they ever have thought of breaking up the nominal Union, under
which all the States had so marvelously prospered. But they were too
constantly goaded on the slavery question, and too constantly taxed in
all articles of foreign produce by the operation of a protectional
tariff, exclusively beneficial to Northern manufacturers, to be
otherwise than dissatisfied with the partnership to which they seemed
to be doomed. The North refused to take warning. Strong in theory, it
despised fact. It required justice to the negro, even though the white
race should be ruined, and the black along with it. Ultimately, as all
the world knows, the Southern people took the remedy into their own
hands by secession, and were willing to forfeit many solid advantages
derived from the Union, in order that they might be free from the
constant interference of the North with their system of labour. They
could not abolish slavery, even if they wished to do so; for four
millions of slaves could not be suddenly set free without danger to
themselves as well as ruin to their masters; and when they knew that
the agitation in the negro's favour was got up in Massachusetts and
other New England States, in the midst of communities that treated the
negro as a social pariah, they hurled against the North the imputation
of hypocrisy as well as illegality, and declined to have further
partnership with it.</p>

<p>The North has misunderstood liberty and the principles of its own
Government through the whole course of these unhappy disputes and the
horrible war that has grown out of them. It was itself free from the
guilt of slavery, and that ought to have been enough. Attempting
coercion by the sword, it has attempted what was beyond its right and
its province, and has suffered accordingly. Those who take to the
sword perish by the sword. And, under the operation of so-called
military necessities, it has lost its own liberties without doing the
smallest particle of good to the black men whom it attempted to free,
or removing a single obstacle that blocks the way to universal
emancipation.</p>

<p>Twenty millions of white Northern men exist under a Despotism; and
four millions of black Southern men remain just what and where they
were before the war commenced. And all this has happened, because the
Northern Americans wanted to be a nation when they were not a nation;
and attacked that principle of State sovereignty and local
self-government which was the only possible basis on which their
Republican form of government could subsist. But they were a proud
people, and needed to be taught a lesson of humility. They are
receiving it at this moment, and all the world looks on with sympathy
and wonder.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>From the army on the Rappahannock there is nothing to report
beyond a successful cavalry raid on the part of the Confederates into
Fairfax Courthouse, resulting in the capture of Brigadier-General
Stoughton, with his head-quarters, guard, and fifty-five horses.</p>

<p>No attack on Charleston had yet been made; but General Hunter had
issued preliminary orders, showing that an attack would
soon commence. General Beauregard, in anticipation thereof, has
revoked all furloughs and recalled all absentees to Charleston.</p>
<p>Partly in order to test the invulnerability of the Federal
ironclads, they bombarded Fort M'Allister, in the Ogeechee River, for
twenty hours. They were struck several times, but not injured. They
could not get near enough to the fort to dismantle it on account of
the obstructions in the river.</p>

<p>Federal gun-boats have passed through the channel cut by the army
from the Mississippi into Lake Providence, in the northern parish of
Louisiana. They have done considerable damage on its banks.</p>
<p>Mr. Slidell's property has been confiscated at New Orleans.</p>
<p>It is reported from Memphis that the Federal expedition up the
Yazoo has captured Yazoo city and all the Confederate transports above
it.</p>
<p>Immense numbers of the Federal troops are sick at Vicksburg.</p>

<p>President Lincoln has issued a proclamation declaring that absent
soldiers who return to their commands before the 1st of April will be
reinstated; but that those who do not do so will be arrested and
treated as deserters. He warns the people against enticing soldiers to
desert, and calls upon them to assist in preventing desertion.</p>

<p>The British steamer Peterhoff, from London, for the Mexican port of
Metamoras, was captured off St. Thomas by a vessel of Admiral Wickes's
squadron and sent into Key West for adjudication. She was heavily
laden with boots, blankets, &#x0026;c., for the Confederate
Government.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>Richmond despatches speak discouragingly of the prospect of
supplies of food, and say that the impressment of grain by the
Government discourages production. The New York journals assert that
gold at Richmond is at 350 per cent premium.</p>

<p>The Mobile papers state that the Confederates have much trouble
with the Union men in Northern Alabama. One county is said to be full
of them, and many deserters are joining them.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The Senate has confirmed the appointment of Mr. Cassius M. Clay as
Minister to Russia. His confirmation was specially pressed by
Mr. Seward and the President.</p>
<p>The Senate adjourned on the 14th.</p>
<p>Senator Sumner, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,
strongly urged the President not to issue letters of marque. On the
other hand, the committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce have had
an interview with President Lincoln, urging him to issue them
forthwith.</p>

<p>The election in New Hampshire is rather favourable to the
Republicans. Two Republican and one Democratic member have been
elected to Congress. There were three candidates for Governor,
and none claimed an absolute majority. The Republican candidate will
be chosen by the Legislature.</p>

<p>The British steamer Queen of the Wave has run ashore at
Charleston. The Federal Admiral Dupont was making efforts to save
her.</p>
<p>The Federal debt, up to March 1, 1863, is set down at 868,000,000
dols.</p>
<p>Secretary Chase is in New York, endeavouring to raise 100,000,000
dols., one half in twenty-year bonds and the other half in short
bonds. It was reported in Wall-street that he had received<pb n="343"/> an offer
from Europe for 100,000,000 dols. six per cent bonds at a higher
figure than par. Gold was at 58 premium.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Utah.</hi></p>

<p>A collision between the military and the citizens if Utah has taken
place. Congress having passed a law to put down polygamy, the Governor
of Utah and his associate justices ordered the military to arrest
Brigham Young and Councillors Kimball and Wells. The citizens armed,
but were not able to prevent the arrest of their high priest. He was
released on giving bonds to appear for trial.</p></div2>

interfere for the purpose of putting an end to the desolating civil
war in America if they could do so justly and usefully; but he felt
persuaded that at the present moment any such step on their part would
be productive of no advantage and would be attended with very
unfortunate results. If they were to offer their mediation to the
Government of the United States that offer would be unhesitatingly
declined, and would create in the minds of the people of that country
a considerable amount of irritation; and if they were formally to
recognise the Southern States such an act would be justly regarded as
one of a very unfriendly character towards a Government with which
this country had hitherto preserved amicable relations. Our duty
therefore was to maintain, under existing circumstances, our perfectly
neutral position, whatever might be our conviction that the spirit of
the South was unconquerable and that the disruption of the American
Union was final and irrevocable.--No further discussion ensued.</p>

<p>The main fighting during the week under review has been in the<pb n="367"/> neighbourhood of Port Hudson. We have as yet received only
the Confederate accounts. According to them the bombardment of Port
Hudson commenced at two o'clock on the 14th ult. At twelve o'clock
p.m. the Federals attempted to pass the batteries under cover of the
darkness. One gun-boat passed in a damaged condition. The Federal
sloop-of-war Mississippi was burnt to the water's edge in front of the
batteries. One large vessel was completely riddled, a third badly
crippled, and the rest driven back. Thirty-six of the crew of the
Mississippi were captured. Admiral Farragut's flag-ship went down the
river disabled.</p>
<p>On the Yazoo River the Federal gun-boats captured twenty-six
gun-boats, destroying eighteen of them.</p>
<p>The works on the Vicksburg Canal had come to naught. The
Mississippi broke through the lev&#xE9;e and filled the trench with
water and rubbish, thus rendering it useless.</p>
<p>The inundations in Mississippi and Louisiana caused by the cutting
of the lev&#xE9;es at Yazoo Pass and Lake Providence covered a great
extent of country. In Louisiana a region covering 5000 square miles
has been converted into a lake.</p>
<p>The Confederates have fortified the approaches to Galveston, Texas,
with the guns captured from the Federal steamers Harriet Lane and
Westfield. Three batteries are erected on the island where the city
is planted, and Pelican Island is fortified with equal strength. The
Federal fleet off Galveston consists of the steam-frigate Brooklyn and
four gun-boats. The fleet approaches to within a mile and a half of
the town, where the vessels anchor and occasionally throw shells into
the town and forts; but they cannot bring their broadsides to bear,
and have to operate exclusively with their rifled pivot-guns. The
Brooklyn's fire set the town in flames at three different places, but
the danger was soon subdued. The Brooklyn was compelled to withdraw as
the forts began to send shot from their 15-inch rifled guns, one of
which cut the rigging. The Harriet Lane is up the river some seventy
miles, where she is being iron-clad.</p>
<p>The steamers Britannia, Gertrude, and Havelock have arrived safely
at Confederate ports.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has definitively refused to authorise the issue
of letters of marque.</p>

<p>The Legislature of New Jersey has passed a series of peace
resolutions by a vote in the Assembly of 38 against 13. These
resolutions protest against war waged for unconstitutional or partisan
purposes, or for the subjugation of States with a view to their
reduction to a territorial condition; against the domination of
military law over civil law in States not in insurrection; against
arbitrary arrests and the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act; against
the admission of Western Virginia; against the emancipation
proclamation and the expenditure of public money for the benefit of
the negro race. The legislature believes that the appointment of
Federal commissioners to meet commissioners from the insurgent States
to consider if any plan may be adopted, consistent with the honour and
dignity of the national Government, by which the present civil war may
be brought to a close, is not inconsistent with the honour and dignity
of the Federal Government, but, as an indication of the spirit which
animates the adhering States would, in any event, tend to strengthen
America in the opinion of other nations. The resolutions will be
forwarded to the Federal Government and to the Governors and
Legislatures of the other States, requesting them to give the subject
immediate attention.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ice Bridge At Niagara.</hi>--For the third time
in the history of Canada the Niagara River at its junction with Lake
Ontario has been bridged with ice. The first occasion was before the
war of 1812; the second in the spring of 1845. In the latter instance
the river, with the exception of very rare and insignificant spots,
was bridged over from its mouth to within a short distance of the
Falls, and at the wharf at Niagara the boulders of ice were packed on
the top of each other to the height of forty or fifty feet, completely
shutting out the view of the opposite shore. The third bridging of the
river commenced at two o'clock on Monday afternoon, Feb. 16, and at
four o'clock some persons crossed. On Tuesday morning a party of
seventeen or eighteen, half of whom were ladies, came over from
Youngstown to Niagara. The river is bridged with ice from its mouth
upwards for a distance of about two miles and a half. The sight is
reported as being one of surpassing beauty and grandeur, and well
worth a journey to see. The cause of the "jam" is a prevalence of
south winds for a few days, and then a sudden change to the north--the
first forcing the ice down the Upper Lakes into the river, which is
prevented by the north-winds from getting into Lake Ontario.-<hi rend="italic">St. Catherine's Journal.</hi></p></div2>

<p>Admiral Porter, commander of the Federal Upper Mississippi
squadron, describes a singular trick he recently played the
Confederates. Writing to a friend in New York, he says:--"During the
time of the running the blockade by the Queen of the West and the
Indianola, five of the guns in the forts at Vicksburg burst and were
dismounted; therefore it was an object to make the enemy fire as much
as possible. Finding that they could not be provoked to fire without
an object, I thought of getting up an imitation Monitor. Ericsson
saved the country with an iron one--why could I not save it with a
wooden one? An old coal barge, picked up in the river, was the
foundation to build on. It was built of old boards in twelve hours,
with pork barrels on the top of each other for smokestacks, and two
old canoes for quarter-boats; her furnaces were built of mud, and only
intended to make black smoke and not steam. Without knowing that Brown
was in peril, I let loose our Monitor. When it was descried by the
light of the morn, never did the batteries of Vicksburg open with such
a din; the earth fairly trembled, and the shot flew thick around the
devoted Monitor. But she ran safely past all the batteries, though
under fire for an hour, and drifted down to the lower mouth of the
canal. She was a much better-looking vessel than the Indianola. When
it was broad daylight they opened on her again with all the guns they
could bring to bear, without a shot hitting her to do any harm,
because they did not make her settle in the water, though going in at
one side and out at another. She was already full of water. The
soldiers of our Army shouted and laughed like mad."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">However</hi> difficult the North has found it
to make any decided impression upon the territory or spirit of the
seceded States of America, it has succeeded, with its great resources,
in isolating the South from all but the sympathy of Europe. From this
we, in common with many others, have suffered not a little. The
gentleman who has for some time past acted as our Special Artist and
Correspondent in the Southern States of America finds the greatest
difficulty in sending us the results of his labours. Our readers will
no doubt remember that a short while back an English officer was
arrested while running the blockade, and that the possession of
correspondence addressed to us was held, amongst other causes,
sufficient to warrant his detention and imprisonment. Upon that
occasion the sketches found in his possession were forwarded not to
us, but to the managers of <hi rend="italic">Harper's Weekly</hi>, in
New York, in the columns of which paper they in due time appeared,
with a na&#xEF;ve acknowledgment that they were from the pencil of
Mr. Vizetelly.</p>

<p>But the large proportion of the Sketches intercepted on their way
from the South are doomed never to see the light of day. "What," asks
our Correspondent, in the last letter received from him, "has become of
Jackson's head-quarters, Lee's head-quarters, Stuart's head-quarters,
encampment of the Confederates on the Shenandoah, view of Winchester,
and many others? Where are all my letters from the Rappahannock and
Richmond, one only of which is inserted, and which has been quoted in
all the Southern papers?" Our readers may learn from the above that
the long intervals which frequently elapse between our news and
engravings of the progress of the war in the Southern States of
America arise from no lack of spirit or industry on the part of our
Special Artist, but from the impenetrability of the cordon which the
North has succeeded in drawing around the seceded provinces. In
reference to this subject--the difficulty, namely, of holding postal
communication with England--Mr.<pb n="373"/> Vizetelly mentions the
fact that the <hi rend="italic">Times'</hi> correspondent is said to
pay 100 dols. in gold to every messenger who attempts to run the
blockade with his letters from the Southern camp to Baltimore, and
that they are frequently lost by his emissaries being captured on the
Potomac.</p>

<p>At the date of our Correspondent's letter (Feb. 2), Charleston was
preparing itself for greater efforts on the part of its enemy than
have yet been made against it. "This morning," he writes, "the
Ironsides, the largest of the Yankee armour-vessels, has appeared off
here; others are reported on their way; and we hear that a last effort
is to be made to capture Charleston, the head and front of
Secession. All the women and children are preparing to move, and,
should the attack be made, I am convinced that the Federals will be
beaten off."</p>

<p>Two of our Engravings illustrate the threatened fortifications,
harbour, and town of Charleston. Both are taken from the same
spot--viz., from Fort Johnson, but one is taken from a point looking
seaward, the other up the harbour. When the Confederates bombarded
Fort Sumter at the commencement of the war, Forts Johnson and Moultrie
were the points from which they made the attack. "Now all these
batteries combined, and many others that have been added have been
improved and strengthened to such an extent that it seems," writes
Mr. Vizetelly, "impossible that anything can enter the harbour." "I
have not," he adds, "drawn all the defences, because I am bound in
honour not to divulge them. They will, however, be discovered by the
Federal ships whenever they attempt to force a passage."</p>

<p>Our third Engraving illustrates one of the most gallant and
courageous deeds of the Southern navy. "For months," writes
Mr. Vizetelly, "the people of Charleston have been busily engaged
constructing two iron-clad gun-boats on the same plan as the old
Merrimac, and within the last few weeks they were completed, and only
waited an opportunity to measure their strength with the enemy's fleet
blockading the port. This opportunity was given them on tho 30th of
January.<pb n="374"/> It was a still, calm night; there was not even a
ground-swell on the bar, and everything appeared favourable for the
daring attempt. Hearing it was Commodore Ingraham's intention to move
out, I made arrangements to accompany this squadron of two vessels
that was going to engage the fleet of thirteen ships of war, that was
reported to he off Fort Sumter at sundown. The tide did not serve to
cross the bar until four a.m. on the 31st, and from eleven o'clock at
night when they got under way till half-past three the ironclads
cruised solemnly about in the misty moonlight, waiting that hour which
was fated to be the last of many of the foe. At length the lead gave
water enough to cross the bar, and grandly and silently the Palmetto
State and the Chicora advanced into the gloom beyond. In thirty
minutes from the time of crossing the bar the Palmetto State came open
the first of the blockaders, the Mercedita, of 11 guns, looming large
and undefined upon the unruffled sea. Painted a lead colour, the
Confederate could hardly be seen at a greater distance than a hundred
yards; and it was not till they were close upon each other that the
watch on board the Federal ship hailed the stranger. In another minute
the prow of the Palmetto State was buried deep in the Mercedita's
timbers, and at the same moment the heavy, rifled gun mounted forward
on the former was fired right into the shattered ship, and ere the
smoke had blown away she careened over and commenced settling. A
Lieutenant and boat's crew put off in confusion from the sinking
vessel, and begged of Commodore Ingraham to cease firing, telling him
that the water was already up to the berth-deck, and that they
surrendered. The Commodore then hauled off, unable to take any of the
Federals on his own ship, there only being room for his crew to fight
the guns; so, paroling those alongside him, he desired them to make
every exertion to save the ship's company in the boats. It is feared,
however, they all perished, as the Mercedita suddenly disappeared. In
the meantime, the Chicora stood well out and encountered three of the
blockaders together. She engaged the one nearest to her and set her on
fire. She also disappeared suddenly in the gloom, and, it is believed,
went down. Another then attracted her attention, and after a
half-dozen shots from a heavy rifled gun at close quarters, a large
escapement of steam was perceived, the fire-bell rung on board of her,
and she hauled down her colours, though, in the most cowardly manner,
she afterwards escaped in the confusion with one wheel alone turning,
and almost on her beam-ends. All the blockaders had by this time got a
full head of steam on them, and they made off at speed to the
south-east, leaving the two little iron-clads masters of the field,
the latter sending shot and shell after them so long as they were
within range. At daylight not a Federal vessel was in sight, and five
only of them appeared in the evening after the Palmetto State and
Chicora had recrossed the bar. The armament of both these gun-boats is
two broadside, 8-in. smoothbores, one on each side, and a pivot,
7-in. rifle at the bow and stern, made to work also out of the
starboard and port ports fore and aft."</p></div2>

<p>ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY.--General Rosencranz, in his report of the
battle of Murfreesboro', estimates that out of 20,000 cannon-shots
fired by the Federals, 728 hit the enemy; and that, out of 2,000,000
musket-shots, 13,832 told. The result of this valuation is that it
required 27 cannon-shots or 155 musket-balls to hit one man. Each ball
weighing one mean ounce, 9 lb. of metal would be used to kill a man with musketry; and with artillery,
225 lb. of metal would be required for the same purpose; the deaths
being in the proportion of 1 to 4 relative to the wounded, 36 lb. of
balls, or 900 lb. of iron, would be employed in killing one
man.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">SKETCHES IN PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p>...On the Friday evening on which the House adjourned for the Easter
recess there was placed on the paper as much notice of business as
would have legitimately occupied a fortnight; but as it is impossible
to get schoolboys to learn lessons the day before their holidays
commence, so with members; they flutter and fidget, and show no
disposition to assemble in numbers or to sit late. Nevertheless,
Mr. W. E. Forster did contrive to elicit a smartish debate on the
subject of the Alabama, Confederate ship of war, and her doings, which
are supposed to infringe great principles of international
law. Careful, moderate in expression, but decided in opinion,
Mr. Forster made exactly the sort of speech which the occasion
required. His tactical mode of dealing with the question was fully
justified by the touchiness of the Opposition, who seized every
opportunity of showing which way their sympathy lay; and, being
present at the time in larger numbers then those who espoused
Mr. Forster's views, if he had goaded them to it, they might have got
up a demonstration in the House of Commons the very opposite to that
which he desired to create. Unquestionably Mr. Bright felt something
of this when, in replying to the astute and masterly-put arguments of
the Solicitor-General, he burst through the trammels of a fearful
cold, which almost deprived him of his voice, and uttered an appeal,
half plaintive, half passionate, to Lord Palmerston, to use his
acknowledged influence to prevent its going forth that the majority of
the House sympathised rather with the Confederate than with the
Federal cause. It sounded like a wail of despair when he implored the
avoidance of such an issue to a debate which was intended to be, if
anything, a pronouncement in favour of individual as well as national
abstinence from assistance to the South, with a reservation in favour
of all sorts of aid and comfort to the North. At least so Mr. Laird
put it; and went far, statistically, to prove it in his curiously
damaging speech. What was distinctly proved is, that to the British
trader the true way to carry out the doctrine of neutrality is to
accept customers from all markets. Did not the Kaffirs in the Cape
wars shoot the British soldiers with excellent muskets from
Birmingham?</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the steamers Edinburg and Norwegian we have
telegrams from New York to the evening of the 27th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>There in nothing new from the Rappahannock, except the rumour that
General Lee intends falling back upon Richmond.</p>
<p>From Port Royal it is reported that a fleet of seven ironclads left
that place on the 22nd ult. Their supposed destination is
Charleston.</p>
<p>The negro expedition from Port Royal to Florida had captured
Jacksonville, in that State, after routing a body of Confederate
cavalry.</p>
<p>The truth concerning the engagement at Port Hudson establishes
itself but slowly. It is admitted on both sides that the Federal
steamer Mississippi was lost, and that two steamers passed the
batteries. These were the Hartford, Admiral Farragut's flagship, and
the Monongahela, which have arrived safely at Vicksburg. General Banks
failed to make a land attack, and fell back upon his fortified
camp. Northern accounts state that Admiral Farragut's vessels
recaptured the steamer Indianola without resistance. The Hartford
anchored off Natchez on the 16th, and the Admiral informed the
authorities that if the Federal vessels were fired upon he would
bombard the city. Admiral Farragut left the following morning.</p>

<p>The water has been let into the canal at Lake Providence. The
aperture is 20 ft. wide, and is still widening. The water is pouring
in with great force, and the greater part of the town of Lake
Providence was submerged.</p>
<p>At Vicksburg the Confederates are said to be living almost
exclusively on corn meal. The river is falling, and the fears
entertained of an overflow of the Federal camping-ground have
subsided. A coalbarge, with 1000 bushels of coal, had been floated past
Vicksburg batteries for the use of Farragut's vessels.</p>
<p>The<hi rend="italic"> Memphis Bulletin</hi> asserts that three of
Admiral Porter's gun-boats have reached Yazoo River through Sunflower
River and arrived at Greenwood. The Federals at Greenwood had
abandoned the attempt to pass Fort Pemberton, at the junction of the
Yallabusha and Tallahatchie Rivers, and were returning to Yazoo
Pass. It is supposed that Admiral Porter's arrival would stimulate
them to renew the attack.</p>
<p>The privateer Florida coaled at Barbados on the 23rd ult., and her
captain dined with the Governor. Admiral Wilkes subsequently refused
an invitation to dine with the Governor.</p>
<p>The steamer Aries and another vessel were at St. Thomas on the l6th
inst. Admiral Wilkes threatened to seize those vessels if they left
port, on the charge that they were blockade-runners. The captain of
the Aries applied to the British steamer Phaeton for protection, which
was granted. The Vanderbilt then sailed out of port, and the other
vessel was conveyed out by the Phaeton.</p>
<p>The British steamer Georgiana has been driven ashore on Long
Island, South Carolina, in an attempt to run the blockade of
Charleston. She had a large cargo of dry goods, medicines, and
artillery, valued at 1,000,000 dols. She was scuttled by the captain
to prevent her capture, and was afterwards shelled and destroyed by
the Federals. The British steamer Nicholas has been captured while
endeavouring to run the blockade at Wilmington, North Carolina. She
previously made an effort to enter Charleston. The British steamer
Peterhoff, bound for the Mexican port of Matamoras, and captured by
Admiral Wilkes, has been taken from Key West to New York for
adjudication.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Western Virginia.</hi></p>

<p>The new State Constitution of Western Virginia has been ratified by
the vote of the people. The Constitution provides that the children of
slaves born after July next shall be free. All slaves under ten years
of age shall be free when they reach twenty-one years. All slaves over
ten and under twenty-one shall be free at twenty-five years of age. No
fugitive slaves will be permitted to come into the State to settle
there. These provisions are, in point of fact, only applicable to
about l0,000 slaves.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>

<p>The New Jersey Assembly, by a vote of 33 to 10, has passed an Act
for the imprisonment and transportation of every free negro who shall
hereafter come into the State and remain ten days.</p>
<p>Major-General Edwin V. Sumner died at Syracuse, New York, on the
21st ult. He was one of the oldest Generals in the army, having been
in the service over forty-three years. His last words were, "God save
my country, the United States of America."</p>
<p>A committee for the relief of the distress of the poor in the North
and West of Ireland has been formed in New York, and has collected
already a sum of several thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Considerable movements and many strikes are taking place among the
working men of New York for higher wages. A large meeting has been
held and resolutions passed to organise a league of all trades for the
better security of the rights of labour. The speakers complained of
the rise of the prices of food, clothing, and rent, and declared their
intention to resist the encroachments of capital.</p>
<p>It is reported that Secretary Chase will not put a loan on the
market for some time. The Government is said to be receiving daily,
from different sources, nearly 2&#xBD; million dollars, which amount
covers the daily expenses of the war. The sale of Five-dollar
Twenty-cent Bonds continues to increase; and the demand for these
bonds, on foreign account, is stated to be large. Gold continues to
fall. It is now at 4l&#xBD; premium.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">California.</hi></p>

<p>It was believed the project to establish a British line of steamers
between California and China would be abandoned.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Arrival of a A Flag Of Truce On
Confederate Territory.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Engraving represents one of the many
curious and interesting episodes of the Civil War in America--the arrival of a steamer with a
flag of truce in Dixie's Land. Happily, it is of a lighter and less
tragic character than the majority of the Illustrations which have
appeared in our columns. The scene of the incident which we have
illustrated is the village of Madisonville, lying upon a little river
bearing the Indian name of Chefunctee, on the northern shore of
<sic>Portchartrain</sic>. This coast remains in the undisputed possession of the
Confederates, while the Federals occupy the southern side. The
steam-boat, one of the high-pressure kind so commonly in use on the
Mississippi, and connected in our minds with thoughts of boiler
explosions and snag impalements, has just landed a crowd of women and
children, "registered enemies" of the United States, and who have been
conveyed at their own request to the rebels--their husbands, friends,
and relatives.</p></div2>

1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> we do not "drift" into trouble with the
Federal States it will not be the fault of noisy speakers and
intemperate writers. These individuals are assuredly doing their best
to assist in what Lord Palmerston described as the manufacture of
American political capital at the expense of England. Of this process,
as carried on in Washington and New York, we have, perhaps, no great
right to complain, and England has never shown herself harsh in her
judgment of the acts of a nation struggling with unexampled
difficulty, debt, and disaster. But we must protest, and that
emphatically, against the attempt of the American organs here to break
the neutrality which has been proclaimed from the Throne, and which
has been recognised by all the temperate and respectable part of the
nation. This attempt has been postponed until the reverses met by the
Federals, and the solemn declaration of the South that nothing shall
re-unite it with the North, have exasperated the Union organs beyond
all bounds, and it is therefore shown to be a sort of desperate
resource, akin to that by which Mr. Lincoln, after showing every
willingness to coalesce with the slaveowners, proclaimed freedom to
the slaves of "rebels" while retaining the others in
bondage. Principle has nothing to do with the matter, and the effort
to alter British policy is merely an expedient of war.</p>
<p>This will not do. England has determined not to be dragged into the
American struggle if she can possibly avoid it; and the resolve of a
nation ought not to be affected by the scribblings of fanatics or the
nonsense of hireling orators. Nor will it be. The agitators against
neutrality are the most insignificant persons who ever tried to shout
themselves into notoriety. The names of the speakers at the meetings
in aid of Mr. Seward are names which, in ordinary times, cause a man
instinctively to pass on from the report to some other part of the
paper. They have an influence like that of the headings of the
advertisements which seek to enlist attention by some paradox to which
the puff is clumsily appended. The country laughs at such
demonstrations. But, for all that, they may become excessively
mischievous by their operation in America. Readers there are
proverbially ignorant of the relative value and power of our public
men. The New Yorker who is told in his own paper that Exeter Hall or
St. James's Hall has been crowded with sympathisers, and that fiery
addresses have been delivered to them amid storms of approbation,
thinks that all this means something, and has an influence in the
national councils. He does not know, and could scarcely comprehend the
facts if laid before him, that a gathering of thirty or forty of our
statesmen in a quiet room in Piccadilly or St James's-square would
have more to do with directing the policy of the Legislature than the
largest crowd that ever assembled to cheer Blondin, George Thompson,
or Tom Thumb. The American does not understand the secrets of English
public life, the formation of public opinion here, and the certificate
of character implied in the position of a leading politician. The New
Yorker cannot see why an Edwin James has to emigrate, while a Roundell
Palmer is called upon to advise the Crown on international law. Hence
these mob-meetings, and the angry and vindictive talk which impudently
claims to be the utterance of the people, and is nothing of the kind,
will produce--nay, we believe, are producing--upon the American mind a
very evil influence. It will be believed in the North that the
Government of England and the people of England are not as one in the
matter of neutrality, and the inference will be that, if the North
menaces us with war, the people will drive Lord Palmerston from office
and reverse his policy. The idea is so ridiculous to us, of course,
that there is danger of our refusing to believe that it can be
entertained in the North, and only those who are really aware of the
helpless ignorance of the American people (in spite of their high
education at the hands of the newspapers) upon the real feelings of
Englishmen, can entirely appreciate the importance of the
consideration in question. We can assure our readers, however, that
very few statements discreditable to England would fail of obtaining
belief in America, and that none at all would be rejected by the
directors of a large portion of the American press as too outrageous
to form texts for fresh abuse of this country. It is painful to have
to say this; but it is better to bear any such pain than to permit
mischief to go on which may cause quarrel and bloodshedding.</p>
<p>The Federals, having shown that they either cannot build vessels
which are swift enough to catch the Confederate cruisers, or cannot
spare for that service officers of sufficient skill and spirit to run
down these privateers (and there is no lack of brave and able officers
in the gallant navy of the North), content themselves with abusing
England because some of the Southern vessels have been built--where
the North may build equally good ships if it likes--namely, in British
dockyards. The law of England, both domestic and international, is
perfectly clear, and the proceedings which it is necessary to take to
prevent the sailing of a ship on a supposed errand of war are as well
known to the lawyers as those which are taken on a dishonoured
acceptance. If the case can be proved the vessel is stopped, as has
been done, we learn, in the instance of a newly-constructed bark,
which was to have gone by the name of the Alexandra until she had left
England and taken in her guns. But mere suspicion will not do. A
policeman does not capture a lounger on mere suspicion that at night
he means to "open a bank," with a crowbar for his capital. Regular
evidence must be adduced; and, whether the law be sufficiently
stringent or not, it is law. We hear very few complaints when
expeditions, under the most transparent disguises, are fitted out
against monarchies, and when adventurers, of more or less
respectability, enlist men and buy guns for the promotion of any
revolution whatever, except the Southern revolution. Hitherto the law
has been found to work very well. But an exceptional case, to the
minds of sympathisers with the North, has arisen, and those who were
foremost in their ostentatious support of insurrectionary movements in
Europe clamour against the ordinary English doctrine that proof of
guilt shall precede punishment. And even this is not all. The House of
Commons is open to the petitions of the nation and of all classes in
the nation; and it is to the House of Commons, where a Liberal
majority sways, that these malcontents should address themselves for
an alteration of the law, if it be deemed too feeble. No such abject
and constitutional course will, however, satisfy "the friends of
freedom." The Government is called upon to violate the law, to
exercise a despotic sway, and to do on behalf of the Northern States
of America that which, had it been done on behalf of the King of
Naples or the Emperor of Russia, every organ of Federal interests
would have stigmatised most furiously as a proceeding worthy of the
days of Castlereagh and Sidmouth.</p>

<p>Were the Government to take this course, and act upon suspicion
only, it would not only be a violation of British law, and a sacrifice
of the traditions which are dearer to us all than any foreign
alliance, but a direct departure from the policy announced three times
from the Throne. The sympathisers with Mr. Lincoln call on us to
interfere on behalf of the Federals, and to treat the South as
enemies. We shall not do so; but it is very desirable that the country
should understand that these unconstitutional demonstrations, though
they can do no harm here, may produce much in America, and that the
Anglo-American organs are doing their best to involve us in a horrible
war.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Coming Struggle At Charleston</hi>.--The
Charleston correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Mobile Register</hi>
writes as follows:--"The struggle, when it comes, will certainly be of
a fearful character. It will be the shock of tremendous forces, the
relative powers of which are yet untried. The long-mooted question
of the fighting value of the ships against batteries will be brought
to a test more conclusive than any to which human warfare has yet
subjected it. In other words, the Monitor ironclads which the Yankees
claim to be the most impenetrable vessels ever constructed will
necessarily come within point-blank range of the most numerous and
powerful batteries that have ever yet been used in a single
engagement. We have good reason, too, to believe that our guns will be
managed with admirable tact and precision. The more important
batteries are manned by the South Carolina regulars, for whom the credit
is claimed, and I think justly, of being the most expert and practical
heavy artillerists in the Confederate army. The forts are well
officered, and General Ripley, who has made the study of heavy
ordnance a specialty for years, and whose excellence in that
particular branch of military knowledge is an admitted fact, will
himself take command at Fort Sumter as soon as the enemy makes his
appearance. It is scarcely possible that any floating thing can
breast unharmed the concentrated storm of heavy metal from the guns of
Sumter, Moultrie, and Battery Bee, the three principal works commanding
the throat of the harbour. Nor can the peril of running this terrible
gauntlet be diminished by an attempt to pass under cover of the
darkness, as has been the case at Vicksburg and New Orleans. So tortuous
and intricate is the channel leading to the forts that the most
experienced pilots of the harbour would not venture to bring in a
vessel by night, under the conditions which the enemy cannot escape,
viz.--without light or landmark to guide the way. Even when the
blockade-running vessels leave the harbour it is always necessary to
aid their exit by previously-arranged lights (shaded) and signals; so
that it is reasonably certain that the attacking ironclads must either
enter in open day or incur the imminent hazard of getting aground upon
one of the most treacherous bars on the Southern coast, which seldom
yields a vessel when once it has grasped the keel. But if,
perchance, despite of mazy channel, multiplied torpedoes, and the
combined batteries of the forts, some of the nine Monitors should
chance to get into port, they would still have to encounter a
concentrated fire of other batteries, which, as the Yankee papers
have learned from contrabands, 'line the shores of the interior of the
harbour.' And then will come the 'tug of war' which will determine
the possession of the honoured old city."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ALABAMA AT PORT ROYAL, JAMAICA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Engraving represents the Alabama as
she put into Port Royal, Jamaica, for repairs after her sharp and
decisive engagement with the United States' gun-boat Hatteras. Our
Correspondent, a young officer of her Majesty's ship Challenger, to
whom we are indebted for the sketch from which our Engraving is taken,
has also forwarded us a spirited account of the engagement as narrated
to him by one of Captain Semmes' officers. "The Alabama," writes our
Correspondent, "was trying to break the blockade off Port Galveston,
and came suddenly upon the Yankee fleet at anchor. She immediately put
about, but not before she was espied and a large gun-boat was after
her; but, being a good sailer, she kept her position without any
material distance being gained or lost on either side. However, when
Captain Semmes thought he was sufficiently clear of the Yankee fleet,
be determined to shorten sail and fight his pursuer. So, 'easing his
sheets a little,' to use their own words, up comes this gun-boat, <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a vessel of 1200 tons, with eleven guns, with a
hail, 'Ship-ahoy! What's your name, and where bound?'  Of course, the
Alabama was all ready prepared, and Captain Semmes answered the hail
with 'Alabama, and bound to the ----!' and a broadside. The action
lasted seventeen minutes, at the expiration of which time the captain
of the Yankee vessel, the Hatteras--for that was her name--hailed for
quarter, saying that she was sinking, and that he wanted
assistance. They saved 101 men and 17 officers; but there is every
reason to believe that some must have perished, but how many Captain
Semmes never could find out, as a strict silence was kept by the
Federals on the subject. The Alabama came in here under French
colours; but at eight next morning she displayed the Secessionist
flag. She came in on the evening of the 20th of January, and started
again on the 25th of same month, after having coaled, revictualled,
and repaired damages. She was struck in five places; three may be seen
in the Sketch I send you. They present a jagged appearance. One little
incident speaks greatly against the efficiency of the Yankee shells,
one of which was found in the Alabama's stokehole, after the action,
with the fuse burnt down; but instead of there being powder in the
shell it was full of black sand. The action was fought at seventy
yards' distance, the Alabama being under sail, while the Yankee was
under steam. They landed all their prisoners on the afternoon or the
22nd."</p></div2>

<p>The Federal accounts of the partially successful attempt of
Commodore Farragut to pass the Port Hudson batteries have at length
seen the light. The Hartford, the flagship, accompanied by the
Albatross, advanced to the attack, followed by five other steamers.
The Port Hudson batteries opened upon them, and an engagement ensued,
which lasted from ten o'clock at night until daybreak on the next day
(Sunday). The Hartford and the Albatross passed safely. All the
other vessels were driven back, except the steamer Mississippi, which
grounded immediately opposite Port Hudson, and was blown up by order
of her commander. Sixty of her crew were killed or missing. Upon the
other vessels ten men, including Commander Cumming, were killed and
thirty wounded. Confederate accounts state that only two men in the
Port Hudson batteries were wounded. Fears are entertained by the
Federals lest their two isolated vessels fall a victim to the three
steam-rams in the possession of the Confederates.</p>
<p>The canal opposite Vicksburg is abandoned, the Confederate cannon commanding two-thirds of its length.</p>
<p>General Sherman's expedition to the rear of Haines' Bluff, by way
of Sunflower River, has returned to Young's Point, having failed in
accomplishing its object. The obstructions placed in the river, and
sharpshooters along the shore, rendered an advance impracticable.</p>

<p>The Federal General Gilmore reports that he encountered a body of
2000 Confederates in Southern Kentucky, and drove them in confusion
across the Cumberland River. He took 400 prisoners. His own loss only
amounted to thirty.</p>

<p>The Confederate General Forrest reports that he visited Brentwood,
in Tennessee, burnt the bridge, took all the property and arms, and
captured 800 prisoners, including 35 officers. Brentwood is nine
miles from Nashville and Franklin.</p>

<p>The correspondence of the New York<hi rend="italic"> Evening
Post</hi> states that the Federal soldiers in the occupation of
Pensacola burned the town when ordered to evacuate it by Colonel
Dyer, their commanding officer. Both men and officers are represented
to have been in a state of great demoralisation. Colonel Dyer in vain
attempted to stop the work of destruction.</p>

<p>The privateer Florida has captured and burnt the ship Star of
Peace, from Calcutta, for Boston. The Florida has also captured
another American schooner. She was chased by the Vanderbilt, off
<sic corr="Barbadoes">Barbados</sic>, but escaped.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>
<p>President Davis is reported to be suffering from an abscess in the
eye, by which it is feared he will lose his sight. He lost the sight
of one eye some years ago.</p>

<p>The people of the Confederate States are suffering from want of
food, while yellow fever has appeared in the extreme south of
Louisiana. It is feared that it will appear in New Orleans, which has
been free from it since 1858.</p>

<p>The Charleston <hi rend="italic">Courier</hi> reports the arrival
and departure of a number of steamers, and asserts that,
notwithstanding the blockade, Charleston is enjoying a larger direct
foreign trade than she ever had before.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>

<p>President Lincoln has appointed the 30th inst. as a day of fasting,
prayer, and self-humiliation.</p>

<p>The captain of the captured steamer Peterhoff has laid the facts
attending her capture before Lord Lyons, who, it is reported, will
make a formal demand upon the Government for the release of the vessel
and indemnity to the owners.</p>

<p>The American Congress has carved a new territory out of Oregon,
Dacotah, and Washington, to be called Idaho. It embraces 4 degrees of
latitude and 13 degrees of longitude. It is very rich in mineral
wealth. A very few years ago no white man resided within the
territory. It now contains a numerous mining population.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The New York Legislature has passed a bill providing that only
foreign creditors should receive interest on the State debt in coin;
others will be paid with paper.</p>
<p>The State election of Rhode Island has resulted in the success of
the whole Republican ticket.</p>
<p>General Butler was received by the "Loyal League" at the New York
Academy of Music, on the 2nd inst. The address was delivered by the
Mayor. General Butler, in his reply, advocated the extermination of
the "rebels," the confiscation of the estates of the planters and
their partition among the soldiers of the Union. He was particularly
bitter against British Government and aristocracy, and said that at
the time of the Trent affair it was, perhaps, wise not to provoke
England; but he thanked God the country was now getting into a
condition to remember that case. He advised retaliation for the
depredations of the Alabama and the Florida, and recommended that
non-intercourse with England be proclaimed, so that not an ounce of
food from America should get into an Englishman's mouth until those
piracies were stopped. He also advocated the prohibition of the export
of gold to England.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Pacific States.</hi></p>
<p> An engagement has occurred on the Bear River, Washington
Territory, between 200 Federal troops and 500 Indians. After four
hours' fighting nearly the entire band of Indians was killed, 420 of
them being left dead on the field. This band of Indians had murdered
many miners and emigrants on the overland route.</p>

<p>During the month of March 200 gold, silver, and copper mining
companies were formed in San Francisco to develop the mines in
California, Nevada, and North-Western Mexico. Their nominal capital
was over 80,000,000 dols.</p></div2>

<p>A New York journal states that in some parts of the west Indian
corn is extensively used for fuel. Two bushels of corn are considered
equal to one bushel of coal. In Nebraska, where the practice of
corn-burning is quite common, corn is worth 10 cents per bushel, while
coal is worth about 20. Farmers there think it just as profitable to
burn one as the other. This is probably the only country in the world
where such a destruction of the staff of life could possibly
occur.</p></div2>

<p>Another cruiser for the Confederates has left our shores. The
Japan, of 700 tons, and built of iron, was launched not long since in
the Clyde, and sailed on the 3rd inst., just twenty-four hours 
before an order came down from Government to seize her as a
Confederate vessel. On leaving Greenock she made for a given point
between Plymouth and Falmouth, where she met a vessel with
"hardware," consisting of guns, &#x0026;c., which she shipped. On this her
real character was proclaimed to the crew, though well known before,
when thirteen of them declined to proceed in her, and were shipped off
for Plymouth. The remaining hands, about eighty-five in number, signed
for two years' service in the new craft, which was then dubbed the
Virginia, and forthwith started on her cruise. The armament consisted
of ten guns and two 68-pounder Whitworth pivots. She has great
strength and speed.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Town And Fortifications Of
Savannah.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> View of Savannah is taken from Fort
Bloggs, looking up the Savannah River. "Fort Bloggs," writes our
Special Correspondent, "is the left flanking work of the land defences
of the city; and below it, in the event of an attack, the river
batteries may be expected to do all that is required of them. As I
write news has been brought in that the Northern flotilla are moving
out of Port Royal, and from appearances it is presumed they are going
into the Savannah River. The long-looked-for fight may come off
within the next forty-eight hours. I shall be there whenever it takes
place with General Beauregard, who has invited me to accompany his
staff. Foster and Hunter, the Northern Generals, have between forty
and fifty thousand men, but I don't think they will meet with any
better success than Burnside did at Fredricksburg."</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Plantation Negroes Working On The Defences Of Charleston.</hi></p>

<p>Since the breaking out of the civil war there has been but little
planting going on near the seaboard of South Carolina in consequence
of the too close proximity of the Northern forces. The planters,
therefore, are glad to turn over gangs of their negroes to the
military authorities, by whom they are usefully employed in
constructing earthworks. There seems little reason to doubt that the
negroes work contentedly enough at the task of riveting their fetters
still more tightly upon themselves. Nor is their ragged look to be in
any way attributed to the existence of want or misery among them, to
their masters' neglect, or to their own indifference to their personal
appearance. The negro is perfectly willing to go about his work in
rags for six days in the week provided that on the seventh he may
attire himself in a garb of outrageous brilliancy. "The very men,"
writes our Correspondent, "portrayed in my sketch have more than once
made me feel uncommonly mean and shabby when I have met them on Sunday
in all their splendour and been forced to contrast my own well-worn
and somewhat shabby attire with their brilliant costumes. The old
uncle in front, who is shown leading off with his rammer, is what is
here termed the 'boss' nigger or head man of the party. The rest are
under his especial control, and over them he exercises his power in a
right lordly fashion. As those who are working below throw up the
earth, the labourers above, headed by the boss nigger, pace slowly
forward and backward with their rammers, keeping perfect time, and
accompanying their labour with some such ditty as the following:--</p>

<q><lg type="stanza"><l>I don't like the lowland gal;</l>
<l>Tell you de reason why?</l>
<l>She comb har hair wid a herring-bone,</l>
<l>And dat don't please my eye.</l></lg>

<lg><l>  But I do like de mountain gal;</l>
<l>Will you hab de reason why?</l>
<l> She comb har hair wid de tortoise-shell,</l>
<l>  And har movements am so spry!</l></lg></q>

<p>As a rule, the negroes appear to be the most contented labourers at
this and similar work imaginable, and, what with their singing and
constant chattering, do as little for their living as any class of men
I ever saw."</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Attack On Fort
M'Allister.</hi></p>
<p>Our Correspondent writes as follows respecting the attack by the
Federal gun-boats on Fort M'Allister, which took place on March
2:--"As I was making up my packet, ready to send off by the first
chance, I heard of a movement of the Federal gun-boats from Port Royal
towards Savannah. Leaving the envelope open, I started to Fort
M'Allister, on the Ogeechee, 150 miles off, believing that to be the
point threatened, and arrived there just in time to be present at the
attack. There were three turreted ironclads and a mortar-boat engaged,
each ironclad being armed with a 15-inch and 11-inch gun. After eight
hours of incessant firing the ironclads drew off, leaving, however, the
mortar-boat still engaged, which kept throwing shell into the fort the
greater portion of the night. To-day (the 3rd) none have resumed the
attack, but how long it may be before the ball is renewed it is
impossible to say. The Federals are exceedingly anxious to take the
position, as it will enable them to turn the right of the Savannah
defences by reaching the Gulf Railroad. The damage to the fort was
trifling--the parapets and revetments somewhat knocked about, a gun
dismounted, and a few men injured. It is calculated that at least
fifty tons of metal were thrown into the work. My sketch is very rough,
as it was made amidst flying sand and earth, besides which I had to
keep dodging pretty briskly. We hear that the Federal transports are
landing troops lower down; if so, we shall have it hot and
strong."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the steamer Hansa we have received New York
journals to the 11th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>President Lincoln has reviewed the army of the Potomac by brigades.</p>
<p>The long-expected attack on Fort Sumter commenced on Tuesday, the
7th inst. In the early part of the day four of the Federal ironclads
were engaged. In the afternoon seven took part in the
bombardment. They withdrew at five o'clock in the afternoon without
having effected their object. The Confederates speak of one man killed
and five badly wounded in Fort Sumter. The Federal ironclad Keokuk
was injured. The Confederate ironclads took no prominent part in the
action.</p>
<p>The negro expedition has evacuated Jacksonville, Florida, and,
after burning the town, returned to Port Royal.</p>
<p>The Confederates under Generals Hill and Pettigrew, 10,000 strong,
have surrounded Washington, North Carolina, which is occupied by the
Federal force under General Foster, estimated at 3000 strong. The
Confederates have erected a battery five miles below Washington,
commanding the channel between that place and Newbern, thus cutting
off the Federal communications with Newbern. General Foster sent to
Newbern for reinforcements. A steamer accordingly left Beaufort for
Washington, but was fired at by Confederate batteries on shore and
compelled to return.</p>
<p>The siege of Vicksburg progresses. General Grant had succeeded in
placing a battery of 84-pounder Parrott guns beyond the lev&#xE9;e in a
position to reach Vicksburg. Another canal, which is to be eight miles
in length, has been commenced across the peninsula near Vicksburg, beyond the range of the Confederate batteries.</p>

<p>Admiral Farragut is safe, and commands the Mississippi between Port
Hudson and Vicksburg. He is thus able to stop the current of supplies
which the Confederates have hitherto received from Texas by way of the
Red River.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter's official report of his attempt to reach Yazoo, by
way of the Sunflower River, is published. During eight days he worked
his way up with his gun-boats only seventy miles. The channels were
exceedingly narrow and filled with obstructions. The expedition was
finally checked when within 800 yards of the point Admiral Porter
desired to reach. He estimates that the Confederates burned 20,000
bales of cotton along his route, beside what he himself
burned. Many planters manifested affection for the Federal flag, and
the negroes were unanimous in devotion to it.</p>

<p>The Confederates have burned two Federal steamers on the Tennessee
River, and captured the Federal steamer Diana on the Atchafayala
River, after a sharp engagement, in which the Federal Captain and
several gunners were killed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Confederate gun-boat Vicksburg broke from
her moorings during a storm, and floated down the river until she fell
into the hands of Admiral Farragut.</p>
<p>The Confederates have crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico, and
captured two Federal officers and three privates (probably "loyal"
refugees from Texas). The Mexican authorities, however, having
demanded the surrender of the prisoners, they were all released
except one, who was reported to have been hung by the
Confederates.</p>
<p>It is understood that no further efforts to raise negro regiments
will he made in the Free States.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Washington.</hi></p>
<p>The joint Committee of both Houses of Congress on the conduct of
the war have presented their report. It censures General M'Clellan's
whole military course since his appointment to the command of the army
of the Potomac, and points to him as the cause of the failure of the
army to take Richmond. General Burnside's plans for dislodging the
Confederates at Fredericksburg, subsequently to his defeat in
December, are declared to have been thwarted by the interference of
The President, who gave ear to prejudicial statements against General
Burnside from subordinate officers, and countermanded his orders for
an advance.</p>
<p>Washington correspondents agree in stating that the relations
between the British and Federal Governments are very much strained by
the questions of rights of neutrals at sea at issue between them.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>Governor Tod, the Republican Governor of Ohio, has been arrested by
order of the grand jury of Fairfield County, Ohio, on a charge of
kidnapping Dr. Olds, a prominent Democrat, who was arbitrarily arrested
and imprisoned in Fort Lafayette. The Governor was admitted to
bail.</p>
<p>A large meeting has been held in New York in aid of the distress
among the agricultural and operative classes in Ireland. General
M'Clellan, Archbishop Hughes, and Judge Daly addressed the meeting. An
appeal to the American people has been issued by the Central Committee
for the relief of Irish distress.</p>
<p>The majority of the Pennsylvania Senatorial Investigating Committee
report that Mr. Cameron was guilty of offering bribes to secure his
election to the United States Senate.</p>
<p>In Connecticut a Republican Governor and Republican State
officers<pb n="447"/> have been elected. Three out of the four
Republican nominees for Congress have been elected, and the
Legislature is also strongly Republican. The Democrats lose one member
of Congress.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>...Some of our readers who have correspondents in America may have
received an exceedingly humorous and caustic weekly publication called
<hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>, and which aspired to be the New
York <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Vanity
Fair</hi>, after an existence of three or four years, has just
expired. That wonderful rowdy "Manhattan" ascribes its downfall to the
dearth of comic writers in America, and states that an express was
sent to England to implore Mr. John Brougham and another Transatlantic
humorist to come out to New York and revive the moribund journal. We
don't think that the reason given is the correct one. There is no lack
of writers, facetious or satirical, in the States. Indeed, our cousins
have a natural turn for grim humour and saturnine <hi rend="italic">persiflage</hi>. The
difficulties against which <hi rend="italic">every</hi> comic journal in America has to
struggle, and which must ultimately overwhelm it, lie in the paucity,
if not the actual non-existence, of clever caricaturists who are
accomplished draughtsmen as well as satirists. In England even we
can count the really first-rate caricaturists on our fingers. When
Cruikshank, Phiz, Leech, Doyle, Kenny Meadows, and Tenniel have been
enumerated, how many remain? In France, after Cham, Daumier,
Bertall, and Henry Monnier (we don't hold Gavarni or Gustave <sic>Dori</sic> to
be caricaturists at all), the catalogue sinks into mediocrity. But in
America there are as yet no comic draughtsmen with a tithe of the
talent which even our second-rate pictorial satirists
possess.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">...HOUSE OF COMMONS.--WEDNESDAY.</p>

<p>Lord A. Churchill gave notice of his intention to ask the
Solicitor-General, on Friday night, whether British merchant vessels
trading between neutral ports would be justified in defending
themselves by force of arms against Federal ships of war.</p>
<p rend="center">...HOUSE OF LORDS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">...Seizures by American Cruisers.</hi>--A
discussion took place, originated by the Marquis of Clauricarde,
respecting the right of capturing British vessels supposed to contain
contraband of war. Earl Russell, the Earl of Derby, the Earl of
Carnarvon, and Earl Grey took part in it. It was of a precisely
similar character to that which took place in the House of
Commons, of which we give brief summary.</p>
<p rend="center">...HOUSE OF COMMONS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">...Seizure of British Vessels By
American Cruisers.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Roebuck</hi> called attention to the
conduct of Admiral Wilkes in seizing British vessels, and strongly
commented upon the unwarrantable course of proceedings of that
officer.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> said the question was one
of great importance, and all he could say at present was that it was
receiving due consideration on the part of her Majesty's Government,
but he was not then in a position to say what the result would be.</p>
<p>On the motion far going into Committee of Supply,</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bentinck</hi> called the attention of her
Majesty's Government to a statement in the City article of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> newspaper of the 17th inst. referring to the
seizure of British vessels by the cruisers of the Northern States of
America, and moved for certain papers on the subject.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Peacock</hi> expressed a wish for the
production of certain other papers connected with the subject.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Newdegate</hi> deprecated the tone of
Mr. Roebuck's speech, and thought that if we were compelled to enter
into a contest with America it should be upon a question where the
honour and dignity of the country were concerned.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Layard</hi> expressed the greatest surprise
at the conduct of certain hon. members on the opposite side of the
House, particularly after the explanation of the noble Lord at the
head of the Government. The hon. gentleman then proceeded to read the
correspondence which had taken place between Earl Russell and the
Postmaster-General, in which they decided that, as a ship was liable
to seizure by the Americans for any letter to the Confederate States
that might be in the letter-bags, those vessels that were under
contract should not be compelled to carry those letter-bags. He then
defended the Government, generally, in the course they had taken in
their negotiations with the American Government.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Whiteside</hi> said, however surprised the
hon. Under-Secretary might be at the conduct of members on the
opposite side of the House, he might rest assured that whenever the
honour or the interest of the country was concerned the members of
that House would not be deterred by any feeling of surprise on the
part of the hon. gentleman, or of the Government generally, from
asking those questions which they deemed necessary in order to gain
information which would guide them in their councils.</p>
<p>Sir H. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cairns</hi> wished to know whether the
Government had really assented to the principle that the Americans
might seize any of our vessels trading with neutral ports, drag them
into a prize court in the United States, and compel them to undergo a
lengthened litigation before justice could be done to their
owners.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Solicitor General</hi> said that, so far
back as November last, Earl Russell protested against the seizure of
our vessels by American cruisers, unless after careful search and
reasonable grounds to justify the capture being found on
board. Mr. Seward had never attempted to justify the indiscriminate
seizure of our merchant vessels, and had sent out instructions to the
American officers to be very careful not to seize upon any vessels
but those that were carrying contraband of war.</p>
<p>Lord R. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cecil</hi> said that the Federal ships
had unjustifiably seized some of our ships, and, while our Government
was considering what it should do, Mr. Adams was master of the field,
and our commerce was smarting under their conduct. Already the 
insurance rates were raised on our shipping in consequence of
the state of our relations with America, and he thought that the
protestations of Mr. Seward were not of much value, when it was
notorious that Admiral Wilkes was making the most piratical 
attacks upen our vessels.</p>
<p>Mr. B. <hi rend="smallcaps">Osborne</hi> hoped that the House would
repose their utmost confidence in the judgment and discretion of the
noble Lord at the head of the Government, and deprecated a continuance
of a discussion calculated to precipitate this country into war.</p>
<p>The subject then dropped, and the motion was withdrawn.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer City of New York we have telegrams to
the evening of the 18th ult.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> says that Fort
Sumter, although somewhat pitted, is as strong as ever. It is estimated
that the Federals fired eighty shots, forty of which struck the
fort. No one was killed in it.</p>
<p>The Federal ironclads sailed from Charleston, southward, on the
12th ult. General Beauregard has issued a congratulatory address to
the troops on the result of the engagement of the 7th.</p>
<p>From North Carolina there is nothing decisive. A steamer,
containing one regiment and supplies, had reached General Foster, at
Washington, on the 4th.</p>
<p>The Confederates, under General Longstreet, continue to invest
Suffolk, where the Federals are fortifying themselves. Heavy
skirmishing occurs daily. The Confederates have attempted to cut off
the Federals' communication with Norfolk.</p>
<p>A corps of 15,000 Confederates, under Van Dorn, had attacked
Franklin, Tennessee, and is reported to have been repulsed with a loss
of 300 men.</p>
<p>Southern reports state that Admiral Farragut was near the Red
River, between two batteries, unable to pass either of them.</p>
<p>Southern despatches from Vicksburg to the 10th ult. state that
there are sufficient supplies there to last the garrison for two
years. It is fortified by 225 cannon. At present it is held by not
more than 5000 troops, but, in case of attack, reinforcements can be
had. The Confederates are making preparations on the Red River.</p>
<p>A Federal ironclad was abandoned and destroyed at the mouth of the
Annite River, Louisiana.</p>
<p>The Federals have undertaken an expedition up the Coldwater River,
in the northern part of the State of Mississippi. Fifty-three
gun-boats take part in it.</p>

<p>General Corcoran, of the Irish Brigade, has shot Colonel Kimball,
a native American, dead, because the latter attempted to
prevent General Corcoran from passing the pickets. This event has
caused great excitement in the army.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Confederate States.</hi></p>

<p>In compliance with a request of Congress, President Davis has
issued an address to the people of the Southern States. He says that
the greatest danger to the Southern cause is the general planting of
cotton and tobacco instead of grain, beans, peas, potatoes, and other
food for man and beast. The address concludes as
follows:--"Entertaining no fear that the people will misconstrue
the motives of this address, or fail to respond to the call of
patriotism, I place the facts fully and frankly before the
people. There is little doubt that, if the people unite in doing
their duty, the sovereignty and independence of the Confederate States
will be maintained."</p>
<p>A large number of steamers and sailing-vessels continue to arrive at
Nassau from Southern ports, or gain entrance into Charleston. From
March 16 to April 10 fourteen vessels laden with cotton arrived at
Nassau.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Case of the Peterhoff.</hi></p>

<p>It is reported that Mr. Seward is in favour of surrendering
the Peterhoff. The Prize Commissioners at New York hold the mail-bag
of this steamer, and had invited the British Consul at New York to be
present when it was opened. They also offered him the privilege of
opening it, but he declined. The Government afterward telegraphed
that the mail-bag was not to be opened until further instructions. Lord
Lyons demands the return of the mail-bag unopened.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury has initiated the system of granting
some of the vacant clerkships to women. Among the female appointees
is Mrs. Jane C. Swisshelm, a popular journalist and writer of

<p>The New York journals regard the speeches of Lord Palmerston
and the Solicitor-General on the case of the Alabama as betraying a
feeling of hostility to the United States; and all, except the <hi rend="italic">World</hi>,
threaten reprisals at some future time. But the speech of
Postmaster-General Blair, at the late Union meeting in New York, was
much more favourable to peace then the single passage quoted from it
in the telegrams led the English public to suppose. Mr. Blair, on the
contrary, condemned the language of General Butler towards England,
and expressed his confidence that the English nation would see to it
that English ports should not be used for raising a fleet to prey
upon Northern commerce. He expressed himself adverse to any course of
action which should put it in the power of the aristocracy to carry
the English people with them on a question of war with the United
States.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> give an Engraving of the Weehawken, one
of the nine Federal iron-clad gun-boats engaged in the recent attack
on Charleston. This vessel shows only about sixteen inches above
water. Her tower revolves by means of a small engine, and its weight
rests on the central shaft, the lower portion of which bears on the
keelsons. During action all apertures are shut, ventilation being kept
up by two fans, which draw in air from the top of the tower, and the
boiler-furnace carries out all foul air. In case of the enemy
boarding, the guns may be brought to bear on deck, and hand-grenades
thrown from the top of the turret. In the engagement at Charleston the
Weehawken acted as pioneer, having attached to her bow an Ericsson
raft, intended to lift or explode submarine torpedoes. During the
night following the bombardment she lost her raft, which was washed
ashore on Morris Island, and taken possession of by the
enemy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 2,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> great "artillery duel," as American
writers are so fond of calling what used to be termed a cannonade,
seems to have astounded the Federal organs into something like
frankness and veracity. They admit, almost candidly, that the
Confederates have fairly beaten the fleet of the North. We would meet
them in a similar spirit, by saying that (apart from the fact that the
terrible swagger with which the certain destruction of Charleston was
announced has been most sadly rebuked) there is nothing to be ashamed
of in the repulse that has been sustained. The South had done
everything that science could suggest to make the harbour impregnable,
and the advantages were chiefly on the Confederate side. The fire of
the defenders was awful, and yet but one vessel was sunk and one
placed hors de combat, and the Northern commander effected a safe
retreat with the others. A "safe retreat" is, to judge by the history
of the war, the height of the ambition of Federal land captains; and
the Federal sea captains, who have occasionally done much more, are
not to be assailed for having simply kept up to the standard of Union
successes. It behoves us at home to study this conflict with reference
to more important considerations than the reputation of American
leaders; but into this part of the business we do not propose to enter
at present.</p>
<p>Charleston is <hi rend="italic">invicta.</hi> It is said that
Washington, in North Carolina, has been relieved; but we are uncertain
on this point. Vicksburg is described as being prepared for the
fiercest attack, and victualled for the longest siege likely to be
laid. There are the usual rumours of mysterious movements, and of
great things that are to be suddenly done; but we might keep this
sentence in stereotype, as also its usual lame anti-climax, which
arrives with the next batch of telegrams. The war may be said, briefly,
to be in the most unsatisfactory state as regards the North; and the
paper of largest circulation there distinctly asserts that a crisis is
approaching in which it will be necessary to hand over the Union to a
military dictator and despot--the words are the journal's own. It
comforts the people by precedents to show that the natural progress of
all States is from liberty to despotism; so that, we presume, England,
who thinks herself not to be entirely without some little remnant of
freedom, is considered to be in a transition condition. We can
wait.</p>
<p>Meantime, and while looking out for a dictator, and while the army
takes every opportunity of cheering "little Mac," the new made
Presbyterian, in proof that the soldiers comprehend the real meaning
of the elaborate pamphlet published against him by the Republican
commissioners, the American Government, we are told, has made up its
mind to inform Earl Russell that if another vessel of English build
gets into the hands of the Confederates, Lord Lyons and Mr. Adams
shall change places. Of course, if this be true, the probabilities are
in favour of a collision. We think we may assume it as certain that no
one, save the workers of the American press in London, will ask Lord
Russell to propose to Parliament to change the law--the Foreign
Enlistment law. Even to please Mr. Seward, we are not prepared to
accelerate the progress which we are said to be making along the road
to a despotism. We must continue to adhere to the old Saxon rule
which, in the most unenlightened manner, prescribes that there shall
be some evidence of guilt before anybody is punished. The law has been
fairly worked. In one single case an offender escaped us, as hundreds
have escaped from the vigilance of the American authorities
themselves, though they had ten times the means of preventing such
escapes, and were bound by no superstitious regard for the
arrangements called laws. But where evidence could be obtained we have
interfered, and the Alexandra lies in helpless captivity. Mr. Seward
knows all this perfectly well, and we doubt not that at his own table
he speaks with all recognition of the bona fides of the English
Government, though the necessities of party, for which we make all
allowance, induce him to permit agitation against this country, and
may have even driven him to the extreme step of requiring us to commit
illegal acts in order to satisfy the North. We speak of Mr. Seward,
for it is clear that the Government has virtually passed from the
hands of the good-natured attorney, who ought to have been left to
entertain his friends with highly-flavoured anecdotes in
Kentucky. Mr. Seward must understand that there is nothing England
would so much hate as a war with America, except one thing, and that
is a cowardly sacrifice of an Englishman's rights to the protection of
the law, until it can be shown that there is a prim&#xE2; facie case for
converting the protector into a punisher.</p>
<p>We are not, however, in the absence of more specific information,
inclined to believe that Mr. Seward has done more than reiterate the
complaints which have been so conclusively answered by Earl Russell,
even if the American statesman has done so much. The kind of despatch
which has been described would leave next to nothing to be done beyond
a recall of Lord Lyons, and then the fatal preparation for that for
which Mr. Roebuck, in language that cannot be condemned more strongly
than it deserves, needlessly stated we were ready, calling out
himself the indignant reproof of the generous-hearted Monckton
Milnes. For such an issue we believe that no statesman in America is
really prepared; and the mercantile and educated classes would, we
imagine, signify in an unmistakable way, at need, that the destinies of
their country had been played with long enough. The instant
recognition of the South would follow, the blockade would be forced
wherever it interfered with commerce, and if France did not rush into
the quarrel it would only be because her mediation would be sought by
those who have so rudely repulsed it, in confidence in the will and
power of England to keep her ally in good temper. We need not point to
Canada in arms, to the strength of that position about which so much
nonsense has been talked, but which American soldiers are now
declaring to be as formidable as anything in the South; for to the
invasion <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Canada we do not believe the war would ever come. But for
any part of this programme the American Government is unprepared, and
Mr. Seward will hardly have risked new damage to the <hi rend="italic">amour propre</hi> of
his subjects by sending a despatch which can receive no notice beyond
acknowledgment. We should hear, with a gladness for which the American
press will give us no credit, but which the better nature of those who
sent the Griswold to Liverpool will surely understand, that the
Charleston lesson, in which there is no disgrace, has been accepted by
the North as a final intimation that the crimson flag with the blue
cross is not to be pulled down, and therefore had better be
saluted. We write these lines on the anniversary of the proclamation
of European peace seven years ago, and wish we could find an omen in
the date.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">SKETCHES IN PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> is not so humdrum a Session after
all. The old features are coming out, and the only new habit that
prevails as yet is that late sittings are the exception, and there is
a tone of remonstrance about the Lower House against lapsing into that
pernicious custom. It is curious to observe how little influence the
Government possesses in the regulation and management of the
Commons--witness the other night, when the first of the two debates on
our relations with America which have occurred in the last five or six
days was forced on against the manifest reluctance of Ministers. Mr.
Bentinck had given notice of a motion, which would have brought the
subject on; but it seemed that attempts had been made to stave it off,
and it is possible that the formal motion might have been begged
away. But Mr. Roebuck, in an atrabilarious rage, dashed into an
extempore assault on his quondam brothers across the Atlantic, and
proceeded, in his summary and execrating manner, to put them out of
the pale of civilised humanity. He got up a row, and was splashing
about in the turmoil with evident enjoyment, when Lord Palmerston
tried to stop him by the artful device of jumping up to answer a
question he had asked during one of those pauses which he sometimes
makes with intent to concentrate his resentment into one special and
high-spiced anathema. But in vain. Mr. Roebuck had reviewed his
vocabulary of contempt and selected his adequate phrases, and he was
not to be baulked in their enunciation; and he was not. The sensitive
believers in Federal excellence shuddered and shrunk from the hot
blast of his indignation; and Mr. Bentinck, being naturally annoyed
at having his comparatively mild thunder anticipated, was not to be
tempted by the meek request of the Premier to let him move the grant
for the memorial to the Prince Consort before the motions came on,
doubtless in the belief that that subject might produce a feeling of
harmony, the effects of which would neutralise the acidity, not to say
bitterness, of the subsequent discussion. But it was clear that the
American question had got together a large House, the Opposition
mustering in force; and so Mr. Bentinck went on in what would have
been a forcible style had it not been weakened by contrast with
Mr. Roebuck's miraculous flow of acerbity. And so the debate
continued, and Mr. Malins was able to state, with his usual rotund
emphasis, that he felt himself "humiliated every morning" at the
insults inflicted by Commodore Wilkes on the British flag; and
Mr. Bernal Osborne--who was supposed to have, for this Session at least,
abandoned Parliamentary flowers of speech for the cultivation of
cabbages in Ireland, but who somehow or other turned up when
arrangements for filling vacant offices were in progress--was enabled
to assume an air of virtuous severity, and to rebuke those who sought
to promote irritation in America, and who, he insinuated, were in
doubt whether the interests and honour of the country were safe in the
hands of that very Government which last July he himself denounced in
his most powerful and therefore most disagreeable style.</p>
<p>Much more dignified and argumentative was the second discussion on
this subject, which was initiated by Mr. Horsfall in a most able and
impressive speech, and which was supplemented by Mr. Cobden in his
motion from the other point of view--namely, that of placating the
Federals--while Mr. Horsfall demanded that they should not have
everything their own way. No man has proved more practically than
Mr. Cobden his faith in American institutions and American people; for
he trusted them with his money, and lost it. That he is not mercenary,
and that he hardly understands the value of money, he has also proved;
and therefore it is probable that he of all men would be least likely
to have his convictions in a nation shaken by the loss of mere pelf;
but certainly it does seem something verging on simplicity to hear him
arguing, and with no little skill, that the normal tendency of the
Americans has been to forbearance and kindly feeling to this
country. The ingenuity with which on the present occasion he
illustrated this dogma from the occurrences of the rebellion in Canada
was remarkable; and his whole argument and speech, delivered so
earnestly and in such good faith, augured an amiable credulity
which people have somehow begun to discover is a paramount quality in
one whom they had once thought the very type and symbol of a
hard-headed, practical man. In these international debates it was
amusing, but at the same time rather painful, to witness the quiet
deposition of the first law officer of the Crown from the chief place
as the organ of the Government. In the present case, as there were two
debates, although the subject was cognate, the Solicitor-General was
reserved to sum up the case in that which was specially originated by
Mr. Cobden; and therefore it was necessary that the Attorney-General
should take an early part in the discussion. It was cruel of
Mr. Whiteside to say that this high legal functionary had missed all
the points, but that he supposed the Solicitor-General could supply
the deficiencies of his senior officer; and it was cruel of the House
to burst into ironical laughter when, later, the Solicitor-General,
with some naivet&#xE9;, said that he thought his noble and learned friend
had not been understood. But when the House takes up an idea about
one of its members it seldom, if ever, relinquishes it; and so an able
lawyer and a practical man of business, who has fought his way to the
highest positions in his profession, is placed under a Parliamentary
ostracism, principally, as we believe, because he has not caught the
knack of the place. In answer to Mr. Whiteside's call, there came a
response from the Solicitor-General <hi rend="italic">in posse</hi>; that is Mr. Collier, who
intervened, and enabled the Solicitor-General <hi rend="italic">in esse</hi> to hold his
allotted place in the debate. The feature of the discussion, however,
was the appearance, for the first time this Session, of Mr. Horsman;
and he drew all the coverts of the House, for everybody flocked in to
hear him. Well, he was true to his inspirations, for such a tissue of
gentlemanly imprecation flowed from him as perhaps even he has never
before produced. One understands Mr. Roebuck's rugged irascibility,
and the spontaneity of his ire; when he says bitter things,
and denounces, like Habakkuk Mucklewrath, we know that the man is in
a rage, and that the abundance of his heart is pouring through his
lips. But one does not comprehend the cold, calm delivery, in rounded,
polished sentences, of a prepared oration, which consists of the
sharpest and most virulent abuse, which does not seem to rush from the
midst of a white heat of passion, but to ooze out of an accumulated
mass of ill-humour and dislike. Is Mr. Horsman aware that he
absolutely shocked Mr. Bernal Osbourne?.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--MONDAY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">...The Federal Government and British
Mail-bags</hi>.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> made an
important statement with reference to the course taken by the Federal
authorities respecting the mail-bag carried by the Peterhoff. When the
bag reached New York the English Consul protested against its being
opened, and required that, in accordance with Mr. Seward's
instructions to Secretary Welles, it should be forwarded to its
destination--Matamoras. The Federal authorities, however, disregarded
this protest, broke the seals, and took out the letters, all of which
were directed to Matamoras. The Prize Court, going still further,
decided that the packages should be opened, and, in the first
instance, they requested her Majesty's Consul to open them, to forward
all bona fide private letters to their destination, and to hand over
those relating to the cargo to the Prize Court. The Consul declined to
become a party to such a proceeding; and, the matter having been
reported to Lord Lyons, his Excellency waited upon Mr. Seward, who
sent instructions to New York that, until further orders from
Washington, the case was to remain in suspense. This was the state of
things at the time the mail left, and the noble Earl hoped the House
would not press for the opinion of the law officers of the Crown on
the subject, as that opinion would have to be carefully weighed by the
Government before any directions were sent out to Lord Lyons. An
additional reason for asking the indulgence of their Lordships was
that "the next mail might entirely alter the facts of the case." The
statement of the noble Earl was received with cheers, and the House
seemed to feel the force of the grounds on which he declined to fulfil
the promise he made on Friday night...</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--THURSDAY.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The British Mail-Bags In America.</hi></p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said, the question of the
Peterhoff and the detention of her Majesty's mails having been the
subject of discussion in that House, it might be desirable for him
to state the substance of the information he had received that day
from Lord Lyons. Lord Lyons stated that, in answer to his
application with regard to the vessel and cargo of the Peterhoff,
the American Government had decided that they should not release the
vessel, and had determined to send her before the Prize Court. With
regard to the mail-bags sent by her Majesty's Postmaster General, in
conformity with the letter of Oct. 31, they would be sent to their
destination unopened. Mr. Seward also stated that in any similar case
he should proceed in the same course until some agreement had been
arrived at between her Majesty's Government and the United States'
Government; and said he did not think that the law of nations laid
down any precise rule with regard to the somewhat novel practice of
forwarding mails by private ships, and therefore he wished to make
an intimation to her Majesty's Government, but he would not state what
that communication would be, because it was a matter for subsequent
consideration.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Chelmsford</hi> asked if he understood
the noble Earl to say that the mails would be forwarded without
breaking the seal?</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said the noble Lord had
correctly understood what had been stated, and when the
communication had been received from the American Government her
Majesty's Government would, of course, consider what answer they
would give, and what proceedings they would take in reference to the
matter...</p>

Lord Lyons, communicating the information that Mr. Seward had given
directions that the mail bags seized on board the Peterhoff should
be sent to their destination without being opened. The ship, however,
was ordered to go before a Prize Court.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alleged Enlistment Of British Subjects For The
Federal Army</hi>.--We learn from a bluebook just issued that some
correspondence has passed between Earl Russell and Mr. Adams on the
subject of the alleged recruiting in the United Kingdom for the
Federal army. As far back as the 20th of November last, the Foreign
Secretary intimated to the United States' Minister that the Government
had been informed by persons "to whom they were disposed to give
credit" that recruiting for the Northern service was being carried on
in this country by agents who offered large bounties. Mr. Adams gave a
general denial to the report, and Earl Russell subsequently informed
his Excellency that further inquiries showed that the statements as to
the "alleged recruiting in London" were without foundation. On the
18th inst., however, the noble Earl called Mr. Adams's attention to the
extensive emigration from Ireland--remarking that a report which had
reached the Government on the subject was to the effect that "it
cannot be doubted that the emigrants are intended for the United
States' army, and that, in fact, many of them do not deny it."
Mr. Adams replied that numerous applications had been made to him for
a free passage, and that a considerable proportion of these contained
offers to enlist in the service of the Northern Government. But he had
uniformly rejected these proposals, and had instructed the consular
agents of the Federal States to decline all such offers. "I have no
reason to believe," he added, "that any American citizen in England,
clothed with authority, has ventured to act in any other way."
Mr. Adams also appears to have complained of the Confederate loan and
the supply of arms to the South, but Earl Russell maintained for his
countrymen a right, which the Americans themselves have always
asserted, to lend money or sell munitions of war to a
belligerent. Another grievance of the Federal Minister was that
English sailors had entered the naval service of the Confederate
States; but Earl Russell retorted with a request that "before you
repeat your complaints that British sailors have entered the
service at the so-called Confederate States, you will furnish me with
proofs that all British subjects serving in the Federal army or navy
have been discharged, and orders given not to enlist or engage such
persons to serve in arms contrary to the tenour of her Majesty's
proclamation."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATTACK ON CHARLESTON.</p>
<p>Admiral Dupont, who commanded the Federal iron fleet in the attack
on Charleston, has made his report of the engagement to the Secretary
of the Navy, but it has not been published, as the Government "does
not consider it sufficiently explicit." But descriptions of the whole
attack have been given by the New York journals.</p>
<p>The expedition had been in preparation for a considerable time. As
the iron vessels were completed they were collected on the South
Carolina coast, and during the week preceding the 7th of April the
fleet had been quietly assembling in the North Edisto River, which is
about midway between Port Royal and Charleston. The whole force
consisted of nine iron cased steamers or Monitors--the name of the
first vessel of the kind constructed for actual service having been
adopted to describe the entire class. There was a squadron of reserve,
consisting of five more vessels, which were to have supported the
attack, but these ships took no part in the engagement.</p>
<p>The Federal fleet crossed the bar on the morning of the 5th of
April and anchored inside it, in the main ship channel. The old
passage through the bar has been obstructed by the "stone fleet" the
Federals sunk in it with the intention to destroy the harbour; but the
action of the tides has formed a new channel, and through this the
Monitors passed.</p>
<p>The following description of the position of the forts renders the
accounts of the engagement intelligible, and, indeed, explains the
defeat. The only channels of entrance were commanded and swept by the
heavy guns of the forts and batteries. All the defensive works
mentioned, except Forts Sumter and Moultrie, have been constructed
since the commencement of the war:--"To the left of the channel, on
entering Charleston harbour, is Morris Island, and to the right
Sullivan's Island. The batteries on the former command the main ship
channel, and those on the latter the Swash and North Channel. In front
and at short range from these channels is Fort Sumter, with Fort
Moultrie opposite, on the right, and the fort on Cumming's Point at
the left. All the principal channels converge and run between Moultrie
and Sumter, and beyond these are Fort Ripley, and Castle Pinckney. On
Sullivan's Island is a battery at the north end, guarding Breach
Inlet, which is too distant to disturb the passage of our vessels, and
nearer, and close to the Moultrie Hotel, is a strong sand battery
called Fort Beauregard; south of Cumming's Point Battery is Fort
Wagner; and there is another fortification on the inlet which divides
Morris from Folly Island."</p>
<p>The nine Monitors engaged were the Weehawken (with an Ericsson raft
chained to her bow); the Passaic, Captain Percival Drayton; the
Montauk, Commander John L. Worden; the Patapsco, Commander Daniel
Ammen; the New Ironsides, Commander Thomas Turner; the Catskill,
Commander G. W. Rogers; the Nantucket, Commander Donald M'N. Fairfax;
the Nahant, Commander John Downes; and the Keokuk,
Lieutenant-Commander Alexander G. Rhind.</p>
<p>Admiral Dupont was on board the New Ironsides, from which all the
signals were made. At one o'clock, after a short prayer had been read
by the Captain of the Ironsides, the fleet advanced to the attack in
single line, the ships following each other in the order in which they
are named above. A delay of nearly an hour was caused by the raft of
the Weehawken, intended to lift or explode the submarine torpedoes,
becoming entangled. At two o'clock, however, all was clear again, and
the line advanced. The first ship, the Weehawken, was nearly four
miles from the point the fleet was ordered to make before opening
fire; and all the batteries on Morris Island, the ships passing within
easy range of each, had to be run. As the vessels steamed slowly by,
however, the forts on the island were silent. The Confederates
reserved their fire till it could be delivered with the utmost possible
effect. At three in the afternoon the fleet rounded the point coming
within the range of the guns of Fort Sumter and the batteries on
Sullivan's Island. They opened their fire on the advancing ships, and
with terrible results.</p>
<p>The correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, who was on
board the Ironsides, says:--</p>
<p>"Six bells had just struck when a dull sound, like that of a
sledge-hammer upon an anvil, was heard on the bow-port side. It was
the hostile greeting of Fort Sumter, now within 1200 yards of
us. A second and third, more violently than the first, shook the
sides of the ship. Soon came whizzing and humming of rifled and round
shot and shell overhead. Still the successive discharges could be
distinguished. The several reports had not yet been drowned, so to
speak, in a continuous roar. But, hark! there is a reverberation as
though of numerous, simultaneous thunder-claps; now a fierce unceasing
roar vibrating the air with a violence that causes even the solid mass
of our ship to tremble. A look through the open port on the port side
discloses the cause of the furious outburst. The first four Monitors
had reached the converging point of the fire of Cumming's Point
Battery, Forts Sumter and Moultrie, and Battery Bee. One after the
other had steadily steamed, without firing a shot, to the verge of the
concentrating ranges. The enemy evidently reserved their main fire for
work at close quarters; but when the Weehawken had reached within
600 yards of Fort Sumter a long, broad, brilliant flame suddenly
leaped from its side, with all but simultaneous intense glares from
Cumming's Point and Moultrie, followed instantaneously by immense
volumes of smoke and a rain of projectiles that fairly hid the turrets
of our craft with spouts of water thrown up by the shot and
shell."</p>
<p>At this point of the action it was discovered that the entrance 
channels were obstructed by lines of piles stretching across them,
which it was impossible to pass.</p>
<p>The report of the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> says:--"You
can readily conceive that this unlooked-for estoppel utterly deranged
the original intentions. The rebels were quite as well aware as we
that the north-west face of Sumter is its weakest point; that it was,
in fact, never finished, and therefore that it would be first
attacked; and they used means which admirable engineering skill would
suggest to prevent our reaching it. Thus brought to a pause, it only
remained for the ironclads to take up such positions as they
could. And the complication was further increased by the ill-behaviour
of the flagship, the Ironsides. While steaming along up through the
passage in front of Sumter she was caught by the tideway and veered
off from her course, and, her huge iron frame refusing to obey her
rudder, she became in great part unmanageable. This embarrassed
not her only, but all that portion of the fleet following her. The two
Monitors immediately behind (the Catskill and the Nantucket) fell foul
of her, one on one side and the other on the other, and it was full
fifteen minutes before they could be got clear and pass on. In this
plight it only remained for Admiral Dupont to signal to the fleet to
disregard the movement of the flagship. This he did, and
the ships then assumed such positions as were available and they could
gain, the whole number being at the mouth of the harbour between
Cumming's Point and Sullivan's Island, and opposite the north-east
and eastern face of Fort Sumter, at distances of from 600 to 1000
yards. While the man&#x153;uvres rapidly indicated in these paragraphs are
going on, you must not suppose the enemy is inactive. The powerful
work on Cumming's Point, named Battery Bee, opens; the long-range
rifle ordnance of Fort Beauregard joins in; Moultrie hurls its heavy
metal; the 50 guns that line the Redan swell the fire; and the
tremendous armament of Sumter vomits forth its fiery hail. There now
ensues a period of not more than thirty minutes, which forms the
climax and white heat of the fight; for though from the time when fire
was opened on the head of the approaching line to the time when the
retiring fleet passed out of the enemy's range covered an interval of
two hours and a half--from half-past two till five, yet the essence of
the fight was shut up in these thirty tremendous minutes."</p>
<p>It being impossible longer to face the fire of 300 guns of the
heaviest calibre, or to advance under it, the signal was made to cease
action and retire. The engagement ended at a few minutes after five
o'clock:--</p>
<p>"The full extent of the injuries to the ironclads was not known
until their commanders personally reported them to the Admiral in the
course of the evening. The Keokuk had 90 shots in all--19 on the
water-line (12 starboard, 7 port) 15 in the after turret (5 of them
through, 1 Whitworth steel-pointed shot remained sticking in the
wall); 12 in the forward turret (3 of them through); 25 on the sloping
sides (15 starboard, 10 port); 8 through sheeting on after turret; 10
through smoke-stack (7 through, 3 glanced); 4 through the boats; 2
glanced off the deck; 1 cut signal-staff; 3 or 4 went through the
flag. The New Ironsides was hit between 60 and 70 times, but sustained
no material damage. The Weehawken was struck 59 times. The turret was
badly dented, and worked with difficulty. Many bolts in the pilot house
had been loosened and driven through. The Montauk was hit twenty
times; the Passaic 58 times. In addition to the damage already stated,
her pilot-house was much weakened by the loosening and driving through
of the bolts. The Nantucket was struck 51 times, and had her turret
stopped twice by shot. The Catskill received about the same number of
shots. Both the latter had their decks almost torn open by rifled
bolts. The Patapsco was hit between 40 and 50 times, and, besides the
disabling of her 200-pounder Parrott, had her turret much dented and
pilot-house weakened. The Nahant was struck 80 times, and had her
pilot-house almost broken into pieces. Four men were wounded, one
mortally, in it from flying bolts."</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> states that the Federal fleet
did not fire more than 151 rounds of ammunition during the whole
attack.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> says:--"The Ironsides was
frequently struck. One of the shots broke off and carried away one of
her port shutters, and her wooden bows were penetrated by shell,
though they were prevented from doing the damage they otherwise must
have done by Commodore Turner's precaution of protecting the exposed
part of the vessel with sandbags. But the poor Keokuk--she, of all
others, was the most fearfully maltreated. This vessel was struck
ninety times, and she had nineteen holes above and below the
water-line, some of a size through which a boy might crawl. Her
turrets (5&#xBE; in. of iron in thickness) were fairly riddled, and
came out of the contest mere sieves. During the action twelve of her
men were wounded, among whom was her commander, the gallant
Rhind."</p>
<p>After working her pumps all night it was evident at daybreak that
the Keokuk was sinking. The crew were rescued by boats from the other
vessels. At eight in the morning she had disappeared.</p>
<p>After receiving the reports from the several captains during the
night of the 7th, Admiral Dupont decided that to renew the attack
against such obstacles, and in the shattered state of the fleet, was
impossible.</p></div2>

<p>On the Mississippi there was considerable activity.</p>
<p>On the night of the 16th Admiral Porter, with seven gun-boats, one
ram, and three transports, attempted to pass the Vicksburg
batteries. One transport was obliged to return, another was burnt, and
it is supposed that all on board were lost. The remainder of the
vessels passed safely. Eleven Federal gun-boats, including Admiral
Farragut's three, are now below Vicksburg. They have destroyed the
Confederate batteries at Warrenton, about twenty miles below
Vicksburg, and are anchored at New Carthage, where General Grant's
head-quarters are established, and to which place a portion of General
Grant's army had proceeded overland.</p>
<p>The steamer Queen of the West, recently captured by the
Confederates, has been blown up by the Federal gun-boats and her crew
captured. The Confederate steamer Diana has also been burnt on the
Atchafayala River.</p>
<p>A portion of the forces under General Banks was above Franklin,
Louisiana, on the River Teche. The object of General Banks's
expedition was to capture Franklin, where all the Confederates below
the Red River are supposed to be posted, and a victory at this place
would open the way for an advance of the Federals to the Red
River.</p>
<p>A Federal division had made an expedition from Greenville,
Mississippi, up Deer Creek, and, during six days, destroyed property on
various plantations estimated at 3,000,000 dols., consisting of
cotton-mills, cotton-gins, and 700,000 bushels of corn. They likewise
brought away a considerable amount of stores.</p>
<p>The Confederate ship-of-war Florida captured the Boston barque
Lapwing on the 27th of March, and put two guns and eighteen men on
board. She has also captured the New York barqu[e] Concord. About the same

<p rend="center">THE ALEXANDRA.</p>
<p>...The Alexandra [was] recently seized at Liverpool by order of the Government
on suspicion that she was intended for the use of the Confederates. The
Alexandra was built by Messrs. Miller and Co., of Liverpool, for
Messrs. Fawcett, Prescott, and Co., of the same town, both firms being
of long standing and great respectability. She was built, launched,
and fitted out in dock, when, on the 5th ult., a custom-house officer
went on board, and gave a notice to the following effect:--"I have
herewith to inform you that, pursuant to the directions of the
Collector of Customs, the vessel Alexandra, built by you, has been
seized, and will be detained until further instructions shall be
received as to the course to be pursued with regard to her." The
Alexandra is a three-masted schooner, with engines of 300-horse power,
and is adapted for a passenger-vessel, a mail-boat, or a yacht. The
firm to which she belongs state that, having heard many inquiries for
a vessel of that description, they built her on speculation.</p>
<p>We learn from the Liverpool papers that at the close of last week
one or two Government officials were busily engaged in completing the
evidence to be adduced by the Crown in the prosecution of the case
against the builders and owners of the alleged gun-boat Alexandra. It
is also asserted that the parties signing the depositions to the
Government, in which it was stated that the Alexandra was intended for
the Confederates, have received notices from the law officers of the
Crown intimating that they will be required in London at an early
period. According to the <hi rend="italic">Shipping Gazette</hi>, the
case of the Alexandra will be tried in the Court of Exchequer in the
course of a few days. The following is the cause of seizure stated in
the appraisement filed in the Court of Exchequer:--"No. 1. Date,
1863. Seized by officer Edward Morgan. Cause of seizure: For being
equipped, furnished, and fitted out with intent to be employed in the
service of persons exercising, or assuming to exercise, the powers of
self-government in and over a foreign State, colony, province, or
people, the ship or vessel Alexandra, of Liverpool, with her tackle,
apparel, and furniture, as she now lies.--Signed, Samuel Price
Edwards, John King, C. W. Kellock, H. B. Watson." The Alexandra is
appraised at &#xA3;9500.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ILLUSTRATION OF THE ATTACK ON CHARLESTON.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> unsuccessful attempt on Charleston by
the Federal iron-clad fleet has so recently been detailed in this
Journal that it will not be necessary to give more than a few
particulars of the fleet's advance, in relation to which we have an
Engraving on the preceding page. "The attack," says the correspondent
of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi>, "would have commenced
an hour or two earlier then it did had it not been that the Admiral
was advised to wait for the ebb tide, rather than sail up with the
flood tide, as the former would be more apt to discover the locality
of the obstructions in the channel; and the tide turned at eleven
o'clock. During these hours of suspense the eye had an opportunity at
taking the features of the scene on which the great act was to be
played. The blue waters danced in the bright sunshine, and flocks of
sea-birds dipped their white wings in the waves and uttered their
shrill cries as they swooped downward after their prey. Over the
parapets of Forts Sumter and Moultrie the rebel defenders were
watching our movements and signalising them; and even on the roofs and
steeples of the distant city we could see hundreds of
spectators. Distinctly in view were the numerous batteries extending
from the Wappoo Creek on the Ashley River, following the contour of
James Island down to the Lighthouse Battery, on the south point of
Morris Island. On the other side they were more numerous still. Breach
Inlet Battery, on the lower end of Sullivan's Island, Fort Beauregard,
and on up to Fort Moultrie; while in the centre of the picture, rising
as it were from the water, stood Fort Sumter, displaying the rebel
flag on one angle and the palmetto flag on the opposite angle; and
beyond, Fort Ripley and Castle Pinckney, the city filling up the
background. Meanwhile the attacking vessels lay at anchor in the main
ship channel, within a mile of the batteries on Morris Island, without
provoking a hostile shot. They lay in the order named in the plan of
attack, as follows:--The Weehawken, Passaic, Montauk, Patapsco, New
Ironsides, <sic>Katskill</sic>, Nantucket, Nahant, and Keokuk. Five ships were in
reserve. At half-past twelve the fleet commenced to move. The distance
to the positions at which they were directed to attack was nearly four
miles, and for almost all that distance they were within range of the
enemy's batteries. But again there was a delay.  Grappling-irons
attached to the Weehawken had got foul of her anchor-cable, and it
took nearly an hour to set matters right. At last the difficulty was
got over, and once more the vessels were underway. Slowly they
moved up the ship channel. They passed within easy range of Fort Wagner
on Morris Island, but not a shot disputed their progress; they passed
the battery at Cumming's Point, named, I believe, Battery Bee, but
still not a discharge from a rebel gun. And it was not till the
vessels had got fairly between the two upper points of Morris Island
and Sullivan's Island, which are about a mile apart, and were rounding
to make the entrance of the harbour, that the ominous stillness was
broken. Fort Sumter opened the ball with her barbette guns; Fort
Moultrie took up the loud refrain. The various batteries joined in the
deafening chorus, and the ironclads found themselves within a circle
of fire, concentrated from all the rebel guns that could be brought to
bear upon the point." Our Engraving shows the iron-clad frigate New
Ironsides and two of the Ericsson batteries replying to the enemy with
the thunder of their huge batteries.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> sums up the
casualties and damage sustained by the forts in Charleston Harbour in
the recent battle of ironclads against stone walls as follows:--</p>
<q><p>The enemy fired about eighty shots--mostly 15-inch and
steel-pointed shells--at Fort Sumter. This estimate was made from
Sullivan's Island. Forty only struck the work. One 10-inch gun was
temporarily disabled by a shot; one columbiad, of old pattern,
burst; one 7-inch rifled gun dismounted by recoil; and one gun was
disabled for a few moments by fracture of the elevating screw through
recoil. Not a person was killed in Fort Sumter from any
cause. Sergeant Faulkener and Privates Chaplin, Minnix, and Penn,
company B, were injured by a shower of bricks thrown from a traverse on the rampart
by a large shot of the enemy. A drummer-boy, Ahrens, was struck on the
head by the explosion of a shell over the parade. A negro labourer was
also wounded. The regimental ensign was pierced near the centre by a
ball. The Confederate flag was also perforated. There was but one
casualty at Fort Moultrie. A shot from one of the Monitors cut
away the flagstaff a few feet above the parapet, and the staff fell
upon Private Lusby, Company F, 1st S.C. (regular) Infantry, inflicting
injuries from the effects of which he soon died. The closest range
into which the enemy ventured was estimated by the officers of the
post at about 1200 yards. The flagstaff has been replaced, and, as no
other portion of the fort sustained any damage whatever during the
engagement, the post is in excellent condition to join in another
trial of  strength with the turretted armada. Battery Bee, on
Sullivan's Island, was the recipient of occasional shots from the
enemy; but was not in any way injured, nor were there any casualties
amongst the men. The Beauregard Battery, with three of its guns, also
took part in a general mel&#xE9;e of heavy artillery, and twice
received a broadside from the enemy. The battery was in no respect
damaged, although many of the Yankee round shot fell upon the sand in
the immediate neighbourhood.</p></q></div2>

<p>General Hooker has at length commenced a movement upon the
Confederate capital. On Monday, the 27th ult., a portion of the late
army of the Potomac crossed the Rappahannock at Kelly's Ford, above
Fredericksburg, and captured the Confederate pickets. Hooker sent out
skirmishers, but found no enemy. Since that time the remainder of the
army has crossed at three other fords, above and below
Fredericksburg. The Confederates offered no serious resistance to the
passage at any point. The Federals report the capture of 300 to
500 prisoners. The Federal casualties do not exceed fifty in
number.</p>
<p>On the 30th three corps of Hooker's army were twelve miles in the
rear of Fredericksburg. Three other corps, which had crossed above the
town, were in communication with the former. Another corps was
threatening to cross below and assail the flank of the Confederates.
General Stoneman's cavalry were on their way to destroy the lines of
railway communication with Richmond, so as to prevent General Lee
from receiving reinforcements. In this position a great battle or a
great catastrophe was imminent. General Hooker has ordered that all
newspaper correspondents with his army shall sign their
communications.</p>
<p>The Confederates have appeared in Western Virginia, and captured
Morgantown, on the Pennsylvania State line of railway. They have
repulsed Colonel Mulligan, at Fairmount, and destroyed the Baltimore
and Ohio railway bridges at Fairmount and Cheat River.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Federal Monitor fleet is again inside
Charleston Bar, prepared for another attack on that place. The
Confederate Secretary for War has visited Charleston and expressed
himself satisfied with the dispositions made by General
Beauregard.</p>
<p>General Banks reports a series of successes in Louisiana. On the
River Teche he had had three engagements with the enemy and repulsed
them, capturing 1500 prisoners. He forced the Confederates to destroy
all their transports, and gained possession of many hundred head of
cattle and much miscellaneous stores and provisions. Finally, he has
seized the Opelousas Railroad and communicated with Admiral Farragut
above Port Hudson. In these operations he lost about 700 men.</p>
<p>In south-western Missouri the Confederates have been active and
gathered some booty, but have lost a whole regiment, with horses and
camp equipage, which was surprised by the Federals.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The New York press generally considers that the action of Mr. Adams
in giving a certificate to a vessel bound for Matamoras with arms for
Mexico does not justify the severe comments of the British press
thereupon, and thinks they prove the existence of a strong
anti-American feeling in England ready to resent even the shadow of
affront. Some journals justify Mr. Adams's conduct.</p>
<p>By order of the Prize Court, the Cargo of the Peterhoff is being
landed and examined, to ascertain if there is contraband of war on
board.</p>
<p>Several Federal regiments whose time of enlistment had expired had
arrived at Washington and New York to be mustered out. The Federal
forces will lose thirty-seven regiments in this way during the present
and next months.</p>
<p>The 30th of April was kept as a day of fast and humiliation by the
people of the United States.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Master Willie Pape</hi>, the youthful American
pianist lately arrived in this country, has been heard twice in
public, and has more than realised the glowing descriptions given of him
by the leading journals of New York, Boston, and other cities of the
United States. He first played last week at Mdme. Puzzi's annual
matin&#xE9;e at the Hanover-square Rooms--one of the most brilliant
and fashionable musical entertainments in London. On this occasion
there was a constellation of talent, the principal performers being
Mdme. Lemmens-Sherrington, Mdlle. Georgi, Mdme. Lemaire, Signor
Gassier, and Mr. Tennant. All of them acquitted themselves with their
accustomed success; but none made a greater impression on the highly
musical audience than the young American stranger. A boy in years, he
is a man in intelligence and genius. His age, it is said, does not
exceed thirteen years; yet he plays like a well-educated and
highly-accomplished artist. We have occasion to know that he is
thoroughly acquainted with the works of the great classical masters,
and plays, <hi rend="italic">without book</hi>, the finest sonatas of
Beethoven and Mendelssohn--a thing which very few, even of the most
celebrated performers, are able to do. On this occasion he performed
Thalberg's famous fantasia on "Don Pasquale;" and on its being
enthusiastically encored, he substituted for it the same composer's
still more celebrated fantasia on "Mos&#xE8; in Egitto." Master Pape's
second public appearance was at the last concert of the Vocal
Association, where his display of talent was equally striking, and his
success equally brilliant. In this boy's precocity, surprising as it
is, there is nothing unsound or hollow. In the luxuriant growth
of his talent there has not been any of that forcing, that hot-bed
training, which are too often applied to extraordinarily-gifted
children. His progress, though rapid, has been natural and healthy,
and he may be reasonably expected to become one of the greatest
artists of the time.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CIVIL WAR IN AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center">FEDERAL ATTACK ON THE HARBOUR DEFENCES OF
CHARLESTON.</p>
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">From our Special
Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p rend="right">Charleston, April 5.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">At</hi> length the long expected moment
arrives. Nine Federal iron-clads are seen off the Bar, accompanied by
twenty-four wooden vessels of war, while others are coming up in the
distance. A great number of transports having troops on board are in
the mouth of the "Stono" River, and 6000 Federal soldiers have been
already landed on "Cole's" Island. Their object is to take the land
defences of Charleston in the flank, while the fleet make an effort
to force a passage past the forts. Should they succeed, the city of
Charleston will lie at the mercy of the North, and its cause, which has
sustained so many disappointments and repulses, will receive a great
encouragement. But I have every faith in the result of the coming
encounter, for never at any time have the Confederates been more
determined to do or die then they express themselves now. Every
preparation has been made, every appliance pressed into service by
General Ripley, the Brigadier commanding, to give the foe a warm
reception; and, surrounded as he is, apparently by obstacles that appear
insurmountable, his zeal and success seem perfectly wonderful. His
head-quarters during the coming fight will he in Fort Sumter itself,
and, as he expresses it, he will 'fight it low down' until not a brick
nor stone is left for another to rest upon before he gives in. If the
mail-clad monsters now in the offing are repulsed, it will be to
General Ripley and the brave men under him that victory will be due. I
send you now a sketch of sinking torpedoes by moonlight in the
channels by which the enemy will probably advance to the attack. As
this letter must run the gauntlet of the blockading squadron, and may
very probably be captured, I will be silent as to how many thousand
pounds of powder are contained in each of these strange engines of
warfare. In my next letter I will do my best to give a graphic account
with pen and pencil of the impending fight, which will be assuredly
one of the most extraordinary ever witnessed--armour-plated ships against
sand-batteries, earthworks, and brick and stone forts.</p>
<p rend="right">Fort Sumter, Charleston Harbour,</p>
<p rend="right"> Morning of April 8.</p>
<p>The anxiously-awaited attack took place yesterday afternoon, at
three p.m. I immediately started for Fort Sumter, whence I intended to
witness the fight. Upon my way, as I crossed the Battery promenade to
the boat, a scene met my eye which demonstrated undoubtedly that the
ladies of Charleston had no undue fear for the result of the attack,
which, if successful, would place their homes at the mercy of an
exasperated foe. I sketched the scene, and finished the drawing in the
evening, while the garrison of Fort Sumter were repairing damages. The
engagement, of which no doubt you have received full particulars,
lasted two hours and twenty-five minutes. There were eight turreted
ironclads, including the boasted double-turreted "Keokuk" and an
immense plated frigate known as the Ironsides. All these marine
monsters were armed with eleven and fifteen inch guns. They were all
struck by the forts repeatedly; and, after maintaining the fight for
the time I named, they steamed away, evidently much damaged. This
morning we have ample evidence of the fact. The Keokuk has sunk, while
another of the Monitors has been towed away south, disabled. Six
ironclads only are left off Morris Island, anchored out of range of
our guns. With them is the Ironsides, with all her pumps at work,
proving plainly enough that she had been hit below the
water-line. Clothes clotted with blood have been picked up that have
floated from the Keokuk, and there can be little doubt that she was
pierced through and through, and that the loss of life on board her
has been severe. I will forward other sketches as opportunity offers of
the incidents of the fight, the thickest part of which I witnessed
from this place. The Confederate loss does not amount to more than
four men killed and about a dozen wounded. There were a few casualties
here, and we had two of our guns dismounted by the fire from the
ships. The fight may be renewed at any moment if the Federals have the
stomach for the attempt; but I think they have suffered too much to
provoke another encounter. In my sketch of the Battery promenade
during the fight, Castle Pinckney may be seen in the foreground to the
left; then Battery Bee, Fort Moultrie, and Fort Beauregard, on
Sullivan's Island. In the centre is Fort Sumter, with the Keokuk to
the left and the other turreted ironclads. Between Sumter and Cumming's
Point Batteries, on Morris Island, on the right, are other Monitors,
and the Ironsides. The small, isolated fort in the centre middle
distance is Fort Ripley. The Yankee transports have landed some
thousands of men on Folly Island, south of Morris Island, who will, as
soon as possible, receive every attention.</p>
<p rend="right">Evening of April 8.</p>
<p>My Sketch shows all that remains of the boasted Keokuk, that was to
take so great a share in destroying Fort Sumter and forcing an
entrance into Charleston Harbour. In all probability her guns will be
recovered by the Confederates, and the vessel itself may be raised,
should the remainder of the Yankee fleet follow the example of the
Monitor, which has already retired in a helpless condition,
apparently, from the scene of action.</p></div2>

<p>...The operations of the French in Mexico must ere long be conducted on a large scale; and if
the policy which is supposed to have dictated that expedition be
carried out, it will involve a war between France and the Northern
States of America, the former power becoming the ally of the
Confederates. Even if such an event be thought somewhat remote, it
can hardly be denied that where so many small causes of difference, if
not of dispute, exist at present between England and the Federal
States, they may at any moment take an aggregate shape and ripen into
a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>. So much for the prospects of the future; a word or two
now on actualities.</p>
<p>Probably at no period of the contest in America has more interest
been felt than in the movements of General Hooker, the present
commander of the Army of the Potomac. Unquestionably some sympathy is
felt for a Federal General who exhibits at once boldness and
skill. The tactics which Hooker adopted had within them the elements
of brilliant success; but the materials with which he had to work are
apparently unfitted for such a system as he has pursued, especially
when he is opposed to leaders so daring and vigilant as Lee and
Jackson, ably seconded as they are by their singularly mobile
troops. By a bold and unexpected movement Hooker, dividing his forces
and crossing the Rappahannock at different points, succeeded in
placing the bulk of his army on the road between Fredericksburg and
Richmond, and, therefore, in the rear of the Confederates, leaving a
corps under General Sedgwick to occupy the attention of the enemy by
advancing upon the battle-field of Fredericksburg. Not in the least
taken aback, Stonewall Jackson, by a rapid counter movement,
outflanked Hooker himself, and fell fiercely on his right wing; and
for two days a series of obstinate encounters--a battle, divided as it
were, into four or five acts--ensued, and when the latest accounts
left America there could be no doubt of Hooker's entire failure. On
the third day he was standing on the defensive, intrenching himself,
his front completely changed, no longer between the Confederates and
Richmond. He had their whole army in his front and the rivers
Rappahannock and Rapidan in his rear; while Sedgwick's corps, which
had continued to threaten the Confederate army, was assailed, defeated
with great loss, and driven back across the river. The position of the
Federal General is such that he will be subjected to an attack in
force by the Confederates, and, unless a military miracle is wrought,
we do not see anything for him but a choice between capitulation and
being driven into one of two rivers, according to his
selection. Assuming his defeat, the question arises whether such an
occurrence will be considered decisive of the war. We confess we think
not. It would be quite possible for the Confederate Army to follow
Hooker and march upon Washington, but it is much to be doubted whether
such a course will be pursued. Apart from the perils of an attack on
Washington, which city would of course be defended by the concentration
of all the Federal troops which could be got there, so that something
like a siege would ensue, it is not unlikely that the Confederate
statesmen would look at an assault on the capital of the once United
States more from a political than a military point of view. The capture
of Washington by the Secessionists would exasperate the Northerners
and goad them to fresh efforts against the South; while, as a matter of
policy, it may seem to Jefferson Davis and his advisers judicious to let
it appear that the war is not aggressive on their part.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer Persia we have received New York
journals to the 6th inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>At six o'clock on Saturday evening, May 2, General Stonewall
Jackson, with his whole corps of 40,000 men, threw himself impetuously
on the extreme right of the Federals, formed by Major-General Howard's
corps. That corps consisted chiefly of German troops. Without waiting
for a single volley from the Confederates, this corps abandoned their
position behind their breastworks and fled, panic-stricken, towards
head-quarters. To retrieve the day General Hooker sent his own old
army corps, then commanded by General Berry. This corps succeeded in
checking the advance of the theretofore victorious assailants, and
drove them back into the intrenched position lately vacated by the
German troops. The Confederates captured twelve pieces of cannon. The
Federals lost General Berry, and the Confederates are reported to have
lost General A. P. Hill in the engagement with General Berry's
corps.</p>
<p>On the next day, Sunday, General Jackson continued his attack. He
commenced the onslaught at 5.30 a.m., and the battle raged until
11.30. At the end of that time the Confederates had gained about a
mile and a half of ground, and had driven General Hooker from
Chancellorsville, which had been his head-quarters. A correspondent of
a New York newspaper writes of this day's fight in front of
Chancellorsville as follows:--</p>
<q><p>The engagement had lasted six hours, but had been the most
terrific of the war. Our artillery had literally slaughtered the
enemy, and many of the companies had lost heavily in men themselves,
but the guns were all saved. The enemy has gained some ground, it is
true, but at the sacrifice of the flower of his force, five of his
seven divisions having been cut to pieces in the effort, and over 2000
of them having fallen into our hands.</p></q>
<p>In the afternoon several attempts were made to force the Federal
lines, but they were repulsed by the Federal artillery. General Hooker
was busy throughout Sunday night and Monday intrenching his present
position, and was confident of his ability to hold it against the
enemy. Monday was a very quiet day throughout the lines.</p>
<p>On Sunday there was fighting in front of the batteries which
crowned the heights above Fredericksburg. After six hours' fighting
General Sedgwick, by a brilliant charge, captured the Confederate
guns, including the celebrated Washington Artillery Company, which had
figured in every engagement on the Potomac and the Rappahannock.</p>

<p>On Monday the Confederates above Fredericksburg were reinforced by
General Longstreet's column, which had just arrived from Suffolk. This
force enabled the Confederates to regain the positions they had lost
the day previous and to drive General Sedgwick across the river. This
hazardous operation was accomplished between midnight and two o'clock
on Tuesday morning. The Confederates raked the bridges, creating much
confusion and causing considerable loss of life. They also pressed the
Federal rear when they discovered he was retreating, and harassed it
incessantly. With the remainder of his corps he marched off to United
States' Ford to join the main army under General Hooker.</p>

<p>The Federals crossed the Nansemond River at Suffolk, and again four
miles below that place. They encountered the Confederates and captured
eight guns.</p>
<p>General Banks has occupied Opelousas and Washington, Louisiana. The
Federal attack on Grand Gulf failed.</p>

<p>Mr. Vallandingham, the leader of the Northern Peace party, has been
arrested at his residence in Dayton, Ohio, by a detachment of
soldiers, who battered down the doors of his house to reach his
room. His friends rang the town fire-bell, collected a mob, and
endeavoured to rescue him, but were unable to prevent his being
carried prisoner to Cincinnati. General Burnside is said to have
ordered his arrest for making seditious speeches in Ohio.</p>
<p>Mr. Redgate, one of the owners of the cargo of the Peterhoff, has
applied to the Court for permission to testify on his own account. The
Court refused the application, on the ground that Mr. Redgate, being a
citizen of Texas at the time of the Secession, must be regarded as an
alien enemy. The examination of the cargo continues.</p>

<p rend="center">PLANTER'S RESIDENCE</p>
<p rend="center">ON THE CUMBEE RIVER, SOUTH CAROLINA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> describing the sketch from which this
Engraving is taken, our correspondent writes:--"Though we are in mid
March here, the climate is most temperate and beautiful, resembling
very much the warm sunny days of June at home. What the heat will be
in the summer time you may readily imagine. After May, however, the
planters residing on the river banks remove with their families to the
'pine barrens,' or upper country, the malaria arising from the swamps
and rice lands making it dangerous for whites to remain during the hot
months in the neighbourhood of the river. The trees to the right of
the Engraving are three of the loftiest palmettos I have yet seen. The
dwarf plant at their foot is the aloe, which blooms once or twice only
in a century."</p>
<p>Our other Engraving, from drawing by the same hand, represents
the old negro servants of the planter's family among his
children. However repugnant slavery as an institution must be to the
English mind, no useful purpose is to be gained by keeping the eyes
shut to the undoubted fact that, where the slaves are well treated,
many of them grow accustomed to, and happy under, their
servitude. This becomes easier when it as recollected that the
children of the family grow up among the negro domestic servants, and
often learn to regard them with as much affection as they show their
own parents.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">LONDON: SATURDAY, MAY</hi> 23,
1863.</p>
<p rend="center">----</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Bright's</hi> avowal of regret that the
trades unions in this country do not take more action in political
matters has not been expressed in vain. Encouraged by the member for
Birmingham, the unions have been pleased to approach Mr. Adams, the
American Minister here, with information as to their opinion upon the
Federal and Confederate struggle, and have also favoured Lord
Palmerston with a visit in the interest of Poland, and with
suggestions for the benefit of the Foreign Office. Neither
demonstration should be treated disrespectfully, for there is no
doubt that, though the individuals composing the deputations may have
no personal claim to public attention, they have been instructed to
utter the sentiments which happen at present to be those of a very
large number of English workmen.</p>
<p>The unions told Mr. Adams that they believed the cause of the North
to be the cause of freedom, that they wished for the success of
Mr. Lincoln's armies, and that any English sympathy that was
manifested for the Confederates was entertained by other than the
working classes. The deputation would not have fairly represented the
order of mind which is usually found among the humbler orders, and
would have been unworthy pupils of Mr. Bright, had they confined
themselves to these statements and failed to impute unworthy motives
to other persons. It was fitting, therefore, that Mr. Adams should be
told that the educated classes in this country favour the South from
enmity to democratic principles, and because personal interests are
involved in the maintenance of an aristocratic system against which
American institutions are a standing protest. We are not disposed to
speak harshly even of this kind of talk. It is the language which is
taught by the inferior press, and largely used in "the poor man's
club," and it is a thousand times better that working men should speak
out what they think to be truth than that they should mutter it in
secret societies, or whisper it in exchange for pass-words and
hand-grips, or that they should dilute their honest nonsense with the
washy platitudes dear to vestrymen and hireling orators. If they
really think that all the persons who are so much better qualified
than themselves to form an opinion upon a question of foreign affairs
are either haughty tyrants or interested knaves, by all means let them
say so, and thus give a practical answer to certain other persons who
affect to believe that the English workman requires an elaborate
machinery of protection to enable him to express the political
sentiments which he is afraid to utter in the face of his
countrymen.</p>
<p> We are not vain enough to suppose that we are favoured with the
ear of many of these who waited upon Mr. Adams, or that it would be
very profitable to attempt to show them that one may be neither a
tyrant nor a knave and yet be unconvinced that Mr. Lincoln is a
patriot, and that the devastation of a vast and beautiful country is
warranted even for the sake of forcing slave emancipation, were such
the object of the invaders. Were we likely to be listened to, we might
urge that white men have their rights to freedom as well as black
men, and, moreover, that if Mr. Davis were to-morrow to send an envoy
to Mr. Lincoln announcing the submission of the South on condition
that the "domestic institution" were to remain intact, not only would
peace be made on these terms by the next telegraph, but Mr. Davis's
envoy would be the most popular individual in the Northern States. He
would be photographed, f&#xEA;ted, serenaded, and the next week would be
anything but a pleasant period in the life of "Massa Greeley," and
such of his sable prot&#xE9;g&#xE9;s as might come in the way of the exulting
patriots of Federalia. This is, however, so perfectly well known to
every dispassionate person that it is almost wonderful that masses of
our fellow-countrymen can be blind to the fact. But they have been
told that this is a war for the freedom of the slave, and they accept
with child-like faith an idea which it is so very easy to grasp, and
reproduce with an iteration that would be ludicrous if we could see
anything diverting in the ignorance of men who honestly believe
themselves qualified to govern the State.</p>

<p>While, however, the working class confines itself to an
approbation, upon wrong grounds, of the policy of the Government of
England, and restricts itself to a regret that our non-intervention
cannot be reconciled with active measures in favour of the Northern
States, there can be no serious quarrel with men who do no wrong, but
simply blunder. We are not going to interfere for the South; we seize
steamers that appear to have been fitted out with that intention; we
encourage no breaking of the blockade; and Earl Russell and the Earl
of Derby, as representatives of the two powers in Parliament, go out
of their way to compliment the Prize Courts of America, and to declare
that allowance ought to be made for the natural irritation of the
Federals at the numerous attempts made by our merchants to sell
munitions of war to the South. So far all classes are happily at one
and, this is well.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">IMPERIAL PARLIAMENT.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--MONDAY.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">...United States Prize Courts</hi>.--The Marquis
of <hi rend="smallcaps">Clanricarde</hi> moved for copies of any
reports from consular or diplomatic agents in North America of the
decisions or proceedings of prize courts of the United States, and
pointed out that, owing to the acts of the American Government, which
were inconsistent with the law of nations, and pretensions asserted by
them totally unheard of by any mercantile community, a large part of
the trade of this country--that with the Gulf of Mexico--was paralysed;
and if the present state of things went on there must be war between
this country and the Federal States.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> contended that it
had not been shown that the United States had thrown aside the law of
nations, and against all law and justice had interrupted British trade
in neutral waters, and the Government was asked while proceedings were
pending in the case of a particular ship to declare all those
proceedings wrong. The United States' prize courts were proper tribunals,
and, he believed, were impartial, and desirous of doing justice, while
they deferred with respect to English decisions in maritime international
law. It was a fact that many vessels went from Nassau to run the
blockade of the Southern ports, and it could not be much complained of that the United
States cruisers should be suspicious and vigilant. He counselled
forbearance on both sides in any differences which might arise between
this country and the United States.--The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> was of opinion
that the statement of Lord Clanricarde had been answered, and that he
had somewhat rashly adopted the notion of the injustice of the
American prize courts. He thought that this question should be
approached with good temper and moderation, seeing that a large
contraband trade was carried on with the Southern States.--Lord
<hi rend="smallcaps">Clanricarde</hi> stated that the law was that any vessel carrying
contraband of war bound for a neutral port could not be seized,
whatever her subsequent destination might be.--The motion for papers
was withdrawn, and the subject dropped.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Montreal Company's steamer Norwegian, from
Quebec, we have advices from New York to the evening of the 16th
inst.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>On the evening of Tuesday, the 5th, General Hooker, finding his
communications threatened, commenced his retreat across the
Rappahannock, which was swollen by a tremendous torrent of rain. The
south side of the Rappahannock was evacuated before noon on the
6th. Nearly all of the army had crossed before the Confederates found
out that the Federals were retreating, and then they brought up a few
pieces of artillery, which the Federal cannon drove back. On this day
General Hooker issued, from his head-quarters at Falmouth, an order of
the day, wherein he claims that the army of the Potomac had inflicted
heavier blows than those they had received. He thus summarises the
achievements of his army:--</p>
<q><p>We have taken from the enemy 5000 prisoners and fifteen colours,
captured seven pieces of artillery, and placed hors de combat 18,000
of our foe's chosen troops. We have destroyed his
d&#xE9;p&#xF4;ts, filled with vast amounts of stores, damaged his
communications, captured prisoners within the fortifications of his
capital, and filled his country with fear and consternation.</p></q>

<p>General Lee's report is dated the 5th, and is very brief:--</p>
<q><p>To President Davis,--Yesterday General Jackson penetrated to the
rear of the enemy and drove him from all his positions from the
Wilderness to within one mile of Chancellorsville. He was engaged at the same time in front by
two of Longstreet's divisions. Many prisoners were taken, and the
enemy's loss in killed and wounded is large. This morning the battle
was renewed. He was dislodged from all his positions around
Chancellorsville, and driven back towards the Rappahannock, over which
he is now retreating. We have again to thank Almighty God for a great
victory. I regret to state that General Paxton was killed; General
Jackson severely, and Generals Heth and A.P. Hill, slightly
wounded.</p>
<p><hi rend="center">(signed)</hi><hi rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">R.E. Lee</hi>. General commanding.</hi></p></q>
<p>The Federal wounded, 1200 in number, who were left behind on the
southern side of the Rappahannock, have been sent across under a flag
of truce. Some of the Federal wounded were burnt in the woods around
Chancellorsville, they having been fired by the shells of both
armies.</p>
<p>On the 7th the President and General Halleck visited the
head-quarters of General Hooker, and had a long consultation with
him.</p>
<p>General Stoneman's expedition is the most important achieve-<pb n="583"/>ment of the Federal cavalry during the war. The expedition
consisted of 2700 picked men, and a light battery of six
pieces. Dividing themselves into detachments, and giving out that they
were the advance guard of the main army, they penetrated safely to
within two miles of Richmond. On their way they destroyed railway
stations, telegraph wires, and bridges; tore up 30 miles of railway
connecting General Lee's army with Richmond, burnt large stores of food
and clothing, and broke the locks on the James River Canal. On the
morning of the 7th his whole force, barring one officer and thirty-seven
men, arrived safely within the Federal lines, having captured and
parolled upwards of 300 men.</p>
<p>The wound of General Jackson was grave enough to demand the
amputation of the arm. Under the effects of this operation he sank,
on the afternoon of the 9th. General Lee announced the death of this
redoubtable soldier in the following general order:--</p>
<q><p>With deep grief the Commanding General announces to the army
the death of Lieutenant-General Jackson, who expired on the 9th, at
3.15 p.m. The daring skill and energy of this great and good soldier,
by a decree of an all-wise Providence, are now lost to us. But, while
we mourn his death, we feel that his spirit lives, and will inspire the
whole army with his indomitable courage and unshaken confidence in God
as our hope and strength. Let his name be a watchword for his corps,
who have followed him to victory on so many fields. Let officers and
soldiers imitate his invincible determination to do everything in the
defence of our beloved country.</p>
<p><hi rend="center">(Signed)</hi><hi rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">R. E. Lee.</hi></hi></p></q>
<p> General Jackson's funeral took place at Richmond, on the 12th,
with great demonstrations of sorrow and respect. A Richmond journal
says of it that since the death of Washington no similar event had so
sorrowfully impressed the people of Virginia.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi> considers Chancellorsville the most bloody encounter yet fought, and estimates
the Confederate loss at from 8000 to 10,000, and that of the Federals
at from 25,000 to 30,000, including prisoners.</p>
<p>The Federals, under Generals Keyes and Peck, estimated 12,000
strong, have occupied West Point, on York River, and destroyed the
bridges in the neighbourhood of White House.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter has bombarded and captured Grand Gulf, said to be
the key to Vicksburg. This place was a fortified camp on a bluff
twenty miles south of Vicksburg. After the bombardment, the enemy
evacuated the place, after blowing up their ammunition and spiking
their guns. The Federals only lost eighty in killed and wounded.</p>
<p>General Grant officially reports that he met the enemy, 11,000
strong, four miles south of Port Gibson, the capital of Clairborne
county, Mississippi, and routed him, with the loss of many killed and
about 500 prisoners, besides the wounded. The Federal loss was about
100 killed and 500 wounded. The Confederates retreated towards
Vicksburg. General Grant also reports that General Grierson
destroyed numerous railroad bridges, locomotives, and stores
throughout northern Mississippi, creating great consternation
throughout the State. The Governor calls every ablebodied man to
arms. At last accounts General Grant was encamped near Black River,
eighteen miles from Grand Gulf, awaiting reinforcements.</p>
<p>The death of Confederate General Van Dorn is officially
reported. He was shot during a private altercation.</p>
<p>Ten Federal negro regiments have been organised at Memphis,
Tennessee, and ten more are in course of organisation.</p>
<p>General Thomas Francis Meagher has resigned the command of the
Irish Brigade. He says that the assault against Fredericksburg in
December last reduced the brigade to something less than a minimum
regiment of infantry. He memorialised the War Department in vain that
the brigade should be relieved from duty for a time, and opportunity
given to renew itself. That memorial was never acknowledged. The late
operations at Chancellorsville still further reduced its numbers. To
remain in command of the brigade would be a public deception, in which
the military reputation of a brave race would be involved. General Meagher, however, places his services at the
disposal of the Government in any capacity they may appoint.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Aliens and the Conscription
Act.</hi></p>
<p>President Lincoln has issued a proclamation explaining the position
of aliens under the draughting law. No plea of alienage will be
received, or allowed to exempt from the obligations of the
Conscription Act any person of foreign birth who shall have declared
on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States, and
who shall be found within the United States during the continuance of
the war, at or after the expiration of sixty-five days from the date
of the proclamation; nor shall any such plea of alienage be allowed in
favour of any such person who has declared his intention to become a
citizen of the United States and shall have exercised at any time the
right of suffrage, or any other political franchise, within the 
United States.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>A Captain of a Federal regiment has been dismissed the Federal
service for violating the sovereignty of a friendly State in
arresting a deserter and bringing him away from within the boundaries
of Canada. The deserter has been discharged from the Federal
service.</p>
<p>The United States' Circuit Court at Cincinnati has decided not to
issue a writ of habeas corpus in Mr. Vallandigham's case.</p>
<p>One section of the Democratic party in New York has passed
resolutions demanding the discontinuance of the war, and denouncing
the foreign policy of the Administration for having placed the United
States in a position "where even England dares to bully her." They
demand that the Administration shall no longer submit to insult from
England, and pledge every man and every dollar to resent that
insult.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> is now printed on paper
imported from Belgium, which costs there 3&#xBD;d. per pound. The duties
and rate of exchange make it cost 7&#xBD; d. to the importer at New
York. But that is less then the price of the same quality of paper of
American manufacture.</p>
<p>Sims, the first fugitive slave who was surrendered from
Massachusetts, after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, has
escaped into the Federal lines from below Vicksburg, accompanied by
his wife and two comrades. Negotiations for his purchase were on foot

<p rend="center">WARRENTON, VIRGINIA.</p>
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">From a Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Next</hi> to Fredericksburg, the only place of
any importance included within the area of the late four days' battles
in Virginia is Warrenton, sometimes called Warrington.</p>
<p>This town is the capital of Fauquier (pronounced Forkeer) County,
and has three or four thousand inhabitants. It has for many years been
a fashionable resort during the summer, on account of the mineral
springs in its neighbourhood. It is noted for its healthfulness and
its beautiful scenery near the Blue Ridge mountains. It is about
twelve miles from the Gordonsville, Culpepper, and Manassas Railroad,
at the termination of a branch leading directly to the town. At this
point the engagement took place between the Federal Colonel De Forrest,
and the Confederate cavalry under Colonel Moseley, known as the "Black
Horse Cavalry," and which was first organised in Fauquier County. It
was probably merely a skirmish, or surprise, though variously
described as a "reconnaissance," a "heavy fight," and a "terrific
charge;" in which "the rebels were scattered in every direction."</p>
<p>Warrenton has been for a whole year in the miserable plight of a
border town held alternately by friends and foes. After the evacuation
of Manassas and all that section of Virginia by the Confederate army,
it was held by the Federals. For a time its beautiful residences
became hospitals and soldiers' quarters; and its fields and gardens
were laid waste. Then, again, Confederate successes drove the Northern
forces from the neighbourhood. The whole of Fauquier County is now
almost cleared of provisions, the land has remained uncultivated,
those of the inhabitants who could afford to seek other homes have
long since done so, while the poor have been compelled to remain, and
to suffer all the miserable privations of war.</p>
<p>Warrenton is sixteen miles west of the battle-ground of Bull Run,
twenty-two from Centreville, and about twenty south of Leesburg. It is
situated on a high and varied range of hills, which, however, are low
in comparison with its beautiful background of mountains. The
principal residences are detached, and surrounded by trees and
gardens. It has six or seven small churches, the handsomest of which
is the Episcopal church, seen in the centre of our Engraving. To the
right, the flag is waving from the cupola of the Courthouse, which is
situated in the principal street of the town proper.</p>
<p>Warrenton has always supported excellent schools, and boasted a
large and handsome new college, where the education of young ladies
was conducted by professors of acknowledged ability.</p>
<p>To the left of the Engraving is the railroad, which terminates
about 100 yards beyond the little wooden bridge--one of those slight
structures so much more easily burned or destroyed than replaced in
these troublous times.</p>
<p>Fauquier County has been distinguished for the refinement of its
society and for being the birthplace of many eminent Virginians. The
late ex-President Tyler, ex-Governor Smith, the Scotts, the Ashbys,
and Captain Marr, the first victim of the present war, were natives of
this county.</p>
<p>Like most other American towns, Warrenton occupies a wide extent of
land for the number of its inhabitants. The shanty and the cornfield,
with the decaying stumps of the ancient forest trees standing among
the branching maize, are found among villas and gardens; and the whole
country partakes of the wildness of the mountain districts.</p>
<p>In this rough, hilly country, where the roads at best may be
compared to our broadest and wildest English lanes, and are so often
impassable after heavy rains, the importance of a "plank-road" is
obvious. Where the long, heavy, parallel planks are planted firmly and
closely on an even surface, a more permanent level is secured than by
any other means. Therefore was the plank-road between Fredericksburg
and the County (Spotsylvania) Court-house an object of such contention
in the late battles.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">From our Special
Correspondent.</hi>)</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Sketch I send you illustrates one of
the most gallant feats in the bombardment of Fort Charleston. I had
left my position in Battery Bee and reached Fort Moultrie just in
time to witness it. The action was at its height when a ball cut
the flagstaff in two just above the traverse, and as it fell it struck
a poor fellow on the back of the head, killing him on the spot. The
quartermaster of the battalion in the fort immediately sprang forward,
and seizing the fallen flag tore it from its hold and leapt on to the
traverse, where he stood under the heavy fire immovable, until a
jurymast was rigged and raised in the place of the shattered
staff. The soldiers in the foreground of my Sketch are removing the
broken staff from the body of the poor fellow, who lies beneath it,
and who was the only man killed by the Federal fire.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the steamers City of New York and Bohemian we
have New York morning journals of the 23rd ult., and a telegram from
Farther Point to the evening of that day.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal loss in killed, wounded, and missing in the late battle
of Chancellorsville is officially stated to be as follows:--Killed,
1989; wounded, 7867. Between l700 and 1800 of the wounded were so
slightly hurt that they were not off duty a single day.</p>
<p>The chief interest in the recent operations centres in the valley
of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>General Grant occupied Jackson, the capital of the State of<pb n="607"/> Mississippi, on the 14th ult., having previously had a sharp
fight at Raymond and Mississippi Springs, driving the Confederates
from those places towards Jackson. All the public buildings were burnt
and the stores sacked. Several hundred negroes sought refuge in the
Federal ranks. Planters estimate the damage done at 5,000,000 dols.,
and the country rings with the cry of suffering. On the 17th General
Grant evacuated Jackson and proceeded towards Vicksburg. On tho 18th
General Grant met and defeated Lieutenant-General Pemberton near
Edward's Station, on the Vicksburg Railroad, driving him across the
Big Black River, after an engagement of nine hours' duration, in
which Confederate General Tilgham, of Kentucky, was killed. The
Confederates acknowledge the loss of sixteen guns.</p>
<p>The latest telegram received from Farther Point announced that on
the 20th General Grant captured Haines Bluff and the entire works of
Vicksburg, also a large number of prisoners and fifty-seven guns. The
battle was still raging. General Joseph Johnstone was in command of
the Confederates. If it be true that Vicksburg has fallen, the
Federals command the whole of the Mississippi except Port Hudson.</p>
<p>Colonel Grierson, with a brigade of Illinois and Iowa cavalry from
General Grant's army, had made a raid, passing from Tennessee through
the heart of Mississippi, and reaching B&#xE2;ton Rouge, Louisiana. Colonel
Grierson travelled 800 miles in seventeen days, destroying 4,000,000
dols. worth of property, and portions of several railroads, besides
capturing 1000 prisoners and 1200 horses.</p>
<p>Admiral Farragut had arrived in New Orleans. He brought
intelligence that Admiral Porter, with the joint fleet of both
Admirals, had taken possession of Alexandria, seventy miles up the Red
River. On the same day General Banks's forces arrived at Alexandria,
forming a junction with Admiral Porter. Alexandria was abandoned by
the Confederates, who retreated to Shreveport, and took their
gun-boats above Red River Falls. The capture of this point intercepts
the Confederate supplies from Texas and Arkansas.</p>
<p>General Banks has ordered an organisation of coloured troops, to be
called the "Corps d'Afrique," and to consist of eighteen regiments of
infantry, cavalry, and artillery. They are to be organised and
instructed by the best army officers.</p>
<p>At Suffolk, in Eastern Virginia, two Federal regiments fired upon
each other by mistake, killing and wounding a large number. Two
companies of Federal mounted rifles were surprised and cut up by the
Confederates.</p>
<p>A Court of Inquiry into the case of the killing of Colonel Kimball
by General Corcoran has been in session at Suffolk since the 6th
ult.</p>
<p>The new coloured regiment organised in Massachusetts has been
ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina.</p>
<p>General Meagher's resignation has been accepted by the
President.</p>
<p>General Stoneman's raid has been overrated. The Richmond and
Fredericksburg road was so little damaged that it was repaired in
twenty-four hours.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal debt is now estimated at 984,000,000 dols., of which
400,000,000 dols. is in legal-tender currency.</p>
<p>In consequence of disturbances at places of amusement at New
Orleans, the Provost Marshal has ordered all the programmes of the
entertainments to be submitted to him. They are not to be interspersed
with national airs. Several New Orleans schoolmistresses have been
heavily fined for permitting the children to draw Confederate flags
and sing Southern songs.</p>
<p>The military Court sentenced Mr. Vallandigham to imprisonment in
Fort Warren during the war. President Lincoln, however, commuted this
sentence to expulsion beyond the Federal lines. The Democratic party
has espoused Mr. Vallandigham's cause, and public meetings of this
party, approved of by the Governor of New York State, have been held in
Albany and New York City. In Indiana a State mass meeting has been
held at Indianapolis, the capital. The Administration is denounced as
aiming at a military despotism.</p>
<p>A large quantity of free-grown cotton is said to have arrived at
New Orleans from Western Louisiana, and more was expected.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Death Of General
Jackson.</hi></p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Inquirer</hi> gives full particulars
of the circumstances which led to the wounding of General Jackson. He
had ridden, late at night, on Saturday, the 2nd ult., in advance of the
skirmishers, attended by his Staff and part of his couriers. On returning,
the cavalcade was mistaken for the enemy's cavalry and fired upon by a
regiment of his own corps. He was struck by three balls, one through
the left arm, two inches below the shoulder-joint, shattering the bone
and severing the chief artery; another ball passed through the same
arm, between the elbow and the wrist, making its exit through the palm
of the hand; a third ball entered the palm of the right hand about its
middle, passing through, and broke two bones. He fell from his horse
and was caught by Captain Wormley, to whom he remarked, "All my
wounds are by my own men." Several of his Staff and attendants were
killed and wounded. The General was placed in a litter; but the firing had
attracted the attention of the enemy, who opened fire an their
side. They shot down one of the litter-bearers, and the General fell
from the shoulders of the men, receiving a severe contusion, adding to
the injury of the arm and injuring his side severely. After amputation
he complained of the effects of the fall from the litter. On Tuesday
his wounds were doing so well that he inquired how long he should
be kept from the field. On Wednesday night, however, the inflammation
set in, which caused his death on the following Sunday. On that day he
sent messages to all the Generals, and expressed a wish to be buried
in Lexington, in the valley of Virginia. He frequently desired his
Aides to report his hope that Major-General Ewell should be ordered
to command his corps.</p></div2>

<p>The Confederate steamer Alabama put into Bahia on the 12th of May
to land prisoners whom she had taken from on board four vessels which
she had captured and burnt a few days previously. The number of ships
captured by this remarkable privateer was stated by the crew to be
seventy-four, which number of chronometers are arranged in Captain
Semmes' cabin. The Florida had been at Pernambuco, and had also been
committing great havoc on Federal-owned vessels.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the steamer North American we have telegrams by
way of Farther Point and Cape Race to the 1st inst.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>
<p>The intelligence of the series of victories gained by General
Grant is confirmed, save the capture of Vicksburg, where his good
fortune deserted him. His operations, up to the period when he
commenced the investment of Vicksburg, are summarised in the
following despatch:--</p>
<q><p>The army of the Tennessee landed at Brunsburg on the 30th of
April. On the 1st of May we fought the battle of Port Gibson, and
defeated the rebels under General Bowen, whose loss in killed,
wounded, and prisoners was at least 1500, and loss in artillery five
pieces. On the 12th of May, at the battle of Raymond, the rebels were
defeated with a loss of 800. On the 14th of May we defeated General
Joseph E. Johnstone and captured Jackson, with a loss to the enemy of
400, besides immense stores and manufactures, and seventeen pieces of
artillery. On the 16th of May we fought the bloody and decisive
battle of Baker's Creek, in which the entire force of Vicksburg, under
General Pemberton, was defeated with a loss of 29 pieces of artillery
and 4000 men. On the 17th of May we defeated the same force at the
Big Black River b[r]i[d]ge, with the loss of 2000 men and seventeen
pieces of artillery. On the 18th of May we invested Vicksburg
closely. On the 20th General Steele carried the rifle-pits on the
north of the city.</p></q>
<p>The Southern reports tally with the Northern to this point. Admiral
Porter officially reports that he has destroyed the navy yards at
Yazoo City, together with three powerful steamers, a formidable ram,
all kinds of machinery, and property valued at 2,000,000 dols. The
Admiral then sent his gun-boats to Haines's Bluff, to the north of
Vicksburg, which was being evacuated by the enemy, who, at the sight of
the gun-boats, retreated hastily, leaving his guns, forts, and tents,
which Porter captured. The Admiral destroyed all the works,
encampments, and gun-carriages, and then pushed the gun-boats up the
Mississippi from below and opened fire on Vicksburg. For the
operations which occurred after the 20th we must rely on Southern
accounts exclusively. These come down to the 27th ult. Up to that day
three assaults made by the Federals had been repulsed. In the first
their loss is estimated at 1000 killed and wounded. The last was
made by General Sherman, with 20,000 men, and he lost 600 killed and
a large number wounded. The Federal outer lines were within 100 yards
of the Confederate outer works.</p>
<p>The Confederate fortifications consist of a chain of forts 800
yards apart, connected by deep intrenchments, and extending several
miles. General Pemberton commands the garrison of Vicksburg with from
15,000 to 20,000 men. Confederate General Johnstone is said to be at
Jackson, with 15,000 men, short of provisions. General Grant declares
that he is fully able to protect his rear against any attack
Johnstone can make upon it. Four thousand five hundred prisoners captured by
General Grant have arrived at Memphis.</p>
<p>The Confederates are crossing the Rappahannock. General Lee has issued
orders informing the troops they were about to have long and rapid
marches in a country without railroads, and warning them to prepare
for severe hardships. It is not known in what direction General Lee
intends to move.</p>
<p>A coloured regiment has left Washington for the seat of war amid
much enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The New York <hi rend="italic">Commercial Advertiser</hi>
says:--"All the prisoners taken on the Rappahannock have been
exchanged, and it appears that the number captured by us is just half
that captured by the enemy. The South claims to present a list in
excess of 8000, while ours is little more than 4500."</p>
<p>General Burnside has informed General Bragg that be should hang ten
Confederate officers if the Confederates retaliated for the two who
General Burnside asserts were spies, tried and condemned in accordance
with the usages of war.</p>
<p>Mr. Vallandigham was delivered by the Federals into the Southern
lines, near Shelbyville, in Southern Tennessee. To the officer who
received him he said:--"I am a citizen of the State of Ohio and of the
United States. I am here by force and against my will. I therefore
surrender myself to you as a prisoner of war." General Bragg had
received him at head-quarters.</p>
<p>It is officially stated that the length of coast blockaded by the
Federal squadrons, from Alexandria, Virginia, to the Rio Grande, is
3500 miles. There are 189 openings on this line of coast.</p>
<p>The Alabama, in company with the Florida, has destroyed ten more
Federal vessels.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>Only one contract has been made and carried out by the Federal
Government for the voluntary transportation of free persons of colour
beyond the limits of the United States, and that was at the rate of 50
dols. each for 500 of them, in families, to the Island of Avash, near
St. Domingo. Various applications have been made from the West Indies
for such supplies of black labourers, but the Federal Government
declines to make any more such contracts under the power vested in the
President by the Colonisation Act.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Boston Journal</hi> states that Mr. Seward
has severely rebuked Mr. Webb, the American Consul at Rio, for his
letter to Earl Russell respecting his quarrel with Mr. Christie, the
British Consul.</p>
<p>The number of emigrants arriving at the port of New York has
amounted, for several weeks past, to 1000 per diem. They are
principally from Ireland. These numbers are threefold those of last
year.</p>
<p>On the 21st ult. Miss Giselle Meszlenyi, a niece of Louis Kossuth,
was married, at the First Presbyterian Church, New York, to
Mr. Adalbert Ambrozowitz, a Hungarian gentleman of high position, who
visited America for the purpose of taking the lady home as his
bride.</p></div2>

whether the efforts which had been made hitherto by the British nation
for the suppression of the African slave trade might not, with
advantage, be extended to the continent of America, and whether the
time had not at length arrived when it became the duty of her
Majesty's Government to enter into friendly negotiations with the
Federal Government of the United States, for the purpose of
concerting measures for the gradual but total suppression of the
slave trade in the Confederate States. Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> said his hon. friend was aware that the Federal Government had concluded a
treaty with her Majesty's Government, giving a mutual right of search
for the purpose of suppressing the slave trade. With regard to the
Confederate States, they had passed a law which rendered the slave
trade highly penal; but the Federal Government had no relation to the
Confederate States except the relation of war; and, as her Majesty's
Government had not as yet acknowledged the independence of the
Confederates, no communication could take place between her Majesty's
Government and those States. In the course of time, if things should
alter, they hoped that if the Confederate States succeeded in
establishing their independence they would adopt measures similar to
those adopted by the Federal States.</p></div2>

<p>Two telegraphic messages, addressed to Mr. Cyrus Field, which
left San Francisco June 2, at 9.20 p.m., were brought by the China,
which sailed from New York on the morning of the 3rd, and arrived at
Queenstown on Friday night. In the first message Mr. M'Clellish, the
director of the Colombia telegraph, San Francisco, congratulates
Mr. Field on the encouraging prospect of his final effort to lay the
Atlantic cable. In the second message Mr. H. W. Carpentier, president
of the Overland Telegraph Company, San Francisco, says:--"We
congratulate you on the prospect of the early success of your great
enterprise. In the meantime we know the shores of the Pacific are not
idle. Already we talk to you across an entire continent, as if face to
face. Next year I hope will find you in communication with Oregon,
Victoria, and British Colombia; another year with Mexico; and three
years with London and Paris by way of the Amoor and St. Petersburg."
The substance of the above messages was dispatched to St. Petersburg
on Saturday morning, having been sent from San Francisco in the
Pacific to St. Petersburg on the Neva, in 10&#xBD; days, 9&#xBD; of which were
consumed in traversing the Atlantic by steamer. The messages in
question demonstrate that, when an Atlantic cable is successfully
laid, St. Petersburg and the great telegraphic system of Russia,
reaching almost to the frontiers of China, will be able to communicate
with San Francisco and the British possessions on the Pacific within
twenty-four hours.</p></div2>

of the 6th inst.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.</hi></p>

<p>General Lee has evacuated Fredericksburg and abandoned the line of
the Rappahannock. It is not known where he is gone. General Hooker has
crossed the river and occupied Fredericksburg.</p>
<p>The intelligence from Vicksburg reaches to the 2nd inst., at which
date General Grant had planted siege-guns close to the works. One
division of General Grant's army has gone up the Yazoo
River. Confederate General Johnstone is at Jackson. On the 26th
ult., the gun-boat <sic>Cincinnatti</sic>, while attempting to pass Vicksburg, was
sunk by the fire of the Confederate batteries. More then twenty of her
crew were either killed by the enemy's shot or drowned when the vessel
sank.</p>
<p>The Confederate defences at Port Hudson were assaulted on the 27th
ult. by the Federals, under General Banks. The defences were completely
invested, while gun-boats co-operated from the Mississippi. The
assault, however, we are told, was only "partially successful," and
3000 Federal soldiers were killed or wounded, but "fighting was still
progressing."</p>
<p>Letters from New Orleans, of the 23rd ult., report that two
Confederate ironclads from Mobile had run out of the harbour and
captured the Federal ship of war Vincennes and sunk the store-ship
Relief, which were lying at Ship Island.</p>
<p>A body of Federal cavalry was making a successful inroad into
Alabama, had captured some prisoners and supplies at Florence, and was
destroying all stores, mills, granaries, &#x0026;c., as it proceeded
through the country.</p>
<p>The vanguard of General Price's army crossed the Arkansas River at

forced to fall back by the Federals, under Colonel Phillips. In the
skirmishing that occurred Colonel Phillips lost thirty men killed.</p>
<p>General Hunter is reported to have notified to the Confederates
that, unless the order for the execution of white officers of negro
troops was immediately rescinded, he should execute every Southern
officer and slaveholder in his possession.</p>
<p>Blockade-running at Charleston is said to be very active. Several
captures of blockade runners are reported.</p>
<p>Admiral Foote is to relieve Admiral Dupont in the command of the
South Atlantic squadron.</p>
<p>Commodore Lardner is to supersede Admiral Wilkes in the West <pb n="663"/> Indies. It is asserted that Wilkes has been superseded in
consequence of representations made at Washington by Lord Lyons.</p>

<p>The Great Eastern sailed from New York on the 6th inst.</p>
<p>A great Democratic meeting, held in New York, has passed
resolutions, declaring that the Federal Government had no right to
coerce the States by military force, and recommending that hostilities
should be suspended, and that a convention should be summoned to
settle existing differences. Fernando Wood was the chief speaker.</p>
<p>Large Vallandigham meetings have been held in Buffalo, Newark,
Philadelphia, and other places.</p>
<p>General Burnside is carrying matters with a high hand in his
command, and some of his proceedings in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Times</hi>,
which he had suppressed, had caused apprehensions of a collision
between the people and the military at Chicago. President Lincoln,
moved, no doubt, by the warmth with which the Illinois Legislature
was proceeding to act in the matter, has revoked General Burnside's
order; and the <hi rend="italic">Chicago Times</hi> has consequently
reappeared.</p>
<p>The Chicago convention for the construction of a canal between the 
Mississippi and the Atlantic was very largely attended, and a
committee has been appointed to make arrangements for carrying out
the undertaking.</p>
<p>That the sympathies of the Dissenters of the South are with its
struggle for independence is shown by a document published this week
by the London Confederate organ, the <hi rend="italic">Index</hi>. It
is entitled "An Address to Christians throughout the World," and is
signed by ninety-six ministers of various Christian
denominations--including Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians,
Presbyterians, Lutherans, German Reformed, and some smaller bodies--of
the Confederate States of America, with the annexed notice, that "its
origin was from no political source whatever, but from a conference of 
Ministers of the Gospel in the city of Richmond." The
subscribers condemn the Northern President's "emancipation
proclamation" as a violation of the laws of civilised warfare and an
attempted barbarity. They ask if it be possible that extermination can
be desired by Christians; and finally go on to condemn abolitionism in
terms as strong as those lately adopted by the Bishops of the American
Church.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">MASTER WILLIE PAPE, THE AMERICAN</p>
<p rend="center">PIANIST.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Willie Barnesmore Pape</hi> was born at Mobile,
Alabama, on the 27th of February, 1850. His talent for music was
noticed when only four years old. In 1854 his father commenced giving
him instruction, and such was his progress that he played at an
exhibition of the new organ of St. John's Cathedral, in Mobile, one of
Bach's voluntaries, before an audience of over 2000 persons. In 1858
he was admitted a member of the Alabama Philharmonic Society, and up
to January, 1861, he had the honour to be a soloist at every concert
given by that society.</p>
<p>At this time his father was advised to place him under some
distinguished master in Europe, and for this purpose he left Mobile in
January, 1858, and was about taking passage for England when the
intelligence arrived of the secession of Alabama from the Union. This
determined his father to remain for a time in New York, until the
result of this disunion sentiment should be known. In the meantime the
boy was placed under the tuition of Sebastian Bach Mills, a graduate
of Leipsic, with whom he went through a course of classical study.</p>
<p>Master Pape appeared publicly in New York for the first time in
May, 1861, in a course of soir&#xE9;es at the <sic>Stuveyscent</sic> Institute, with
Mdme. Anna Bishop, and astonished the public by his extraordinary
execution and wonderful memory.</p>
<p>In July he made his first appearance at the Academy of Music, New
York, playing pieces by Beethoven, Thalberg, and Liszt. In February,
1862, he accepted an engagement in Havannah, where he secured the
patronage of the Captain-General, Count Serrano. Alter spending a few
weeks in Havannah he returned to the United States, and was invited by
the Philharmonic Society of Brooklyn to be their soloist at their
concert of the 8th of May, at which he met with the most marked
success, both from the audience and the press. After a short
engagement in New York with Mdlle. Patti and other distinguished
artists, he took a tour through Canada, making the acquaintance of the
Governor-General, Lord Munck, and other noblemen and gentlemen, who
took a kindly interest in the young pianist and gave him introductory
letters to many influential personages in England. Master Pape made
his first public appearance in England at Mdme. Puzzi's matin&#xE9;e
at the Hanover-square Rooms on April 27, where he made a most successful
d&#xE9;but, and was highly spoken of by all the leading journals. He has
since played again at the Hanover-square Rooms and at St. James's Hall
with great applause, and he has altogether, during the short time he
has been in England, achieved a most legitimate and marked
success.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">FOREIGN AND COLONIAL NEWS.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.--Vicksburg and Port
Hudson.</hi></p>
<p>According to the last intelligence from America little progress
has been made by either party in any quarter.</p>
<p>Vicksburg and Port Hudson still held out. General Grant reports
that the siege of the former was progressing satisfactorily; but the
Southern advices state that General Pemberton has announced his
confidence of holding the fortress, and that General Johnstone was to 
take his time to organise his forces.</p>
<p>Richmond papers of the 6th publish the following speech of General
Pemberton to his army:--</p>
<q><p>You have heard that I was incompetent, a traitor, and that it
was my intention to sell Vicksburg. Follow me, and you will see the
cost at which I will sell Vicksburg; when the last pound of beef,
bacon, and flour, the last grain of corn, the last cow and hog, horse
and dog, shall have been consumed, and the last man shall have
perished in the trenches--then, and only then, will I sell
Vicksburg.</p></q>
<p>A special correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi>, writing from the Federal head-quarters near Vicksburg,
states that after some of the assaults on the place many of the
wounded lay where they fell for nearly four days, and that "the
proportion of living to dead was terribly small." Few of those brought
off alive were likely to recover. In reference to the defences of
Vicksburg, the same correspondent says:--</p>
<q><p>The rebels are indefatigable in their efforts to strengthen
their works. Every morning reveals the erection of a new work, the
repairing of an old one, or the planting of batteries in new
positions. Yesterday morning they astonished our forces on the right
by opening upon them with two new guns--one a smooth 64 and the other
a rifled 32 pounder. In fact, from all appearances, they are as busy
digging within as we are without; the morning roar of a new gun from
our side is usually answered with defiance by some night-grown battery
on theirs; and, in short, when we move they countermove; we mine and
they countermine; and if we succeed in blowing up or carrying their
first line of works we shall probably find another immediately in
its rear.</p></q>
<p>General Johnstone was concentrating a large force, and it was
thought that his attack on the Federal rear would not be long
delayed. As a preliminary movement, it is said that the Confederate
General Kirby Smith had occupied Milliken's Bend, above Vicksburg,
cutting off General Grant's supplies.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter officially reports that he sent another expedition up
the Yazoo, which destroyed nine Confederate transports. Admiral Porter
adds that, with the exception of some few steamers beyond Fort
Pemberton, the Confederates can now transport nothing on the
Yazoo.</p>
<p>General Banks was pushing the siege of Port Hudson, but accounts
from Mobile assert that the Federals had been repulsed and that the
General had lost his arm. The General reported that the behaviour of
the negro soldiers during the assault was heroic. All accounts of the
conduct of the black troops sent into battle by the Federals at Port
Hudson concur in stating that they fought with great ferocity. The <pb n="687"/><hi rend="italic">New Orleans Express</hi> also intimates
that their appearance much exasperated the Southerners, and that the
latter gave no quarter.</p>
<p>A correspondent of the Cincinnati <hi rend="italic">Inquirer</hi>
writes from Mississippi that the whole country from Milliken's Bend to
Hard Pines, opposite Grand Gulf, a distance of sixty miles, is one
"abomination of desolation."</p>
<q><p>It has been an earthly paradise; lordly palaces filled with
pictures, statues, and articles of virt&#xF9;; beautiful gardens, teeming
with floral beauties, are now all laid waste. In those magnificent
halls where Southern beauty and chivalry were wont to revel, soldiers
cook their despised "sow-belly" with fires built out of rosewood chairs and
curiously-carved furniture, sleep on cotton beds worth 50 dols. each,
and in the morning abandon all to the horde of fifty hungry negroes,
who follow the army and gather its refuse, like troops of unclean
birds which smell the carcass from afar. Among these rich nabobs none
excelled the Hon. John Perkins. His dwelling is magnificent even in
its ruins, and his gardens are still fragrant with acres of
roses. When General butler entered New Orleans he chartered the
Magnolia, one of the largest boats on the river, put his most
valuable slaves, pictures, plate, cattle, &#x0026;c., on board, and set fire
to the rest. For seven miles his land blazed with 5000 bales of
burning cotton and granaries of corn. His house, with furniture which
cost 200,000 dols. in Paris, and the houses of his overseers, all were
fired, while he stood on the bank and watched the mighty
conflagration. In the morning he embarked, a ruined man. I had never
dreamed of such Arabian magnificence as I find in the ruins of the
houses of these rich planters. In one garden I found no less than
seven hundred varieties of roses. This is, I believe, the largest
collection in America. There are not more than three in Europe that
equal it.</p></q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The War In Virginia.</hi></p>
<p>The report that General Lee had evacuated Fredericksburg and that
Hooker had occupied the city was untrue. It appears that, in
consequence of the withdrawal of a Confederate brigade from
Fredericksburg, General Hooker sent a division across the Rappahannock
at Deep Run to reconnoitre. This division crossed in face of a heavy
fire from the Confederate rifle-pits on the opposite shore, and, after
capturing 100 Confederates in the rifle-pits and ascertaining that
Longstreet was there in force, crossed the river with the loss of
forty men.</p>
<p>On the 9th there was a severe cavalry engagement on the
Rappahannock. Lee had assembled a force of cavalry at Culpepper
Courthouse for a raid into Maryland, and three brigades of Federal
Cavalry and 2000 infantry crossed the river at Beverley Ford to attack
them. A fight ensued, which lasted all day, when, heavy infantry
reinforcements reaching the Confederates, the Federals retired, taking
with them their dead and wounded. The object of the expedition, to
prevent the raid, is said to have been accomplished.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> thus epitomises the great
cavalry fight beyond the Rappahannock:--</p>
<q><p>At daylight on Tuesday, the 9th, General Pleasanton crossed the
Rappahannock in two columns, the right at Beverley's Ford and the left
at Kelly's Ford, both fords being captured without much loss. The
right column, commanded by Bufford, a mile from the river, came upon a
brigade of Confederate cavalry just aroused from their sleep, when the
fight commenced, and continued from five a.m. till three p.m., by which
time the entire Confederate force, under General Stuart, consisting of
12,000 cavalry and 16 pieces of artillery, had been engaged, and
driven back three miles on the right and five on the left with slight
loss, the left column, under Gregg, having formed a junction with the
right about two p.m. near Brandy Station. At three o'clock the fight
was discontinued, the rebels having been driven back upon strong
infantry supports, which were hurried up by rail from Culpepper,
supposed to be a part of General Longstreet's force; and our forces
returned almost unmolested to this side of the river. The
Confederate force proved to be more numerous than ours; but,
notwithstanding this advantage, they were driven back with a loss of
twenty and a stand of colours. Important papers were taken in the
camps, by which it appears that General Stuart was to start on his
great raid through the loyal States, passing through the Shenandoah
Valley. This enterprise has now probably been postponed for a
time.</p></q>
<p>Several plundering expeditions have been sent in different
directions by the Federals, and a great deal of property has been
destroyed.</p>

<p>The Democratic State Convention of Ohio, after having unanimously
nominated Mr. Vallandigham for the governorship, appointed a committee
to demand his release of the President. Mr. Vallandigham is said to
have reached a Southern port, intending to sail for Nassau.</p>
<p>The Governor of Illinois has prorogued the State Legislature till
the 18th inst. Sixty-five Republicans left the Legislature, thereby
preventing a quorum; but the Democrats refused to recognise the
prorogation, and entered a protest against the Governor for
unconstitutional usurpation and the revolutionary breaking up of the
Legislature. The Governor's pretext for his action was that there was
disagreement between both Houses on the subject of adjournment. Great
indignation was manifested among the Democrats.</p>
<p>A meeting has been held to raise 10,000 negroes for General
Fremont. It was announced that President Lincoln had consented to give
Fremont a department if negroes were raised.</p>
<p>President Lincoln, in reply to a Missouri committee of Germans,
stated that Generals Fremont, Siegel, and Butler were not
systematically kept out of command, but had by their own action placed
themselves in their present position. He said that he favoured gradual
emancipation. His being President might be a misfortune; but having
been elected he meant to be President, and perform his duty if he died
for it.</p>
<p>The enrolment is being resisted in Indiana. The Provost Marshal and
his assistants have been shot. Considerable excitement prevails, and a
military force has been sent to the scene of disorder.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan has reviewed two returned regiments from the
balcony of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. Tremendous enthusiasm was displayed
for him by the soldiers and people.</p>
<p>A Democratic meeting has been called in Brooklyn to denounce the
usurpation of the Administration.</p>
<p>The editors of the New York journals have passed resolutions
asserting their right to criticise the acts of the Administration and
its subordinates, and denying the right of the military to suppress
papers published far from the seat of war.</p>
<p>A strike of the stevedores and longshore men is assuming a
formidable shape in New York, and all the men refusing to join are
threatened with violence. The Government vessels are being loaded by
Government officials under a guard of soldiers for their protection
against the longshore men.</p>
<p>In the case of the Dolphin it has been decided that a vessel
sailing for Nassau with the intention of proceeding thence to a

case of the Pearl.</p>
<p>Eight schooners are reported to have been captured in the Gulf.</p>

<p rend="center">THE BATTLE-FIELDS OF VIRGINIA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> present our readers with a
carefully-prepared Map of the great battle-fields round Washington and
Richmond. The majority of the Maps hitherto published have not been
compiled with sufficient care and knowledge to render them reliable
or intelligent guides in the great military movements that have been
followed with so much interest. We understand, however, that an
officer of General Lee's army, who served with that General and
Generals Jackson and Longstreet from the beginning of the struggle
until the battle of Fredericksburg, is in England and preparing an
authentic series of maps of the war.</p>
<p>The successive campaigns of M'Clellan, Pope, Burnside, and Hooker
are no doubt fresh in the memory of our readers. The map which we
offer them will, however, enable them more clearly to discern the
positions of the contending forces and to appreciate the strategic art
by which Richmond and Washington, the two capitals of the rival
States, have been in turn threatened and defended. It will be found
useful, also, in understanding the future military movements of which
the old State of Virginia will in all probability be yet the
scene.</p>
<p>With this preface we will proceed to a more detailed account of the
various battles. The country represented on the map is about 200 miles
long by 140 broad. The battles fought thereon ranged, therefore, over
a space similar to that extending between London and the Scottish
border. The figures used, it will be seen, are of two characters. The
larger denote twenty-four successive battle-fields, of more or less
importance; the smaller indicate the several occasions and the various
routes by which the masterly marches of the late General Jackson to
the rear of the Federal armies contributed to defeat their purpose. It
should also be said that, for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary
detail and consequent confusion, no towns have been denoted upon our
map save such as are of military or strategic importance. We shall
now proceed to explain the battle-fields in detail, and in their
arithmetical, which will also be found to be their chronological,
order.</p>
<p>1. Yorktown (from April 6 to May 4, 1862).--It was from this point
that the first noxious advance upon Richmond was made. It will be
remembered that when General M'Clellan approached Richmond from Fort
Monroe, with an army of 158,000 men and a large fleet of gun-boats,
the Confederate General M'Gruder (now in Texas) threw a line of works
across from Yorktown to the James River, distance about twelve
miles. A portion of it, however, was composed of mill-dams and
swamps. General Joseph Johnston arrived with his army from the
Rappahannock in time to stop the progress of the Federal General, who
could otherwise have proceeded directly to Richmond, as M'Gruder only
had 5000 men under his command. Upon General M'Clellan being
reinforced by his iron-clad gun-boats Johnston had to abandon his
works, lest his supplies, which reached him by steamers, &#x0026;., on
York River, should be cut off. There were several sanguinary assaults
upon Johnston's works; but they failed, with considerable loss to
the Federals. Artillery duels continued for some forty days.</p>
<p>2. At Williamsburg (May 5, 1862) the Federals fell with force upon
Johnston's rear as he retired towards Richmond. This action was very
hotly contested, and resulted in great slaughter, the total killed
and wounded reaching 5400. The Federals fought long and well; but they
could not compass impossibilities--the state of the roads and the
heroic endurance of the Confederates baffling all their efforts.</p>
<p> 3. Barhamsville (May 7th).--Here General M'Clellan next landed
20,000 men, supported by a fleet of vessels, intending to cut off the
rearguard and waggon-train of Johnston, under command of General
G. W. Smith, which must necessarily pass within two miles of this
point. General Smith directed Brigadier-General Whiting, with 8000 men,
to attack this force and drive them back to their boats. So unexpected
an attack in the dense forests, where Texan rifles lurked behind
every tree, had its effect, and the trains passed in safety all that
day.</p>
<p>4. "The Seven Pines" and "The Fair Oaks" (May 31 and June
1).--General Johnston, being followed by M'Clellan across the
Chickahominy, turned upon and attacked him. The action ceased after
dark, General Johnston being severely wounded. The lateness of the
hour and the loss of General Johnston rendered the hard day's struggle
fruitless, although the Confederates held the field. On the 1st of
June, 1862, General Lee assumed the general command of the
Confederate forces.</p>
<p>5 and 6. Battles near Mechanicsville (June 26).--General Jackson at
this time was near Mechum's River. General Lee, knowing that General
M'Clellan had spies in Richmond, used them to mislead him. He ordered
General Whiting to take a division and proceed by night, with secrecy
and dispatch, vi&#xE2; Lynchburg and Charlottesville, to Mechum's
River (about 200 miles), and report to General Jackson.</p>
<p>While General M'Clellan was telegraphing to President Lincoln in
Washington, and General Banks at Winchester, to look out for Stonewall
Jackson, who had been thus heavily reinforced and might threaten either
place, Jackson was, by forced marches (see 1 and arrows denoting his
route), taking those very reinforcements back towards Richmond; and
before M'Clellan suspected it he was in his rear, some miles
north-east of Mechanicsville. As soon as Lee knew of Jackson's arrival at
Ashland, Longstreet and Hill passed the Chickahominy and swept down
upon Mechanicsville, and on Thursday, June 26, began a series of
battles, in which the Federals fought well and long, but were only
saved from entire destruction by the slow movements of one of the
Confederate Generals and the admirable tact and skill of General
M'Clellan in the use of his splendid and numerous artillery. These
battles continued for seven days, and were fought over twenty-five
miles of ground, cumbered with dead men and horses, waggons, cannon,
muskets, blankets, &#x0026;.</p>
<p>7. Cold Harbour and Gain's Farm.--These were the battle-fields of
June 27, when General Hood's Texans, at command of General Whiting,
stormed the triple works of M'Clellan; and Jackson, Longstreet, the
Hills, &#x0026;., fought over miles of ground.</p>
<p>8. Battles were fought at White Oak Swamp, Sunday and Monday, June
29-30.</p>
<p>9. Malvern Hill, the scene of the terrible action of Tuesday, July
1. In the above engagements the losses can hardly be estimated. They
have been computed from 25,000 to 30,000. Their result was to deliver
Richmond and to endanger Washington.</p>
<p>10. Second battle at Malvern Hill (August 5-6).</p>
<p>11. August 8 and 9.--Jackson, whose line of march will be found
denoted by the smaller figure 2 and arrows, here defeated Banks at
Cedar Mountain (also called "South-west Mountain" and "Slaughter's
Mountain"); loss about 2500.</p>
<p>12.- Artillery duel and skirmishing were continued along the
Rappahannock River.</p>
<p>13. August 29 and 30.--Jackson here fought the second battle of
Manassas. The small figure 2 and arrows show the course Jackson took to
get in Pope's rear, Pope having fallen back to Warrenton. Jackson had
marched day and night some fifty miles through Jefferson, Orleans, and
Salem, meeting on the way and driving back to Alexandria the forces
sent out to capture General Stuart. He then took and destroyed
railroad trains and immense stores that he found at Manassas; and,
when Pope sent several divisions to surround him, he met and fought them
separately, holding them in check until Longstreet came up.</p>
<p>14. Longstreet, stopped by M'Dowell at Thoroughfare Gap, forced his
way through, after an action of a few hours, hastening to reinforce
Jackson.</p>
<p>15. Jackson's battle-field at Sudley, and Longstreet's at Groveton
and Manassas. The actions began on Friday, Aug. 29, 1862, and were
renewed on Saturday, ending, after dark, in the rout of the Federals.
The line of battle extended in a crescent four miles long, and crossed
that of 1861 (called "Bull Run") at right angles.</p>
<p>16. Battle of Chantilly (September 1). The small figure 3 and
arrows denote Jackson's route in again getting on the Federal
flank. On Sunday, after marching and fighting for a week, Jackson
again sought the Federal rear, at Fairfax Court House. General Pope
sent General Kearney and others to hold him in check at Chantilly
while he drew off his troops to Washington. Kearney was killed. The
Federals fought well in all these engagements, but were compelled to
seek shelter in the works around Washington.</p>
<p>17. Braddock's Gap, or South Mountain. General D. H. Hill here held
M'Clellan in check until a portion of Longstreet's corps came up.</p>
<p>18. Harper's Ferry (Sept. 14, 15). When General Lee went into
Maryland he detached several batteries of artillery, with sufficient
troops to guard them, and had them secretly posted upon the Loudon
Heights, opposite the Shenandoah side of Harper's Ferry, and on the
Maryland Heights, on the Potomac side. About the time that these
batteries were getting into position Jackson diverged from the road
from Boonsboro' to Hagerstown, which General Lee took, and pursued the
road leading to a ford over the Potomac River at Williamsport. His
course is indicated by fig. 4 and arrows. By this means he drove a
large force of Federals out of Martinsburg and followed them to
Harper's Ferry. Having then invested the place, the batteries opened
on them from the Loudon Heights, and when they took refuge behind the
rocks on the other side of the hill batteries opened upon them from
the Maryland Heights, Jackson meanwhile shelling them from his
position in the rear. The place, being untenable, was surrendered,
with very large stores, artillery, muskets, &#x0026;c. About 13,000
prisoners were taken, including nearly 12,000 Federal soldiers. The
surrender of Harper's Ferry was made on Monday. That night Jackson
marched to Shepherd's-town, and on Tuesday night was on General Lee's
left at Sharpsburg, engaging in the battle which culminated on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>19. On the night of Sept. 14 General Lee withdrew his men from
South Mountain, in consequence of General M'Clellan having obtained
possession of Crampton's Gap, leading directly to Sharpsburg; and,
proceeding to the latter position, he there awaited the coming of
Jackson. General M'Clellan followed him on Monday afternoon (15th),
and General Lee stood at bay for two days on the south-west bank of
Antietam, using his artillery to delay M'Clellan's attack until Jackson
could join him. Jackson marched all night after the capture of
Harper's Ferry; and on Wednesday, the 17th, he fought a battle on the
extreme left of the Confederate lines, which were more than four miles
long.</p>
<p>General M'Clellan had three lines of battle; General Lee was
scarcely able to present a single line, which, in some places, was
not adequately supported. In addition to this, M'Clellan had a large
reserve, which was so admirably used that, when the Confederates at
any point drove in the Federal lines, which they often did, the
reserves overwhelmed them and compelled them to fall hack. The Federal
signal corps contributed to this result, by giving immediate notice to
M'Clellan of every event along the lines. In addition, there was great
disparity of numbers between the contending forces. The action lasted
from morning until dark. General A. P. Hill did not get into position
until late in the afternoon, and his men were wearied by their march
from Harper's Ferry. General Lee, finding himself short of ammunition,
forage, rations for the men, &#x0026;c., and that M'Clellan did not renew the
action on Thursday, crossed the Potomac that night. This movement was
managed with such skill that the Confederate pickets did not know the
army was gone until they were driven in after sunrise next
morning.</p>
<p>20. Shepherdstown (September 20).--On Friday there was an artillery
duel between the Confederate General Pendleton and M'Clellan, across
the Potomac River at Shepherdstown; but on the next day Jackson
directed that a few brigades of M'Clellan's army should be allowed to
cross the river, and that General A. P. Hill should then attack
them. It is impossible to estimate the immense numbers that were
slaughtered or drowned on that occasion. The river was red with blood
and disfigured with bodies for some distance. The total loss could not
have been less than 4000.</p>
<p>21. Fredericksburg (December 3).--This was the first occasion on
which General Lee had the advantage of an extended line of works. He
selected a magnificent plain about five miles long and from two to two
and a half broad, and surrounded it with abattis, rifle-pits, and
masked batteries. Into this plain the Federal army, under command of
General Burnside, ventured. Longstreet was on the left, Jackson and
Stuart on the right. The hills around the plain were in the form of a
crescent, and were each surmounted with batteries commanding the whole
plain. Had General Lee been acquainted with the extent of the Federal
losses, he would have moved from his position and completed their
destruction. As it was, he fully expected them to make another attempt
to carry his works, and General Burnside succeeded in withdrawing his
army in the night across the river. The plan of the relative position
of Lee and Burnside's armies at Fredericksburg shows them so
distinctly as to preclude the necessity of verbal description. The
plain on which the battles were fought is, it will be seen, overlooked
by the Stafford heights, on which batteries of guns of large size were
placed, and in some cases shot and shell were sent five miles across
the river and plain. There were few trees upon the plain, and
consequently the movements of the Federal troops could be seen from
the hills.</p>
<p>Stonewall Jackson had his head-quarters on a hill in rear of
Hamilton's Crossing, and nearly 500 shot and shell fell that day
within one hundred yards of where he stood. At Marye's-hill the ground
was covered for acres with killed and wounded Federals, lying in some
places two or three deep. The cross-street on this hill formed a fine
stone breastwork for the Confederates.</p>
<p>22. (March 17, l863). A cavalry engagement between a large body of
Federal cavalry (said to be 2500) and Brigadier-General Fitz-Lee (a
nephew of the Hon. J. M. Mason). The losses were heavy, but the
Federals re-crossed the Rappahannock. General Lee had only 750 men
under his command.</p>
<p>23. The Wilderness.--General Jackson, with a portion of his corps,
pursued the source indicated by fig. 5 and arrows, in order to turn
the flank of General Hooker, whose army had crossed the river and was
at Chancellorsville, and got between him and the fords and pontoons by
which alone he could re-cross the river. Had it not been for his being
wounded by his own men he would, in all probability, have compelled
Hooker to surrender or fight his way back to the river. Jackson had
only 20,000 men in the action. In consequence of his wounds, the
action defeated but did not destroy Hooker.</p>
<p>24. Marye's-hill.--General Sedgwick, with 20,000 Federal troops
(another statement makes it only 15,000), having taken possession of
the heights above Fredericksburg, and slain, captured, or scattered
the troops left in charge (supposed to be Colonel Barkesdale's
regiment), was in turn attacked by a division of General Lee's army,
and routed with great slaughter.</p>
<p>In all the above engagements, and in others of less importance, the
Federal officers and men fought with great endurance and bravery, as
must be evident when the length of time they held their ground and
their heavy losses are considered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the victories of the Confederate leaders, hardly
gained as they have been, have failed often in bringing about those
results which might fairly have been expected from them. The
overwhelming numbers of the Federal armies, their abundant supplies,
the splendid artillery at their command, and the good use made of it,
contributed, with the numerical disproportion and exhaustion of
the Confederates, their limited supplies of horses, ammunition, and
rations, to render many of the above hardly-fought and victorious
fields barren of decisive results.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">New Haven</hi> (U .S.) <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> says that a Captain Davis Hatch, of
Norfolk, Connecticut, has returned from a visit to the salt mines at
the east end of St. Domingo. He states that there is a mountain there
of pure rock salt ten miles long, one mile and a half wide, and 400
ft. high. He has obtained from the Government of St. Domingo a grant
for working the mines, and the exclusive privilege for making a
railroad from the mines to the port of Barahona, twelve miles
distant.</p></div2></div1></body>
