<p>....The prospect westerly is not so auspicious. Would that it were
in our power to foretell the certain termination of the struggle in
America before the year 1865 has closed! We can only look and sigh
over the ruin that is there running its course, and try to hope that,
when the end comes, whether this year or next, or even at some point
of time beyond them, it will bring with it some compensation, which
future generations at least may regard as commensurate with immediate
sacrifices and sufferings. It is to the West we look with most anxiety
in respect of our own international relations. The discharge of the
St. Albans raiders by Judge Coursal, upon a mere technical flaw, might
easily open the way to war between us and our transatlantic kinsmen if
the two Governments were not guided by a spirit of self-restraint
towards each other. Happily, as on the part of Canada the judgment of
its legal officer has been spontaneously repudiated, so on the part of
the United States the rash order of its military officer has been
discountenanced; and where there is a frank recognition of each others
good faith, and an evident desire on both sides to clear up accidental
misunderstandings, we need not allow our anxiety to deepen into
apprehension. Hitherto we have maintained our neutrality without
compromise, and, with it, amicable relations with Mr. Lincoln's
Government. There is ground enough in the facts of which we have
present information for regarding a rupture between the two greatest
maritime Powers in the world as a calamity which is equally and
earnestly deprecated by both, and is therefore
improbable....</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Hibernia we have news from New York to the
afternoon of Dec. 24.</p>
<p>General Hood's defeated army succeeded in crossing the Duck river,
in spite of General Thomas's hot pursuit. On the 20th ult. Hood was
joined at Columbia by Forrest; and on the 22nd he had reached Pulaski,
seventy-five miles south of Nashville, still closely pressed by the
Federal cavalry. The Federal accounts estimate Hood's losses at 17,000
men, killed, wounded and taken prisoners; and represent Thomas's
losses not to have exceeded 5000 men.</p>
<p>General Sherman reports on the 13th ult., from Ossibau Sound, that
he had captured Fort M'Allister, opened communication with the fleet,
destroyed the railroads leading to Savannah, and invested the
city. His left rested on the Savannah River, three miles above the
city, and his right on the Ogeechee River, at King's Bridge. He had an
agreeable and unmolested march. His army was in splendid order, and
amply supplied with provisions. During his march of 300 miles Sherman only
lost about 1000 men, and he arrived in front of Savannah with more
stores, provisions, and horses than he started with. About 700 negroes
joined him on the route. He destroyed 200 miles of railroad. He
estimates the garrison of Savannah, under Hardee, at 15,000, with
about 25,000 inhabitants. According to Confederate despatches "all was
well" at Savannah to the 19th ult.; and there was no further
intelligence respecting the progress of General Sherman's
operations. A letter from Admiral Dahlgren states that he is buoying
the Savannah River for an attack on the city in conjunction with other
forces.</p>
<p>The Southern journals alleged that General Breckenridge had
defeated the Federal General Burbridge, in the neighbourhood of
Saltville, in Western Virginia.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter's whole fleet was reported by a Confederate telegram
to have been in sight from Fort Fisher, near Wilmington, on the 21st
ult.; and the Confederate commander, General Bragg, added in his
despatch a confident declaration that he could hold Wilmington. It was
said that Porter's fleet had been crippled by a storm, and no
immediate attack on Wilmington was expected.</p>
<p>Advices received at New York state that the exchange of prisoners
at Charleston being ended, the bombardment of the city will be
immediately recommenced.</p>
<p>The Federal gun-boat Narcissus has been blown up by a torpedo at
Mobile.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has cancelled General Dix's order as to the pursuit of
raiders across the frontier into Canada. Some of the New York papers
complain of this. In Congress it had been moved to prepare an armed
force for the Lakes.</p>
<p>A draught of 300,000 men has been ordered. All absentees are also
ordered to rejoin their regiments immediately.</p>
<p>Secretary Fessenden is about to contract a new loan of 100,000,000
dollars.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward has ordered that persons coming to the United States,
except immigrants, must have passports. This regulation applies
specially to persons coming from the British provinces.</p>
<p>Both branches of the Federal Congress had adjourned to the 5th
inst.</p>
<p>Gold was quoted at New York, on the afternoon of the 24th ult., at
220&#x00B7;.</p>
<p>In the Southern Congress there have been some noteworthy
movements. First, a resolution has been introduced to send
commissioners to treat with Federal commissioners upon the restoration
of peace. Mr. Foote, a member of the Confederate Senate, made a
speech, in which he declared the Confederacy to be on the verge of
ruin, and blamed Jefferson Davis for all the late military
disasters. Mr. Foote afterwards withdrew from the Senate. The <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Enquirer</hi> says that General Lee is in
favour of arming the negroes. The same paper declares that if
independence can only be attained by the sacrifice of slavery that
sacrifice must be made.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Parliament is summoned to meet on the 19th inst.</p>
<p>A proclamation has been issued by the Governor-General of Canada
calling out a large force of volunteer militia to prevent raids from
Canada into the United States, and to maintain order on the
frontier. Thirty companies of Canadian volunteers have been sent to
the frontier.</p>
<p>Three of the St. Albans raiders have been recaptured. The discharge
of the raiders by Judge Coursal is condemned by both the Government
and rebel newspaper organs in Canada, and the majority of the people
appear to be indignant at the critical condition in which the
relations between the Northern States and the provinces have been
placed by it. Mr. Lamothe, the chief of the Montreal police, had
resigned, it was supposed, to avoid dismissal. The bankers and
merchants of Montreal had addressed a memorial to the Governor-General
setting forth their desire that a fair and honest neutrality should be
maintained between the belligerent States of America....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE SINKING OF THE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Confederate Steamer<lb/>Florida, In The
James<lb/>River.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> would have been disagreeable to the
national pride of the Americans if the Federal Government at
Washington, unable to answer the diplomatic remonstrances provoked by
the late violation of a neutral harbour of Brazil, had been obliged to
send back the Confederate steamer Florida, captured illegally by the
Wachusetts at Bahia on the 7th of October, and to replace their prize
where she was taken, beneath the sheltering jurisdiction of the
Brazilian sovereignty. From this mortification they have been saved,
as already reported, by the happy accident or expedient of sinking the
Florida ten fathoms under water in Hampton Roads, at the mouth of the
James River, where she was unaccountably run down by a Federal
transport-steamer, the Alliance, on the 19th of November, going to the
bottom a few hours afterwards.</p>
<p>The Illustration we now publish is from a sketch by Mr. Edward
L. Henry, of New York, who witnessed the event. The Florida is shown
as she appeared, having lost her mizenmast in the conflict with the
Wachusetts at Bahia. The ship seen to the right hand is an ironclad or
Monitor, named the Atlanta, which was stationed as a guardship at the
mouth of the river. In the distance is Newport News, with a military
camp on shore. The following account of the destruction of the Florida
is given by the correspondent of a New York paper:--</p>
<p>"On the 19th the Florida went to Norfolk to coal, and just before
starting was run into by the transport-steamer Alliance. She was was
in very bad condition when captured, and all the time since her
arrival here she has leaked so badly as to keep the steam-pump engaged
continually. The collision with the Alliance greatly increased the
volume of the water which constantly poured into her. About nine
o'clock on Sunday evening one of the pumps on board suddenly gave
out. Before more assistance arrived the water had risen considerably
above the fire-room floor, so that it was found necessary to put the
fires out. The pump-engine was thus stopped, and the water came
pouring in at a fearful rate. It was impossible at any time, after it
was found the ill-fated ship was sinking, to move her toward the
shore, as there was but 7 lb. pressure of steam--just sufficient to
work the pumps. Neither were there means at hand for towing her
ashore. In a few minutes after sending the two boats to the Florida,
Captain Woodward, of the Atlanta, came himself on<pb n="6"/> board to
see what could be done to keep her afloat. But it was apparent that
she must soon sink, and the men were ordered to save their effects and
prepare to leave her to her fate. The Florida kept rapidly filling so
that at seven o'clock the water was a foot above the berth-deck. At
the same time that Mr. Baker signalled the Atlanta he sent a
telepathic message to Admiral Porter at this place that the Florida
was sinking. The Admiral immediately ordered the tug Page to steam up
to the Florida and tow her into shoal water towards the shore. The tug
came alongside at 7.15, but the Florida was by this time so near
sinking that it was deemed dangerous to attach it, as in going down
she would take the tug along with her. A few minutes after, with eight
feet of water in her, she careened over, and disappeared stern
foremost. Mr. Baker and Captain Woodward remained alongside in the tug
until she went under. The Florida had all her guns and everything on
board just as when she was captured. There is a feeling of general
satisfaction among naval officers here at her fate. It is considered
much preferable to have her disposed of here, and then indemnity be
offered to the Brazilian Government, than suffer the humiliation of
taking her backs and seeing her saluted as she would enter the harbour
of Rio Janeiro in triumph, with the rebel flag flying. This would have
been a most bitter pill to the American officers who would have had to
accompany her."</p></div2>

<p>....But they are saying at the clubs, too, that Lord Lyons will not
return to Washington. His Lordship has but recently returned to this
country on leave of absence; but, if the sages of Pall-mall are to be
believed, he will not resume his arduous and thankless mission. He is
said to be suffering from an affection of the eyes; and, certainly,
the climate of Washington--scorching in summer and scarifyingly cold
in winter--is not favourable to the cure of affections of any
kind. But who is to replace an amiable and discreet diplomatist, who,
all things considered, has been the very best Minister we have ever
accredited to the United States? Washington might be an agreeable
change from Madrid to Sir John Crampton; but, alas! Sir John knows the
District of Columbia but too well. Did not our cousin turn him out of
it and out of the country to boot, ten years ago? Lord Napier; too,
has been promoted; but were it possible to take him from
St. Petersburg, his return to America would eminently please the
Northerners, among whom his frank and cordial manners have made him
exceedingly popular....</p></div2>

<p>....The opening paper in <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi>, "President
Lincoln," by an American Abolitionist (Mr. Conway, we imagine), is
remarkable as a manifesto from that small but earnest band whose
triumphant contest in the name of principle against oppression,
supported by the entire strength of a mighty nation, forms as
remarkable and as encouraging a chapter in the history of the world as
the Reformation itself. We fear, however, that it is plain, on the
writer's own showing, that the Abolitionist leaders were incompetent
to carry out the movement they had so nobly inaugurated. An erroneous
fallacy pervades his essay, he fancies that he and his friends
represent the sense of the American people, and talks as though the
chief magistrate of the nation were bound to make himself the mere
instrument of a bare majority of the people of Massachusetts. Had
Mr. Lincoln done so, he and Massachusetts and the negro would long ago
have been swept away together in a tempest of popular wrath, and his
caution has been the salvation of the very men by whom he is so
fiercely denounced. He has been to Garrison and Phillips what Peel was
to Cobden, or Cavour to Mazzini--a practical, worldly wise man,
standing on a far lower moral level, but without whom lofty principles
and ardent imaginations would never have appeared in the guise of
realities....</p>
<p>This month's <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> witnesses the
conclusion of "Tony Butler," which has not wholly redeemed the promise
of its commencement, but is still entitled to the praise of an
interesting, animated tale. "The Man and the Monkey" is a most amusing
story, of a kind almost peculiar to <hi
rend="italic">Blackwood</hi>. "Cornelius O'Dowd" writes with sense and
point, except when treating of America, when his remarks betray great
flippancy and ignorance. The English officer's account of his visit to
the Confederate States is more satisfactory, though it is impossible
to repress a groan over the stupidity which could turn such splendid
opportunities to such poor account. However, we must take him as he
is, and be thankful. Charleston and the Chattanooga campaign are the
subjects of his present instalment. With characteristic infelicity he
managed to arrive at General Bragg' head-quarters just too late for
the battle of Chicamauga, and to quit them just before that of
Missionary Ridge....</p></div2>

<p>The seal of the Confederate States of America, the composition of
which is by J. H. Foley, R. A., contains as a centre a representation
of that statue of Washington which was executed by the American
sculptor, Crawford, and erected at Richmond. The figure is mounted and
in uniform, as commanding in an engagement. It is surrounded by a
wreath beautifully composed of the most valuable vegetable products of
the Southern soil, as tobacco, rice, maize, cotton, wheat, and
sugar-cane. The rim bears the legend, "The Confederate States of
America, 22nd February, 1862. Deo Vindice." The seal is of silver, and
its diameter is from three to four inches.</p>

contained money, deeds, bills of exchange, draughts, cheques,
jewellery, and other valuables. Some of them were misdirected, others
not directed at all, other, unstamped, and others only partially
directed. Thousands of these dead letters were returned to the
writers, but the great majority had to be destroyed.</p></div2>

<p>By the Peruvian we have news from New York to the evening of
Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Savannah has fallen into the hands of the Federals. General Sherman
thus pithily notifies the welcome fact to President Lincoln:--</p>
<p rend="right">Savannah, Georgia, Dec. 22.</p>
<p>I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah, with
150 heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about 25,000 bales
of cotton.</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">W. J. Sherman</hi>,
Major-General.</p>
<p>General Sherman occupied the city on the morning of the 21st ult.,
and found the 20,000 inhabitants, he says, "quiet and well disposed."
The Confederate General Hardee had previously rejected a summons to
surrender; but during the 20th ult. he succeeded in transporting all
his infantry and field artillery across the river from the city to a
place called Union Causeway, and had thus escaped the assault which
the Federals intended to make, and withdrawn his troops before the
Federal works had advanced enough to impede his passage of the
river. Savannah advices of the 26th ult. report that an effort was
being made to intercept General Hardee's retreat before he could reach
the Broad River; but the Richmond journals stated that General Hardee
had arrived at Charleston.</p>
<p>As a set-off against the Federal success at Savannah, we have to
record the failure of the Federal attack on Wilmington. General Butler
had returned to Fort Monroe, and the transports with his troops on
board were also arriving there. Admiral Porter, with his frigates and
monitors, had proceeded to Beaufort, and was there awaiting further
orders. Admiral Porter, in his report of the operations, stated that
on the 24th ult., after a large powder-ship had been blown up under
the walls of Fort Fisher, without doing any damage, his fleet
bombarded the fort, and in an hour silenced the Confederate fire. On
the afternoon of the 25th 8000 troops, under the command of General
Weitzel, landed under cover of the fire from the fleet, captured two
batteries, and advanced within fifty yards of Fort Fisher, some of the
men even entering the outworks. General Weitzel, however, deemed a
successful attack impracticable, and reembarked on the same evening,
though about 1000 men remained ashore during the following day, in
consequence of the state of the weather. General Butler informed
Admiral Porter, on the night of the 25th ult., that an assault was
impracticable, as Fort Fisher was substantially uninjured as a
defensive work by the navy fire, and could only be reduced by a
regular siege; and he added that he should return to Fort Monroe as
soon as the transports for his troops were ready. Admiral Porter
vainly assured General Butler that the fire of his ships could keep
the Confederates inside the fort from showing their heads until a
storming column should be within twenty yards of the works, and that
the capture of the fort by assault, if attempted, would have been
easier than was supposed. An interesting feature in Admiral Porter's
report is his condemnation of the 100-pounder Parrott guns, which he
says were unfit for the service. Six of them burst, killing and
wounding forty-five men.</p>
<p>The notion of the powder-ship which, as stated above, was blown up
near Fort Fisher with such trivial result, was suggested by the
effect of the explosion at Erith; and the method of fitting out and
firing the vessel is thus described:--</p>
<q><p>The United States steam gun-boat Louisiana was taken to the
Norfolk Navy yard about a month ago, and such changes made in her as
would adapt her to receive the powder. She was also disguised as much
as possible, so as to give her the appearance of a
blockade-runner. After all the required changes had been made the
Louisiana was towed to Craney Island, where she was loaded. The hold
was left empty, as the powder at the explosion was desired to be as
much as possible above water. The powder was contained in a bulkhead
occupying a portion of the berth-deck and extending nearly to the
boilers. the first tier of powder was placed in the barrels with the
heads taken out, and the remainder was in bags. For the purpose of
exploding the powder, there were three clock-fuses placed in the
vessel, one in each gangway and one aft, near the boilers. From each
of these a patent Gomez fuse led completely round the vessel, and
terminated one in the hold and the others in the centre of the
berth-deck. Any one of the fuses ignited would fire all the others,
because each one crossed one of the others, and wherever they crossed
they were grafted. There were no absolute soundings of the shore in
the vicinity of Fort Fisher, and it was only a matter of conjecture
how near the Louisiana could go before she ran aground. When her
bottom first grated the sand her furnace-doors were to be thrown open,
the engines left running, and caps placed upon the fuses, the clocks
set, and everybody hurriedly transferred to the picket launch, the
tug, and the boats. The explosion was expected to take place in
thirty or forty minutes, and by that time the party, with their
steam-launch, would probably be five miles away. A provision was made,
however, in case something should occur--some accident befall the
launch. Under such circumstances they were to take the surf-boat and
row for life till<pb n="27"/> the time for the explosion, when they
were to jump overboard, go with ropes and buoys as far as possible
from the boat, submerge to the head, and, with cotton in their ears,
await the shock.</p></q>
<p>The Federals have been again repulsed in an attempt to land on
Roanoke Island; and an expedition by Granger against Mobile had,
according to Confederate accounts, been driven back.</p>
<p>There are contradictory reports as to Hood's movement. One account
says that he had crossed the Tennessee. Another states that the
Federal gun-boats had prevented him from crossing, and even adds that
the remnant of his army had been captured.</p>
<p>Although it was declared that the Federal Generals Stoneman and
Burbridge had been defeated in Western Virginia, it seems that they
have captured Saltville, the great manufactory of salt for the
South.</p>
<p>At Richmond there has been no new movement, but it was reported
that Lee was preparing to attack the Federals. The Southern press urge
Lee's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the
Confederacy.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has been made an LL.D. by the College of New
Jersey.</p>
<p>The President has remitted the sentence of the court-martial upon
Admiral Wilkes to a period of one year from its date. The sentence
suspended him three years from the service.</p>
<p>The Brazilian demand for explanation and reparation for the
seizure of the Florida has been replied to by a note from
Mr. Seward. Regret is expressed for the proceeding at Bahia. Captain
Collins is suspended and ordered to be tried by court-martial. The
United States Consul at Bahia is dismissed, and the men captured in
the Florida are to be set at liberty. Mr. Seward says the United
States have a complaint against Brazil for recognising the
Confederates as belligerents, but he adds that it is no part of the
duty of an officer to take upon himself the redressing of his
country's wrongs.</p>
<p>President Jefferson Davis has issued a declaration that
B. G. Burley--who has been apprehended in Canada, and who headed the
men who endeavoured to take the steamer Michigan on Lake Erie and then
release the Confederate prisoners on Johnson's island--is a
Confederate officer, and acted under the authority of the Confederate
Government.</p>
<p>The esteemed veteran English actor, Mr. James William Wallack--a
contemporary of Edmund Keen and Elliston--died at New York on
Christmas Day, aged sixty-nine, having been born in London in 1795. He
made his first appearance in America at the Park Theatre, New York, in
1818, and his great success and popularity with the play-going public
of that city induced him to divide his time thenceforth between
England and the United States. In 1836 he opened the National Theatre,
New York, and remained manager of it until it was destroyed by fire,
in 1839. He then returned to England, and played for some time at the
Princess's Theatre. In 1851 he once more crossed the Atlantic, with
the intention of residing permanently in America. The New York papers
record his decease with strong expressions of sympathy and regret.</p>
<p>The steam-ship North America foundered while on her voyage from New
Orleans to New York. She had on board 203 sick soldiers, twelve cabin
passengers, and a crew of forty-four men. Of these only sixty-two
persons were saved. Among the lost were Colonel Saunders and
Lieutenant-Colonel Horn.</p>

<p>The Governor of Canada issued a proclamation offering a reward of
200 dollars for the apprehension of each of the St. Albans

sent for examination to Montreal. Their trial began on the 27th ult.,
in the Superior Court, before Mr. Justice Smith. It was stated that
three of the raiders had made their way into the United States, and
had enlisted into the Federal service in New Hampshire, but had been

<p>"From Erith to Wilmington." The quiet little village, on the right
bank of the Thames, with its interesting old church and sundial
thereon, its yacht proclivities, and its water-side population, who
seem to get their living by leaning, in a long row, against the wooden
rails and, abusing one another in some dialect of Kent, was awfully
astonished on the morning when the powder blew up, by nobody's fault,
and in a second converted a scene of orderly industry into a hideous
ruin. But it must be almost as much astounded to learn that the story
of that explosion, having found its way across the Atlantic, set<pb
n="31"/> the Federal Admiral Porter upon a scheme for reducing a
strong Confederate fortress. Such, it appears, was the case; the ruin
wrought by that Erith catastrophe would, it was hoped, be paralleled
at Fort Fisher. Every clever precaution was taken to ensure success. A
tremendous quantity of powder was stowed on board a ship, and the most
ingenious system of clockwork was devised to fire the train at the
right moment. A grand expedition sailed against Wilmington, bearing
this floating mine with it, and in due course, and under favourable
circumstances, the powder-vessel was moored at the spot which had been
judged the best. Brave men fixed her at her moorings, set the terrible
clocks going, and escaped. The expedition watched with bated breath
for the eruption of the volcano. The clocks were faithful,</p>
<p rend="center">The nitre fired, and, while the dreadful
sound;<lb/>Responsive shook the yielding air around,</p>
<p>the assailants' hearts beat high; and, as the smoke cleared, the
Federals hoped to see a ruin where Fort Fisher had been. "The shock
was nothing like so severe as was expected," writes the frank sailor;
"it shook the vessel <hi rend="italic">some</hi>, broke one or two
glasses, but nothing more." Wilmington is luckier than Erith. However,
Admiral Porter, with a fine squadron, was not the man to be satisfied
with one failure. The experiment had been fruitless; but he had his
guns, and plenty of them, and he brought up his ironclads, and
commenced a fierce bombardment, which he describes, in the language of
the defender of Sebastopol, as a <hi rend="italic">feu
d'enfer</hi>. It silenced several of the fort batteries, blew up two
magazines, and set the place on fire. But there was delay in bringing
on the troops for the assault; and when it was effected the assailants
found that they could not succeed. When 3000 men had landed, the
Admiral was informed that they were re-embarking. Some brave feats
were performed, but General Butler did not see his way to storm. The
Admiral was clearly disgusted. He uses the ordinary civil language
towards a brother officer, and is certain that the latter had good
reasons for his conduct, but the gallant Porter thinks that it "would
have been worth while to make the attempt after coming so far." But
then he is only a smart sailor, while Butler, who has been an
attorney, may have known better when to issue his <hi
rend="italic">nolle prosequi</hi>. Finally, the attack was given up,
the expedition returned to head-quarters, and Wilmington is safe and
defiant.</p>
<p>This is an item which the Confederates are proud to set against the
series of Federal successes that marked the close of the year. They
have fairly beaten off one of the most formidable squadrons ever sent
against a fortress, and have been able to laugh at the failure of a
new and terrific-seeming engine of war. They gain nothing, it is true;
while Atlanta has been destroyed, and Savannah has been captured; but
they have saved a far more important port than either, and may
reasonably be exultant.</p>
<p>As regards the state of the war generally, at the opening of 1865,
we have less reason to be ashamed of stating that it is impossible for
people here to form a decided opinion, inasmuch as it is clear that
neither North nor South has an exact knowledge of the case. Sherman's
brilliant retreat, or march, has proved this. The Americans do not
know their own country. No one in the Federal district would speak
confidently of the probable success of Sherman; but those who did
attempt to demonstrate the truth were all wrong. They thought that he
was to pass through a poor and needy country; and so sincere was their
pity for the hardships he was to undergo that the most compassionate
articles were written upon the state of his army, and a painful
contrast was drawn between the meagre Christmas fare of his troops and
the ample comforts provided for the grand army of the Potomac. The
truth turned out to be that Sherman's men were marching through a rich
agricultural region, had the best food, never wanted a meal, and
arrived at Savannah in the highest health and strength. The Northern
writers now admit that folk generally did not know the resources of
Georgia. The truth is that the masses in America, with all their real
sharpness and all their flood of cheap newspapers, are very ignorant
about most things; and smart as is their talk, its chief cleverness is
that it covers a singular absence of exact knowledge. But, on the
other hand, the Confederates seem to have been equally uncertain as to
what Sherman could or could not do. His able feints at Macon and
Augusta no doubt bewildered them; but they must have known, one might
suppose, whether he could be encountered at all; and yet the most
opposite statements on the subject proceeded from the Richmond
papers. They know now that he marched all the way in triumph, his main
body scarcely hearing a cannon, his detachments burning and laying
waste, his whole force feeding on the fat of the land, and the negroes
crowding to his ranks, and having to be sent away sometimes by
force. But until the event had occurred neither South nor North could
give solid reasons for its anticipations. It is hardly to be expected
that English readers, even with the beautiful maps published under
Federal authority, should know more; although we have some idea that
our military men, with those charts before them, arrive at sounder
judgments than many folk in America, and that some of our journalists
give far more complete and truthful details than we find in the
Northern or the Southern press. But, so far as we can venture on a
decision, we must say that the enormous resources of the North are now
telling distressingly upon its antagonist, and that the admitted want
of men in the South, evidenced, too, by the renewed proposal to arm
the negroes, seems to point towards a crisis. The splendid valour
which the Confederates have displayed is unabated, and must not only
command respect in Europe, but in the North, and, with a generous
enemy, will certainly improve the terms on which the two parties will
soon, we trust, confer. Our own Foreign Secretary has said that,
though we are strictly neutral, the subjugation of the South would be
an injury to the cause of humanity, and we trust that both the word
and the idea will be alike discarded. The moment is not inopportune
for the discussion of an honourable peace, which must be obtained by
mutual concessions; and it could be wished that some Nestor could step
in between the transatlantic Ajax and Ulysses, and say,</p>
<p rend="center">"Forbear, my sons, your further might to
prove.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE TOWN AND PORT OF SAVANNAH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> town and port of Savannah, which
General Sherman has captured without a siege, by the retirement of the
Confederate General Hardee, whose forces were unable to defend the
place, is situated on the right bank of the River Savannah, eighteen
miles from the sea. It is the terminus of three railroads connecting
it with the neighbouring States of Alabama, Tennessee, and South
Carolina. The Savannah river, indeed, marks the frontier between South
Carolina and the State of Georgia, to which the town or city of
Savannah belongs. The population was, previously to the war, about
25,000, and the place was a thriving mart for cotton, rice and lumber,
but especially for the Sea-Island cotton, the most valuable kind, that
is grown, produced nowhere except in the low lands along this
coast. The harbour is good, there being from 18 ft. to 21 ft. of water
at low-tide over the bar at the mouth of the river, while vessels
drawing 13 ft. can get up to the wharves of the town, and those
drawing 15 ft. or 16 ft. may go as far as Five-fathom Hole, three
miles below the town. There is steam navigation up the river to
Augusta, a distance of 140 miles. The town itself stands upon a sandy
flat, about 40 ft. above the water. It is laid out with great
regularity, in spacious streets and squares, crossing each other at
right angles; the streets are lined with a double row of trees, and
the squares have inclosed gardens in the centre, like those of
London. There are fourteen or fifteen churches, one of which, the
Independent Presbyterian, is an elegant and costly structure of
granite; a Jewish synagogue, an academy, a courthouse, gaol, exchange,
barracks, arsenal, theatre, market-house, and various charitable
institutions. The accompanying Map or Plan will give some idea of the
capabilities of the place for military fortification.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> explosion of fifty-five tons of
gunpowder sufficed to frighten Erith out of its wits, shake Woolwich to
its foundations, and knock a considerable portion of the Thames
embankment into what is termed, in Hibernian parlance, "smithereens."
But 215 tons of powder exploded by the Federals under the lee of a
fort at Wilmington seem to have made no more impression on its walls
than the hundred plum buns full of calomel and prussic acid made on
Chunee, the mad elephant, at Exeter Change. Our cousins seem
unfortunate in their blow-ups. What a disastrous failure was the
springing of that mine before Petersburg last August! The
superstitious among the warriors of the great armada, which is said to
have returned to Fortress Monroe, may ascribe the failure of the
expedition to the presence of General Butler in a position of high
command. Jonah should have been cast overboard. But many of those who
are not superstitious might feel inclined to augur that no success
could attend an enterprise which was conducted on a Sunday and on
Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The veteran James Wallack is dead. Not many weeks have elapsed
since we saw him in his little bijou of a house in New York,
surrounded by the portraits of Macready, and Younge, and Kemble, with
his stalwart son Lester by his side, and a little grandson on his
knee, looking as handsome, and as dignified as of yore, and full of
his old humour, vivacity, and grace. He had been for many years a
cruel sufferer from the most atrocious form of rheumatic gout;
chalkstones exuded from him like drops of blood; his limbs were all
swathed in silken bandages; but at seventy years of age, and all but
bedridden, there were still in his eye and in his voice the vigour and
cheeriness of a young man. It was no wreck you saw before you. The
gallant and chivalrous Don C&#x00E6;sar, the dashing Massaroni, the
audacious Monseigneur, could still be recognised.</p>
<p>James W. Wallack was something more than a brilliant and versatile
actor. He was a high-minded and accomplished English gentleman. In his
own country the noblest in the land were glad to associate with him,
and more than one of his sons and nephews held commissions in the
British Army. He was the proprietor of the most charming theatre in
New York--a theatre wherein good English plays are performed by good
English actors, and had realised, we believe, a handsome fortune. His
son Lester, who is a great favourite as an actor in light comedy with
the New York public, and who is married to a sister of Mr. Millais,
the Academician, will, we presume, succeed to the management of
Wallack's Theatre. Some of the best traditions of the English stage in
its best days die with James W. Wallack....</p>
<p>We rarely allude to matters personal to ourselves; but there is an
acme of ill-treatment at which even the most patient camel will
groan. Among the multifarious publications of a Mr. Beeton we perceive
that there is a magazine specially devised for the delectation of
young ladies. We notice that Mr. Beeton, or Mr. Beeton's editor, has
chosen to appropriate two lengthy extracts from the series of papers
entitled "America in the Midst of War," written by the writer of these
"Echoes," and to publish them in his magazine as distinct articles,
appending to them the author's name. This is the more unseemly, as in
the whole course of our life we never wrote a line for Mr. Beeton. The
whole proceeding is exceedingly untradesmanlike. Every bookseller in
London knows that the experiences of the author of "America in the
Midst of War" are about to be published in book form; and had
Mr. Beeton's magazine been published in February instead of January,
an injunction in the Court of Chancery would very soon have taught him
the difference between <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi
rend="italic">tuum</hi>. Editorial scissors are excellent things, but
they are ill employed in taking the bread out of a labouring man's
mouth.</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Saxonia and the City of Manchester we have
intelligence from New York to the 7th inst.</p>
<p>Everything was quiet at Savannah, and good order prevailed among
the citizens. General Sherman is reported to be in occupation of both
banks of the Savannah. It is believed that his next point of attack
will be Branchville, where the Charleston and Savannah Railroad meets
the Augusta road. The Confederates are preparing to defend this
important position. The military authorities of Charleston have shown
their sense of the near neighbourhood of Sherman by issuing an order
making it imperative on all slaves, not having permission to remain, to
quit the city, and interdicting entrance to the city to all
non-combatants not having proper passes. At the same time the
engineers have set to work on the land defences of the place.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter appears to have withdrawn from Wilmington. General
Bragg reports the Confederate losses during the bombardment as three
killed and fifty-five wounded. Two guns in Fort Fisher burst, two were
dismounted by the Confederates, and two by the Federal fire. Southern
despatches contain a report that the Federals had five vessels sunk
and fifteen disabled, and lost all their horses in the gale off
Wilmington.</p>
<p>It appears that the Federals were to be supported in their attack
on Wilmington by a gun-boat expedition up the Roanoke River. According
to Southern advices, this expedition met with a disaster. Six
gun-boats were blown up by torpedoes and 1000 men were lost.</p>
<p>General Hood's whole army succeeded in crossing the Tennessee
River, and his head-quarters were at Corinth, whence he had reported
that his troops had sustained no material losses since his defeat near
Nashville. The Richmond papers publish a story of the capture by Hood
of a Federal brigade after his retreat from Nashville; but Hood; in
his despatch, says nothing of such capture.</p>
<p>The only news of importance from before Richmond is the failure of
Butler's Dutch Gap canal. An attempt was made to open it on the 1st
inst., when the earth fell in and closed the channel.</p>
<p>Guerrillas are becoming numerous and troublesome on the Potomac. It
is reported that Mosby is rapidly recovering from his wounds, and will
soon be again in the saddle. [We give on page 56 an Illustration, from
a sketch by our Special Artist, of a rendezvous of Mosby's men in a
pass of the Blue Ridge.] No important military operations in the
valley of the Shenandoah are reported, but the movements of the
Confederates in that region are said to be mysterious. Federal cavalry
is scouring the Loudon valley.</p>
<p>On the 24th ult. a force of about 2500 Confederates, under General
Wirt Adams, was threatening Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>
<p>A special despatch from Cairo states that General Dona's raid on
the Mobile and Ohio Railroad was successful. Twenty-five bridges were
burnt, and 4000 carbines, a large amount of ammunition, and 300 army
waggons captured. Many officers and men were taken prisoners, and
thirty-two railway cars destroyed.</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton had left Washington for Fort Monroe, Hilton Head,
and Savannah, in order to confer personally with Generals Grant,
Foster, and Sherman.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that the Confederate Congress has secretly given
power to the Commander-in-Chief to detail 50,000 slaves for service in
the army as soldiers. Richmond papers continue to urge the Confederate
Congress to appoint General Lee Commander-in-Chief of all the
Confederate forces.</p>
<p>New-Year's Day falling on Sunday, the usual New-Year's holiday was
observed on Monday the 2nd. At Washington, the President's mansion was
freely thrown open, as is customary, and large crowds attended to pay
their respects. Among those present were all the foreign
Ambassadors.</p>
<p>The message of the Governor of New York to the Legislature
recommends a vigorous support of the war for the Union. the new
Governor calls upon the citizens to fill up their quota of the
draught.</p>
<p>In the Federal Senate, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, presented a
petition from officers of the army and navy asking for increased
compensation. Mr. Sumner presented a petition from coloured citizens
of New York asking for the abolition of slavery in the United
States. The Senate passed a vote of thanks to General Sherman and his
army. In the House of Representatives, the joint resolution to abolish
slavery by Constitutional amendment was debated without result.</p>
<p>Admiral Farragut has received a present of 50,000 dols. from the
merchants and people of New York.</p>
<p>The Hon. George Miffin Dallas, ex-Vice-President of the United
States, and more recently Minister to the Court of St. James's, died,
at his residence, in Philadelphia, on Saturday morning, Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Four persons were recently killed, and fifteen or twenty wounded,
by the breaking through the bridge at Hudson, Ohio, of a
passenger-train on the Pittsburg and Cleveland Railroad.</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden is nominated Senator from Maine, and the Treasury
portfolio is virtually vacant.</p>
<p>The latest quotation of gold at New York was about 127 per cent
premium.</p>
<p>The Olustee made her escape from Wilmington on the night of Dec. 25
while the fleet was engaged in the attack on Fort Fisher. On the
following day she was chased by the United States gun-boat Lilian, but
finally turned upon her pursuer; and the Lilian, having only two guns
against five carried by the privateer, was forced to seek safety in
flight. The Olustee pursued for some distance, but the Lilian
escaped.</p>
<p>The Shenandoah has burnt several more American
merchant-ships.</p></div2>

<p>....We met the other day a gentleman who has made several millions
sterling by American blockade-running, and who spoke of one of his
cunning Flying Dutchmen craft as having "gone to resume her career of
usefulness." A new blockade-runner has just had her career cut
lamentably short in the Mersey, breaking her back close to the
north-west light-ship and going to pieces almost instanter. A
life-boat which put off to rescue her crew capsized by the violence of
the waves, and nearly all her gallant boatmen were drowned. We read
that they were unprovided with life-belts, which, according to the
rules of the service, they should have worn....</p>
<p>Mr. John Camden Hotten, whose curious volume on "The History of
Playing-cards" contains a very droll sketch of a pack supposed to have
been designed by the late Count d'Orsay, is about to give us an
English edition of the famous work of American humour called "Artemus
Ward his Book." Three or four years have passed since in this Journal
we used to notice occasionally a little comic paper at New York called
<hi rend="italic">Vanity Fair</hi>. To this paper (which was
short-lived) Charles H. Browne, whose pseudonym is "Artemus Ward," was
the chief contributor. The "Book" itself is an exquisite piece of
drollery. Artemus Ward is supposed to be a wild beast showman,
traveling through the States and commenting upon men and manners as he
goes along. His apocryphal narrative of a visit to the Prince of
Wales in Canada is inimitably funny.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">WINTER SKETCHES IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Correspondent</hi> in New York, to whose
pencil we owe the Illustrations of skating and sleighing in that city,
writes as follows:--</p>
<p>"A few days before Christmas we had a heavy snowstorm here, which
brought out the sleighs and made things look seasonable. Some of the
omnibus proprietors laid up their wheeled vehicles for the time,
substituting for them immense concerns on runners, drawn by six
horses, and capable of holding some forty persons each when closely
packed. I send herewith a sketch of one of these
omnibus-sleighs. Their occupation is a transient and uncertain one in
New York and, even as I write, the snow has quite disappeared, and mud
is the order of things once more.</p>
<p>"The brief spell of cold weather also brought out the skaters in
great force. For two or three nights many thousands of persons
enjoyed the sports of the ice in Central Park, the lakes and ponds of
which favourite place of resort were in excellent condition. The scene
at night, on such occasions, is very striking. Powerful burners are
placed so as to illuminate the whole surface, and the light from these
is reflected with great splendour by the clear ice. I send herewith a
sketch of one of these night scenes. The buildings on the further
shore of the lake contain accommodation for the skaters. There are
refreshment-rooms, a cloak-room, and another room where skates are
let out on hire. Here there is a long counter, behind which a great
array of skates of every description is displayed upon the
wall. Groups of persons are always collected round the great stove,
which is a feature of all public rooms in New York. Numbers of young
girls, attended by their beaus, are to be seen here, as skating has
become quite the fashion since the opening of Central Park, some four
or five years ago. The last day I visited the place I noticed in the
group around the stove a very respectable looking negro woman, dressed
in rather an expensive set of furs. She had with her two small boys of
colour, whom I afterwards saw wheeling about on their skates with
great glee. The policeman in the sketch is one of the park-keepers,
who are picked from the metropolitan police, and are remarkably fine,
soldierly-looking fellows, dressed in a very becoming, light-grey
uniform. The Americans are a progressive people. I observed that some
of the boys here who assist skaters in putting on their irons have
discarded the time-honoured gimlet, so long and favourably known in
connection with skates; using instead of it a bit and
brace."</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> capture of Atlanta in October last,
followed by the march across Georgia to the seacoast, and recently, by
the capture of Savannah, has made General Sherman one of the most
notable officers in the Federal army. We give a Portrait of him and,
on the next page, a Map of his route from Atlanta to Savannah. William
T. Sherman was born in Ohio, in the year 1818. He entered, when young,
the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated
in the same class with General Thomas and then obtained his Ensign's
commission. He was promoted to a lieutenancy in 1841; and his conduct
during the Mexican war in California won him the rank of Captain. Upon
the outbreak of the civil war in 1861, he had a fresh opportunity of
active service, being appointed Colonel of the 13th Regiment of
infantry, which he commanded at the Battle of Bull Run. He was soon
afterwards raised to the rank of Brigadier-General and succeeded
General Anderson in command of the department of Ohio, from which,
however, he was removed because of a difference of opinion between
himself and the War Department as to the amount of forces required in
the Western States. At the Battle of Shiloh he took so prominent a
part that General Halleck reported the victory to be mainly due to
Sherman. He was therefore promoted to be Major-General and intrusted
with the command of the fifth division of Grant's army, with which he
was engaged in the siege of Vicksburg. During the last twelvemonth
General Sherman has performed those important operations in the States
of Tennessee and Georgia which have made his reputation second to none
in the military service of the Federal Government.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL SHERMAN'S MARCH THROUGH GEORGIA.</p>
<p>The map of General Sherman's route from Atlanta to Savannah, which
is engraved on this page, requires but little explanation. It will be
perceived that the central region of the State of Georgia, an upland
country, open and well-watered, fertile of wheat, cotton, and Indian
corn, is traversed by two railroads, from south-east to north-west,
converging at Atlanta, but running for some distance parallel to each
other, and forming the chief link of railway connection between
Virginia and the States of Alabama and Mississippi, now the south-west
limit of the Confederacy. One of these railroads is the Georgia
Central, running from Savannah to Macon, 190 miles, thence to Atlanta,
by the Macon and Western Railroad, 101 miles, making the total
distance from Savannah to Atlanta by railroad 291 miles. The other is
the Georgia Railroad running tram Augusta to Atlanta, at from forty to
sixty miles north of the Georgia Central Railroad, and making the
distance to Atlanta from Augusta 171 miles. The plan of General
Sherman's march contemplated the covering of these two lines of
railroad, their subsequent destruction, and a concentration of his
forces at or beyond Milledgeville, with Kilpatrick's cavalry force well
disposed in front, and vigilantly covering each flank. The movement
and route of his infantry columns were so well masked that, from first
to last, the enemy were in total ignorance of the position of his main
body, and only discovered the track of his infantry columns after they
had left their vigilant foes many miles to the rear. This strategic
deception was aided by a feigned approach to Macon with the cavalry of
his right wing, which completely occupied the attention of the
Confederate General Cobb, whose militia, collected at that point,
were the only forces from which General Sherman could expect any
opposition. It was on the 12th of November that the right wing of the
Federal army, under General Howard, moved out from Atlanta and began
its march, proceeding southward on the way to Macon, and then turning
eastward, while the cavalry harassed and provoked the Confederates
within a few miles of that town. Meanwhile, on the 14th of November,
the Federal left wing, under General Slocum, set forth from Atlanta,
moving almost directly east, through Covington and Oxford to Madison,
thence turning southward to the rendezvous at Milledgeville. On the
same day General Sherman himself, with his own Staff, took the road to
Macon, so as to come up with General Howard. The crossing of the River
Ocmulgee was the first step which indicated that he would pass by
Macon without attacking that town; and if the Confederates had been
aware of this intention, they might have been prepared to interrupt
his passage here; but on that very day, Nov. 20, the Federal cavalry
were at Griswoldville, only eight miles from Macon, cutting up the
railroad and telegraph, burning a foundry, and doing other
mischief. Hence the Georgia militia, under Cobb and Phillips, were
induced to stand on the defensive at Macon; and it was not until the
22nd, when Sherman was already at Milledgeville, that they made an
assault upon his rear-guard, which was merely a skirmish without
result, though it cost them 600 killed and wounded. The right and left
wings of the Federal army, having destroyed the railroads and the
public buildings of every town through which they passed, even to the
Methodist college at Oxford, with its fine library and museum, came to
a junction at Milledgeville, and remained three days in that city,
where the State Legislature had been holding its session a few days
before. On the 24th General Sherman left Milledgeville, dividing his
army as before; and it marched, by the routes shown in our Map for
each wing respectively, to Millen, a distance of seventy-five miles,
in eight days, obtaining vast quantities of forage and much cattle,
especially in the neighbourhood of Sparta, in Hancock County. The
active movements of the cavalry, under Kilpatrick, contributed greatly
to deceive the enemy as to the position of the Federal army. It was
necessary to conceal the real direction of the march; for had Wheeler,
who commanded the Confederates in this district, known in time that
Augusta was certainly to be avoided, the entire force there could have
been sent down to Millen and, being thus thrown in Sherman's front,
would have resisted or delayed his march upon Savannah, and supplied
in the end a formidable addition to the garrison of that
place. Kilpatrick, therefore, pressed Wheeler more vigorously than
ever, and the latter fell back towards Augusta, which put him out of
Sherman's way most effectually, again leaving him in the rear of the
very army whose advance he was endeavouring to resist. The remainder
of Sherman's march was from Millen to Savannah, a distance of
seventy-nine miles. By the 10th of December he had arrived within five
miles of that city, but, with sound military judgment, he made
preparations at once, not for an assault upon Savannah, but for the
capture of Fort M'Allister, thereby opening the Ogeechee River,
communicating with the fleet, and making a water base on that river at
any point he chose, directly in the rear of Savannah; and also cutting
off all communication between Savannah and the southern part of the
State, vi&#x00E2; the Savannah, Albany, and Gulf Railroad, which has
heretofore been an important avenue of supplies to the rebels, from
the vast numbers of beef-cattle from Florida transported over
it. Accordingly, a division of troops from the 14th Corps, under
General Hazen, was sent down on the 13th, and the fort was gallantly
carried by assault, with its entire garrison and stores. This rendered
the situation of the army perfectly secure. The lines were stretched
across the peninsula in the rear of Savannah, the left resting firmly
on the Savannah River, about three miles above the city, and the
extreme right on the Ogeechee river, at Kingsbridge. Having cut off
all the roads leading to Savannah and obtained command of the Savannah
and Ogeechee rivers, he had made it impossible for General Hardee to
hold the city, which was consequently abandoned by the Confederate
General and taken possession of by Sherman in time to present it to
Mr. Lincoln "as a Christmas-box."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">RENDEZVOUS OF MOSBY'S MEN IN THE PASS OF THE<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">Blue Ridge, Shenandoah Valley.</hi></p>
<p>Our Special Artist and Correspondent now at the head-quarters of
General Lee, in Virginia, has sent us a sketch representing a
night-scene which he lately witnessed in his excursion up the
Shenandoah Valley--the rendezvous of Colonel Mosby's corps of
irregular cavalry in a pass of the Blue Ridge Mountains. But we may
leave our Correspondent to describe this subject himself:--"During my
late visit to the valley of the Shenandoah with Kershaw's division, I
was fortunate enough to fall in with Mosby and a party of his famous
band. Though I found it extremely difficult to meet with this renowned
partisan chieftain, there are those amongst the Federals who find him
when they least expect and much less desire it. Your<pb n="67"/>
readers, no doubt, have frequently read paragraphs from the American
war news mentioning that Mosby had made another swoop from the
mountains of the Blue Ridge, capturing a Yankee supply-train and its
escort. To my mind he is the most astonishing guerrilla leader in the
Confederacy; and the tales one hears of him sound more like the
romance of war than the reality; but when it is considered how few men
he usually attacks with, his achievements are perfectly
marvellous. With comparatively a handful of troopers, he does not
hesitate to dash on a train of two or three hundred waggons, fighting
and dispersing a guard four or five times his number, and
appropriating to the use of the Confederacy the supplies and
transportation intended for Sheridan's army. At other tunes he will
fly at much higher game, piercing the centre of a large column on the
march, and before either the van or rear are aware of the cause of the
momentary tumult, he will be flying to the mountains with a goodly
number of prisoners. It is impossible to describe the terror that he
excites amongst the Federals; and whenever a party of them are moving
through the valley they are most eager in their inquiries as to
whether Mosby is anywhere in the neighbourhood. Of course they get but
little information from the inhabitants, whose idol he is. Originally,
Mosby's band consisted of but one company, but it has lately been
raised to a thousand, and he himself made a colonel in the Confederate
army, though none of his men are regularly enlisted soldiers. They are
mostly sons of farmers and gentlemen, who prefer the ubiquitous life
and its stirring adventures offered by their chieftain to the
comparative monotony of the ranks in a Virginia regiment. They receive
no pay from the War Office, but, instead of it, they are allowed to
dispose of their captures for their own benefit, the Government being
the purchaser. As soon as an expedition has been resolved upon, Mosby
sends a summons to his men, who are dispersed in every direction, to
meet him at some gap in the mountains, generally at night, and few
fail to answer the call. If they should do so three times
consecutively they are immediately handed over to the authorities and
conscribed into the regular army. My sketch shows a rendezvous of the
band in a pass of the Blue Ridge; Mosby is seated on his horse in the
shadow of a rock, and troopers are galloping up on all sides; others
are dismounted, waiting the order to move. Beneath, the Shenandoah
river winds its course through the fertile valley of
Virginia."</p></div2>

<p>....<hi rend="italic">The War in America</hi>--1863-64. By Edward
Pollard. (1 vol. Saunders, Otley, and Co.) Mr. Pollard, who was lately
editor of the <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi>, has already
given his account of the first two years' war in America; and he has
now brought his narrative down to the critical moment when the
cautious Confederate General Johnston was superseded by the dashing
Hood. It will be seen, therefore, that he has left off at a point when
the campaign in Georgia became particularly interesting; but the
readers of the daily newspapers will easily supply for themselves what
Mr. Pollard's history lacks. Indeed, it is a question whether an
attentive perusal of the newspapers will not have given the peruser
quite as vivid and accurate an idea of the whole war up to the present
time as can be derived from Mr. Pollard's book. Mr. Pollard, as is
natural, is a warm partisan of the Southern cause and an ardent hater
of the Yankee. According to him, Yankee Generals are incarnate fiends,
and Yankee privates are not much better. Peace between North and
South, except the "wayward sisters" be allowed to have their desire,
is utterly impossible. And yet he is by no means a worshipper of
Mr. Jefferson Davis; he accuses Mr. Davis of conceit and obstinacy,
and attributes no less a disaster than the loss of Vicksburg to
Mr. Davis's headstrong partiality for General Pemberton. The story of
the war is told in a sufficiently sickening manner by the impassible
telegraph: whoever has the stomach to swallow it, warmed by passion
and spiced with virulence, will do well to try a dose of Mr. Pollard's
preparation....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> relations of our chief Transatlantic
colony to the United States are not quite so cordial just now as could
be wished. None of the ties which connect them together in
international friendship are actually severed, but a process has set in
which, if allowed to go on much further, may very possibly end in
rupture. Symptoms of incipient inflammation are already visible, and
even where irritability of feeling is but slight, it greatly increases
reasonable apprehension of the effects which may result from
accidental causes. We believe that neither in the States nor in the
colony is war desired by either the people or their Governments. And
yet it cannot be concealed that, in opposition to the interests, the
policy, and the will of both, an extraneous agent of discord has
thrust itself between them, and has succeeded in giving to their
position toward each other an aspect of antagonism. The best of
neighbours are sometimes set together by the ears by the intemperance
of some third party, and nations are occasionally brought into
collision by the compulsory discharge of responsibilities which might
have remained dormant but for the follies and crimes of people whom
they both condemn.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the border States of the American Union
have suffered more from the raids of so-called Confederates from the
frontiers of Canada than any people would be likely to tolerate with
equanimity. The actual amount of damage done may have been small; but
the sense of insecurity, the apprehension, the suspense excited over a
wide extent of country, have been considerable, and have naturally
given rise to excessive soreness of feeling. The raiders were
political refugees from the Southern States, to whom Canada, nobly
imitating therein the policy of the mother country, had accorded
prompt and generous hospitality. Unfortunately, the guests who
received shelter in the colony do not seem to have recognised any
obligation of consulting the convenience of their host, and, under the
protection they have received, assert their right to levy war against
and harry a neighbour with whom she is at peace. Without inquiring
into the prevailing sympathies of Canada in reference to the pending
struggle in the United States, it is sufficient that her Govern<pb
n="78"/>ment honestly reprobated any such abuse of her hospitality,
and showed its sincerity by disclosing to the Government at Washington
every conspiracy against it of which it had an inkling of
information. This neighbourly loyalty was so far reciprocated that,
when the St. Albans raiders were captured by the Vermont militia on
the Canadian side of the border, the prisoners with their plunder were
unhesitatingly given up to the colonial authorities and their
extradition demanded in conformity with law. The unhappy decision of
Judge Coursal, by which the raiders were set at liberty and their
booty restored to them, gave a momentary appearance of collusion
between them and the government at Quebec. Momentary, we say, for the
judgment was repudiated at head-quarters the next morning, and fresh
warrants were issued against the accused, but quite sufficient to fire
susceptibilities and passions not easy to be quenched. In the full
blaze of this indignation General Dix issued his intemperate order to
the military under his command to pursue all future raiders across the
border if necessary, and to bring them thence to be dealt with as
martial law in the United States might determine--an order for setting
at naught the Queen's sovereignty which Mr. Lincoln had the good sense
immediately to command the General to withdraw. Nevertheless, although
the Canadian Government acted with the greatest decision and energy in
endeavouring to counteract the mischief of Coursal's judgment, have
since recaptured most of the liberated raiders, and have dispatched to
the frontier a force of volunteers competent to prevent future
depredation, the brief hurricane of anger in the States compelled the
unwilling statesmen at Washington, and afforded an opportunity to the
willing, to take some steps which have placed the relations of the two
Governments in a rather unsatisfactory position.</p>
<p>Canada is menaced with two serious evils by the President, and is
already galled by the infliction of another by Mr. Seward. Mr. Lincoln
is proceeding to give the six months' notice to the British Government
necessary to free the United States Government from the obligations of
the treaty which restrains both Powers from having more then one armed
vessel on the great inland waters that divide their respective
dominions. The wisdom of that treaty, and its effectiveness in
preventing needless expense and hostile collisions, have been fully
recognised by both parties, and incontestably proved by a long
experience. In what precise way the abrogation of it will operate for
the security of the American border States from the incursions of
lawless men, it is difficult to see. The only certain effect of it
will be to compel Canada to maintain on the lake flotillas of equal
strength, to involve both Governments in unnecessary expenditure, and
to multiply the chances of future misunderstandings. The step has
probably been taken partly with a view to threaten Canada, but chiefly
for the purpose of amusing irritated public feeling in the North, and,
possibly, the notice will not be followed up by action.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has also intimated to our Government that the
Reciprocity Treaty, which will soon expire, will not be renewed in its
present form. It is a strictly commercial agreement between the two
Governments, under which great advantages have accrued to the people
on both sides. It may be that the balance of advantage has been in
favour of Canada; but, in truth, each country gets by means of it what
it most wants from its neighbour at a much cheaper rate. Here again
the political wisdom of the menace is lost in obscurity. Canada cannot
be punished by the termination of the treaty without including in her
punishment large and influential classes in the States themselves; and
the Chamber of Commerce at Detroit, to which the question was referred
for examination and report, have lucidly pointed out the mischief
which the execution of the threat will inflict upon the trade and
prosperity of the American Union, as well as its utter inutility as a
political expedient. Where the interests are mutual, and ample time
remains for deliberation, it may be hoped that sober judgment will set
aside the intentions of temporary exasperation.</p>
<p>But Mr. Seward has struck his blow at once. He has established a
passport system along the frontier, which, as the <hi
rend="italic">Toronto Globe</hi> observes, can be of no earthly use
for the prevention of raids; but which, by the heavy price demanded
for passes, not only prevents any American from passing into or out of
Canada who can possibly do his business in any other way, and thus
deprives her, to a large extent, of a large and lucrative traffic, but
which also taxes the trade which may be carried on in spite of the
regulation. In point of fact, the telegram sent over by the last mail
represented the overland intercourse between the two countries as very
nearly suspended, which statement, although pointing to a possible
truth, must be regarded as giving us a description of facts as they
are seen though the mist exhaled by anger. The commercial dealings
between Canada and the United States are too numerous, too various,
and too important, to allow of their being carried on satisfactorily
without the passing and repassing of commercial agents across the
border. A six-dollar fine each way is a heavy tax, no doubt; but
scarcely heavy enough, one would imagine, to stop all traffic
requiring personal superintendence. And, indeed, thus much may be
inferred from the <hi rend="italic">Globe's</hi> proposal to levy on
the Canadian aide, sum for sum, whatever is levied on the American
side. "No American," says that journal, "who can help it will, while
Mr. Seward's passport system exists, cross the boundary line either
way. But those whose business compels them to do so would not be
prevented therefrom by an additional six dollars. We have as good an
excuse for carrying out our plan as the Government of the United
States have for carrying out theirs. They wish to prevent raids; so do
we. They have instituted a passport system for the purpose; let us
follow their example; let us make all the passports they have issued
worthless, so far as we are concerned, until they have been
vis&#x00E9;ed by our agent to an equal charge to that of the United
States. We may just as well make money out of the business as
they."</p>
<p>We trust the Government at Quebec will think long and seriously
before they act on this advice. That the course proposed will not mend
matters is obvious. That it will contribute but little to the Canadian
Exchequer is confessed. It would be simple retaliation, which, in the
present state of affairs, is precisely what is least to be
desired. Mr. Seward, whose bias and habits as a politician are known
more than they are honoured, has committed the United States
Government to an act of petty vindictiveness. It would be bad policy
it the Canadian Government should suffer themselves to be provoked
into following his undignified example, and thus throw the sympathy of
American traders into his scale. The existing irritation is temporary
in its character and mainly factitious. Wise statesmanship will give
it time to die away. Just now, the most pressing duty of the Canadians
is to mature and set in motion the Constitutional machinery which will
make British North America a strong empire, and to put up, as best
they may, with the small annoyances inflicted upon them by regulations
which injure their neighbours as much as themselves. Great and
permanent interests are at stake, and it is by their regard to these
rather than by the impulse of angry excitements, even if justifiable,
that their present policy should be shaped. They have borne themselves
nobly hitherto; let them not descend to a miserable contest with
Mr. Seward, nor fight him with vulgar weapons. As a matter of fact,
although through no fault of theirs, the fire was kindled by sparks
from their own side, and they will, doubtless, recognise the propriety
of forbearing to add fuel to the flame.</p></div2>

<p>The news from New York, to the 11th inst., is unusually barren of
military events. We hear much of preparations, and some movements are
reported which may prove preliminary to important undertakings, but
there are no operations of consequence.</p>
<p>There were rumours of Federal expeditions on a large scale, to be
led by Generals Sherman and Thomas. The former is to operate in
Georgia and North Carolina; and another attempt to take Wilmington is
to be made, a land force being sent from Newbern to attack the city in
the rear while a combined naval and military force operates against
Fort Fisher. General Thomas was concentrating his troops on the
Tennessee, with the view of making a campaign through Mississippi and
Alabama. The Confederates were preparing to meet these aggressions;
and it was rumoured that General Lee had been placed in command of all
the Confederate forces, and that, putting Beauregard in command of the
defences of Richmond, he himself intended to go and confront
Sherman. General Hood was re-forming his army and getting in readiness
to meet Thomas or operate against Sherman.</p>
<p>The armies before Richmond and Petersburg have for some time ceased
to be the most active of the Federal forces; and the only change
reported from that quarter is the supercession of General Butler by
General Ord, an able and well-tried soldier. Butler has been ordered
to report himself at Lowell, Massachusetts, his native place. Various
charges, military and civil, have been brought against him, and his
disgrace appears to be complete. His removal gives rise to very little
difference of opinion. A few, however, remark that he is now out of
place, while a great number insist that he had been out of place for
the past four years. The committee on the failure of the great mine at
Petersburg has made its report. General Burnside is exonerated from
all responsibility for the failure, and Generals Grant and Meade are
censured.</p>
<p>General Sheridan has established his troops in comfortable winter
quarters in the Shenandoah Valley. Great scarcity of food is said to
exist in this once rich but often devastated district.</p>
<p>Up to the close of last year 3,604,743 men had been draughted into
the Federal armies by the conscription orders of the Washington
Government. In 1861 there were 664,743 men draughted; in 1862 there
were 740,000; in 1863 there were 700,000; and in 1864 there were
1,500,000, making the grand total as above. This embraces only the
several calls and draughts, and is quite independent of voluntary
enlistments and the 500,000 men called for a few days ago.</p>
<p>The Messrs. Blair, father and son, have again set out for the
capital of the Confederacy, on a supposed peace mission, not
official.</p>
<p>A bill passed by the Federal Senate emancipates the wives and
children of coloured soldiers.</p>
<p>The Washington Government has sent forces to the Canadian frontier
to prevent persons coming into the United States without a
passport.</p>
<p>The Governor of the State of New York, in his inaugural message,
delivered on the 2nd inst., stated that 182,766 alien immigrants
arrived at the port of New York in the course of the year 1864--an
increase of more than 25,000 over the number in 1863, and as large a
number as in any year since 1854.</p>
<p>The Rev. Henry Ward Beecher presided this year, as usual, at the
annual letting of pews and aisle-seats in Plymouth Church,
Brooklyn. The proceedings took place in the church on the 34d
inst. The premiums bid were much larger than ever before. The highest
bid last year was 200 dols.; this year, 400 dols., which, added to the
pew-rent, makes the largest total payment for the year for one pew 520
dols. Twelve pews were sold at prices (including premium and pew-rent)
exceeding 400 dols. each, and sixteen more brought above 300 dols. The
congregation have raised the salary of their pastor from 7500 dols. to
12,500 dols. per year.</p>
<p>Governor Cannon, in his annual message to the Legislature of
Delaware, again takes strong ground in favour of emancipation in that
State, as he did in his inaugural address.</p>
<p>The Missouri Convention have resolved to reorganise the State
Constitution.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Boston Traveller</hi> publishes a list of 103
persons in that city whose annual incomes are above 25,000 dols., as
returned under the special income tax. Ten taxpayers in the fourth
district are assessed upon incomes of more than 100,000 dols. each,
after the deductions allowed by law were made.</p>
<p>Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, in his annual message, just
issued, calls attention to the excess of women in Massachusetts, and
to the surplus of men in Oregon, California, and other remote western
communities. In Oregon, having 52,160 inhabitants, according to the
Census of 1860, there were 19,961 males over fifteen years old, and
only 9878 females above that age. Its population is estimated at over
100,000, this disproportion yet remaining. In Massachusetts there were
257,833 males between the ages of fifteen and forty, and 287,000
females; or, a surplus of 29,166. The excess (the Governor says) of
women of all ages above fifteen years was 38,846. The absorption of
men by the military and naval service during the intervening four
years has aggravated this disproportion. He recommends the adoption of
some practical way by which young women may be enabled to emigrate to
useful fields of employment in the Western States.</p>
<p>A party of about 1600 Indians made an attack on Julesburg, Colorado
territory, on the 7th inst., robbed the overland mail and express,
dispersed a mule-train, destroyed the stage-station and a large amount
of the telegraph materiel, and killed nineteen soldiers and
citizens. A severe fight took place between the Indians and the
troops, the latter numbering altogether less than a hundred; but the
former were finally driven off, with the loss of their chief and
twenty-four others killed.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Montreal Court (as stated in a portion of our Impression last
week) has reconsidered its decision in the case of the St. Albans
raiders, and has decided that it has jurisdiction in the matter.</p>
<p>It is said that the new Federal passport system has nearly put an
end to the travelling of Americans in Canada, the passenger-trains on
both the Grand Trunk and Great Western Railroads now running nearly
empty west of Toronto.</p></div2>

<p>....Talking of companies (limited), we hear that a body of
gentlemen, long residents in, or acquainted with, or interested in the
United States, are about to try in London an experiment which in New
York has, of late years, met with triumphant success. It isn't
tramway; it isn't volunteer fire companies; it isn't paper
currency. But what will our readers think of a "London 'Delmonico'
Company" (limited)? Delmonico's at New York is simply the best and
most splendid restaurant in the world. There is nothing in Paris to
beat it; there is nothing in London, with all its plethora of hotels
and dining-rooms, to equal it. Delmonico's is a combination of the
Trois Fr&#x00E8;res, the Maison Dor&#x00E9;e, Philippe's (Rue
Montorgueil), Bignon's, the Trafalgar at Greenwich, the Star and
Garter at Richmond, the Hotel de Russie at Frankfort, Florian's at
Venice, the Ship and Turtle, Leadenhall-street, Darba's at
St. Petersburg, and the dining-rooms of the best Pall-mall clubs. You
may dine at Delmonico's for a dollar, and for a party of eight your
bill may come to a thousand dollars--precisely as you please. You may
be served off gold, and have pearls dissolved in your sauterne if you
choose. The projected "London 'Delmonico' Company" will of course
appeal chiefly to the wealthiest and moat luxurious classes. The
locale will be a splendid mansion at the West End, the furniture will
be gorgeous, the waiters irreproachable, the cookery simply
perfection, the wines:--<hi rend="italic">ne m'en parlez pas</hi>. The
servants will be superb in plush and silk stockings; and for a <hi
rend="italic">diner d'&#x00E9;l&#x00EE;te</hi> the major-domo will
bring in the first dish with a silver chain round his neck and a sword
by his side, according to the grand old traditions of the days of Ude,
and Car&#x00EA;me, and D'Ouix. The experiment is a bold one; but what
may not be tried in London the stupendous?</p></div2>

<p>By the arrival of the Nova Scotian we have news from New York to
the 21st ult.</p>
<p>Whilst General Butler was giving evidence at Washington of the
impossibility of taking Fort Fisher, that powerful stronghold fell
under a combined attack of Admiral Porter's fleet and an assault made
by General Terry in person. The Wilmington expedition arrived off Fort
Fisher a second time on the morning of the 13th ult. At an early hour
Admiral Porter dispatched a portion of his fleet to a point about
three miles and a half from Fort Fisher, with orders to shell the neck
of land which at this place separates the shore from the river, and
which was thickly wooded, whilst in the meanwhile the iron-clad
frigates and the monitors were ranged within a distance from the fort
varying from half to three-quarters of a mile. At nine o'clock in the
morning the landing of the troops was begun, and as 200 boats had been
told off from the fleet to convey the soldiers from the transports to
the shore, 4000 troops were safely landed in the course of an
hour. The vessels which had been engaged in shelling the woods
previous to the landing of the troops then moved in the direction of
Fort Fisher, continuing to shell the adjoining line of coast; and at
four o'clock in the afternoon, the disembarkation having been
completed, the Federal troops, to the num<pb n="103"/>ber of 6000,
advanced two miles up the promontory, thus reducing their distance
from the fort to a mile and a half, where they remained until the
15th, on the evening of which day the fort was taken by
assault. Whilst one portion of the fleet was engaged, on the morning
of the 13th, in covering the landing of the troops, the ironclads and
monitors opened a bombardment on Fort Fisher. This bombardment is
described as having been incessant during the greater part of that
day, and the guns of the fort were either silenced or the commander of
the garrison was convinced of the inutility of firing upon the Federal
ironclads. In the course of the same day Admiral Porter directed the
wooden frigates, which had in the morning been engaged in shelling
that part of the coast where the troops landed to take part in the
bombardment, which they did, without, however, provoking a return fire
from Fort Fisher. During the night shells were occasionally discharged
against the fort, and on the afternoon of the following day the
bombardment was renewed in all its previous intensity. On the morning
of the 15th it was continued, and at four o'clock on the same
afternoon the troops made the assault. Whilst three brigades advanced
to the attack, a division of the Federal army, remaining on the ground
it had occupied for the preceding two days, held the promontory
against the Confederate forces, which, under Hoke, advanced from the
direction of Wilmington, and which would otherwise have taken the
assaulting column in the rear. The defence of the fort was obstinate,
but fruitless. A battalion of sailors and marines, which had been
landed during the day in order to co-operate with the land forces, was
repulsed; but ultimately the garrison, being outnumbered, was obliged
to evacuate the fort. Hemmed in on one side by the river and on the
other by the sea, the Confederates (to the number of 1200) could not
retire beyond the extremity of the promontory, and as a matter of
course, were there compelled to surrender. The Federal loss was
considerable, but it is more then counterbalanced by what is
unquestionably a substantial success. On the first day the monitors
alone were at first engaged, and from eight in the morning till four
in the afternoon poured in 2000 ponderous shells--at the rate of four
a minute; then both divisions of the fleet, iron and wood, were
engaged with 312 guns, and in one hour and a half fired 21,600
shots. Fort Smith, on the opposite side of New Inlet, was subsequently
abandoned and blown up by the Confederates. Wilmington was reported to
be held by 5000 Confederates, under General Hoke; and it was not known
that further operations would be immediately undertaken by the
Federals. The <hi rend="italic">Richmond Examiner</hi> thinks that the
capture of Wilmington is not a necessary, but a probable, consequence
of the fall of Fort Fisher, and urges the burning of all cotton in
Wilmington.</p>
<p>In consequence of this success, General Grant has ordered a salute
of a hundred shotted guns to be fired against Petersburg and Richmond
by each of the armies co-operating against those cities.</p>
<p>General Sherman had sent part of his army to reinforce General
Foster, who had occupied Pocotaligo, on the Savannah and Charleston
Railway, the Confederates having abandoned their works there. It was
reported that General Sherman was menacing Branchville. It was stated
that a considerable body of Federals was intrenched at Franklin Mills,
on the Dog River, and that serious operations were about to be
undertaken against Mobile.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair has returned from Richmond, and a general impression
prevails that negotiations in some form are afoot on the question of
peace. In the Confederate Congress, however, a strong determination to
prosecute the war is expressed. The <hi rend="italic">Charleston
Mercury</hi> of the 12th ult. says:--"The crisis of the Confederacy
has arrived in fatal earnest. The result of the next six months will
bring the Confederacy to the ground or will reinstate its
power. Without reform we are doomed. There must be no more Jeff Davis
foolery, but brains and nerve; reform, shooting, cashiering, order,
subordination; soldiers--not runaways, ragamuffins, ruffians."
Mr. Foote, the Confederate orator who denounced the policy of
Jefferson Davis within the walls of the Southern Congress, has been
captured in an attempt to reach the Federal lines. General Lee, it was
alleged, was urging the Confederate Government to order a conscription
of negroes, and to emancipate the conscripts and their families.</p>
<p>The monitor Patapsco has been destroyed off Charleston, while on
picket duty, by several torpedoes. Fifty of the crew were drowned.</p>
<p>The resolution of Congress to terminate the Reciprocity Treaty has
been approved by President Lincoln; and the Senate has ratified the
notice to be given to England for the termination of the Lake Naval
Force Treaty. Senator Sumner has introduced into the Senate a
resolution proposing that notice should be given for the termination
of the Extradition Treaty with England.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislature had almost unanimously rejected a
resolution "to make peace through State action."</p>
<p>Slavery has been abolished in Missouri and Tennessee by State
conventions.</p>
<p>The Hon. Edward Everett, formerly Ambassador for the United States
at our Court, died recently, of apoplexy, in Boston. Mr. Lincoln
ordered the customary marks of respect to be paid to his memory. The
Government buildings in Washington were to be draped with mourning for
thirty days.</p>
<p>Captain Bell and three other Confederates, charged with the attempt
to burn the New York hotels in November last, have been arrested near
the Canadian frontier and consigned to Fort Lafayette. General Warren
has been ordered to convene a court-martial for their trial.</p>
<p>A considerable fluctuation in gold had taken place, prices ranging
between 199 and 206, the latter being the latest quotation.</p>
<p>A curling-match between Canada and the United States was played at
Buffalo on the 5th ult. At the close of the day the score was found to
be:--Americans, 478; Canadians, 658; showing a majority of 180 for
Canada. The curlers afterwards dined together in the American Hall. By
special order of Mr. Seward, passports were not required from the
Canadians at the frontier on this occasion.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Parliament met at Quebec on the 10th ult. The
Governor's message announced that a bill to give the Executive further
powers to deal with political refugees who commit outrages on the
border and a plan for the constitution of the Confederation, would be
laid before the Parliament.</p>
<p>One of the Canadian raiders has been declared guilty of robbery,
and been adjudged to be delivered over to the Federal authorities. A
writ of habeas corpus had been demanded on his behalf.</p></div2>

<p>....The Hon. Edward Everett is dead. He was one of the best of
American classical scholars--the Hon. Charles Francis Adams is said to
be the strongest in Greek. Mr. Everett's character, during a long and
active life, was very pure and blameless, and he was in all respects
the model of a courteous and polished American gentleman. He was at
one period Minister Plenipotentiary from the great Republic to the
Court of St. James's, and was nominated (on the "Bell and Everett
ticket") for Vice-President of the United States. He was great at
orations. His grand discourse on Washington was delivered no less than
129 times in different parts of the Union in aid of the funds for
purchasing Mount Vernon; and a couple of years since he pronounced a
harangue over the graves of the Federal soldiers killed at Gettysburg,
which an enthusiastic old lady-listener declared to be "as smooth as
sarce and as sweet as maple-candy." The sayings of American old ladies
of the Mrs. Partington type are wonderful, and most of them are
unrecorded. Did you ever hear of the remark of the ancient dame whose
farm-homestead had been alternately ravaged by Federal and Confederate
troops? "North and South," she observed; "it's four pecks o' one and a
bushel o' t' other. I've had 'em both. Longstreet's 'walk' men, and
Wolford's 'critter' men, they both kem around, and, 'twixt the two,
they caved in my ash-hopper that I wouldn't ha' taken two dollars and
a York shilling for." The ash-hopper was all the world to the old
lady.</p>
<p>The amiable imperturbability of the Hon. Edward Everett was
marvellous, and rivalled that of Sheridan, or Sheridan's friend, who,
when he had sent the hot roast goose flying into the lap of the lady
in pink satin, observed that "he would trouble her for that goose when
she had done with it." Nothing ruffled, nothing disturbed Mr. Everett,
He went on, smiling and beaming, beyond three score years and ten like
a Beautiful Image. He was once president of Harvard University; and
there is a story that at one of the "commencements" or commemorations
of that institution a wicked undergraduate who had recently been
expelled contrived to ensconce himself in the musicians' gallery,
which was directly over the dais, and amused himself during the
delivery of the inaugural oration by sprinkling flour on the
presidential head. The Honourable Edward at last became aware of the
farinaceous shower. He just gently inclined his head upwards;
"spotted" the culprit; then, without a word of remonstrance, unfurled
an umbrella; and uttered under that canopy such beautiful sentences
about Moschus, Bion, and the Pilgrim Fathers, that the auditory, who
had been on the broad grin, were hushed to reverential silence. It is
to be hoped that the wicked undergraduate forthwith repented, became a
hermit, and lived for the remainder of his blighted existence on
Greek roots and Congress water....</p></div2>

recollections of his deceased friend, Agostino Ruffini....</p>
<p>Next in interest to this tribute to the dead is Professor Goldwin
Smith's professedly slight and imperfect portrait of a great living
celebrity--President Lincoln. The ludicrous falseness of the popular
estimate of this remarkable man must by this time have become apparent
to all capable of reflection. Mr. Smith has contributed towards the
formation of a better one by some judicious observations; but, in
particular, by simply letting us see how the President is wont to
express himself on great occasions. No man, it must be conceded by all
who read this paper, could have spoken more simply and nobly over the
dead at Gettysburg; more firmly, and at the same time wisely and
moderately, on the question of emancipation; more tersely and
unanswerably than in rebutting the charges of illegal arrests. The
same spirit pervades all these utterances--that of a magistrate
severely conscious of his responsibilities, disinterested, energetic,
circumspect.....</p></div2>

<p>....It is precisely because we are sincerely solicitous for the
abiding welfare of the projected Confederation that we cannot join
some of our contemporaries in flaunting before the eyes of British
Americans the dazzling, but, in our opinion, improbable, prospect of
their one day becoming "the leading Power of the American continent."
It is a dream flattering to British vanity, and countenanced at the
present moment by some American malcontents. The British Americans
will do well not to import from this island the high-flying Imperial
ambition which once swayed Britons so powerfully, but which is now
somewhat out of date and fashion. "The leading Power on the American
continent," whoever it may be, will have the leading debt in the
American continent, will be the most prone to wars of empire, to wars
for a fanciful balance of power, or more probably for a real but
selfish preponderance. Such distinctions as these may be accepted as
the gratuitous gifts of destiny, but are not worth heavy sacrifices
for their attainment.</p>
<p>Still more important to the Confederation than its relations to
Great Britain and France (for we must not forget that Canada has a
hold upon the French heart also) are its relations to its powerful and
excitable neighbour. It is the instinct of danger in this direction
which has so rapidly brought to a head the idea of a British-American
Confederation. President Lincoln has given notice to the British
Government to terminate that stipulation of the treaty of Ghent,
which, in substance forbade the maintenance of a naval force on Lakes
Ontario and Erie. Congress has instructed, or is on the eve of
instructing, the President to give the requisite year's notice of the
termination of the Reciprocity Treaty with Canada. We will fling a
veil of oblivion over General Dix's passionate order, speedily
cancelled as it was by the President. The repeal of the Reciprocity
Treaty alone will exclude American vessels from the navigation of the
Canadian waters, natural and artificial, and place the disabilities of
the American fishing interests on the same footing as they were in
1852, when the American people were excited to a war point by the
simple enforcement of an almost unquestioned British right. The
birthday of the confederation will fall in no halcyon time of
security, but at an epoch when the minds of its citizens are brooding
anxiously about the future of their country and the various forms of
danger to which it may be exposed.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the free-trading interests of the Great West
will eventually outweigh in the political balance the Protectionist
tendencies of the Atlantic States, and that the repeal of one
reciprocity treaty will be only a step towards the conclusion of
another and an amended one. The pungent manifesto of the Detroit Board
of Trade, which has been recently republished in this country, gives
us an assurance that the men of the West will not allow their greatest
commercial interest, the export of grain and its free transit to the
seaboard, to go to the wall. That they will find willing allies in
British American statesmen the following well-conceived resolution
shows:--</p>
<q><p>The communications with the North-Western territory <hi
rend="italic">and the improvements required for the development of the
trade of the</hi> Great West with the seaboard, are regarded by this
Conference as subjects of the highest importance to the Confederation,
and should be prosecuted at the earliest possible period when the
state of the federal finances will permit the Legislature to do
so.</p></q>
<p>The improvements referred to are, we presume, the construction of
the Ottawa Canal and the deepening of the Welland and St. Lawrence
canals. Such being the highly precarious state of the commercial
relations between British America and the United States, it becomes
doubly incumbent on the former to establish that system of entire <hi
rend="italic">intercolonial</hi> free trade which is one of the most
prominent features of the new scheme. The sweeping away of four or
five provincial tariffs will be the best means of indemnifying the
British Americans for the possible loss of a reciprocity treaty with
the American Union.</p>
<p>To carry out this general system of free trade, as well as to
facilitate intercourse between the maritime provinces and Canada, it
is absolutely necessary that the missing links of the intercolonial
railroad, which is to connect Halifax with Quebec, be forthwith
completed. These missing links are two--viz., between Truro, in Nova
Scotia, and Shediac, in New Brunswick; and between Fredericton, N.B.,
and Rivi&#x00E8;re de Loup, the eastern terminus of the Grand Trunk
line, 114 miles below Quebec. The construction of this line was
recommended by Lord Durham in his celebrated "Report on the Affairs of
British North America," so early as January, 1839, at a time when the
present gigantic system of American and Canadian railroads was yet in
embryo. We quote this curious passage:--</p>
<q><p>The completion of any satisfactory communication between Halifax
and Quebec would, in fact, produce relations between these provinces
that would render a general union absolutely necessary. Several
surveys have proved that it would be perfectly practicable the whole
way. It appears to be a general opinion in the United States that the
severe snows and frosts of that continent very slightly impede and do
not prevent the travelling on railroads; and, if I am rightly
informed, <hi rend="italic">the Utica Railroad, in the northern part
of the State of New York, is used throughout the winter</hi>. If this
opinion be correct, the formation of a railroad from Halifax to Quebec
would entirely alter some of the distinguishing characteristics of the
Canadas. Instead of being shut out from all direct intercourse with
England during half the year, they would possess a far more certain
and speedy communication throughout the winter than they now possess
in summer. The passage from Ireland to Quebec would be a matter of ten
or twelve days, and Halifax would be the great port by which a large
portion of the trade, and all the conveyance of passengers to the
whole of British North America, would be carried on....If the great
natural channel of the St. Lawrence gives all the people who dwell in
any part of its basin such an interest in the government of the whole
as renders it wise to incorporate the two Canadas, the artificial work
which would, in fact, supersede the lower part of the St. Lawrence as
the outlet of a great part of the Canadian trade, and would make
Halifax, in a great measure, an outport to Quebec, would surely, in
the same way, render it advisable that the incorporation should be
extended to provinces through which such a road would pass.</p></q>
<p>Although Sir Robert Peel's Government was favourable to this
project, and offered to guarantee 4 per cent interest to the
investors, it has not yet been carried out. The want of it was
grievously felt by the empire in the winter of 1861-2, when the 10,000
British troops made their famous passage on sleighs between
Fredericton and Quebec. The same motives of economy and speed in the
conveyance of troops, military stores, and the mails which have
prompted the Indian Government to guarantee a certain rate of interest
upon the vast sums invested in Indian railroads, has at length
impelled both the Imperial and Colonial Governments to renew their
offers of a guarantee and grant of land to any capitalists who will
supply the missing links in the railroad chain between Halifax and
Quebec. As the surveys have long since been made, and the estimated
outlay is only &#x00A3;3,000,000 for a length of 350 miles, and
inasmuch as its execution is a condition precedent of the proposed
Confederation, we may soon expect to hear of its introduction on the
Stock Exchange....</p></div2>

<p>By the Moravian, we have intelligence from New York to the 28th
ult.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair had returned to Washington, having, it is said,
altogether failed in his peace mission. The Confederate House of
Representatives has unanimously confirmed the resolution to issue an
address to the Southern people announcing the determination of
Congress to continue the war; and at Washington resolutions have been
introduced into the Senate in favour of the continuance of the war
until the South shall make an unconditional submission. So it is clear
that "the end is not yet."</p>
<p>The Federal General Terry had demanded the surrender of Wilmington,
giving General Bragg until the 19th inst. to decide. Opinions differ
as to whether the Confederates would surrender or defend the place. In
the mean time Admiral Porter had occupied all the forts and works
abandoned by the enemy, and was feeling his way up the river.</p>
<p>A Confederate squadron, composed of three ironclads and five
gunboats, and said to have been commanded by Captain Semmes, descended
the James River during the night of the 23rd ult., with the supposed
purpose of surprising the Federal flotilla and destroying General
Grant's stores and transports at City Point. But the Confederate
vessels failed to pass the obstructions laid by the Federals in the
stream. One of them ran aground, and had to be destroyed; and the
others were compelled to return without effecting anything.</p>
<p>General Sherman has received considerable reinforcements, but
nothing definite is known as to his movements.</p>
<p>In the West there have been several movements of detached
expeditions.</p>
<p>The city of New York was to furnish 20,000 recruits under President
Lincoln's last levy; and the Government had refused to reduce the
quota.</p>
<p>President Davis has signed the Congressional resolutions creating
the office of general-in-chief. He has also sent a letter to the
Confederate Congress stating that, when General Lee took the command
of the army of Virginia, he was commanding all the armies of the
Confederate States, but was relieved of the latter command at his own
request. Whenever General Lee finds it practicable to assume the chief
command without withdrawing from the direct command of the army of
Virginia, Mr. Davis will deem it conducive to the public interest to
place him in that position. General Johnston has been reinstated, and
appointed, it is said, to the command of the Confederate army in the
West.</p>
<p>President Davis has written a long letter in which he argues
against separate State action, and also against the project of a
convention of all the States of the Confederacy and of the Union.</p>
<p>The New York oil "diggings" promise to become as remunerative as
those of Pennsylvania or West Virginia, and Cattaraugus County is fast
becoming the Mecca of those who hasten to be rich.</p>
<p>The Senate has ratified the treaties with the north-western bands
of Shoshoonee Indians establishing peace and friendship, the several
bands stipulating that hostilities and all depredations upon the
emigrant-trains, the mail and telegraph lines, and upon citizens of
the United States within their country, shall cease. The boundaries of
their country, as claimed and occupied by them, are thus given by the
<hi rend="italic">New York Tribune</hi>:--On the north, by the middle
of the Great Desert; on the west, by Steptue Valley; on the south, by
Toedon or Green Mountains; and on the east, by the Great Salt Lake,
Tuilla, and Rush Valleys. The Indians agree to remove to the
reservations whenever the President shall deem it expedient for them
to do so, and become herdsmen or agriculturists, the Government paying
them certain annuities in money, provisions, and goods. The Indians
also agree that the Pacific Railroad shall not be molested; that
military posts, &#x0026;c., may be constructed, the gold and silver
mines worked, and mining and agricultural settlements formed, and
rancheros established wherever they may be required.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government and Parliament are taking high ground in
the matter of the St. Albans outrages. Judge Coursol has been
suspended, and a bill introduced to make good the fifty thousand
dollars which were returned to the raiders on their release. In the
opening debate in Parliament the Government was sustained by a large
majority, and the conduct of the Southern refugees in Canada strongly
denounced. A determination was expressed to stop the abuse of
asylum. The Government is carrying out a general draught in order to
be prepared for the worst, but the speeches in Parliament<pb
n="127"/> are friendly to the United States. The Judges have decided
that Burleigh must be delivered up to the United States. A report that
the English Government had ordered the dispatch of gun-boats to the
great lakes is semi-officially contradicted.</p>
<p>A large majority in Parliament favours the confederation
scheme. The British Columbia and Vancouver Island journals are
agitating for the extension of the project to those colonies.</p>
<p>A movement is on foot for the annexation of Vancouver's Island to British Columbia and for the consolidation of the two Governments.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">TUESDAY</hi>.</p>
<p>The seventh session of the present Parliament was opened by
Commission. The ceremony was a very simple one. A few ladies assembled
in the House of Lords and occupied the back seats usually taken by the
peers. In the galleries there were also a few ladies. As soon as the
Royal Commissioners entered, the Lord Chancellor directed the Usher of
the Black Rod to summon the House of Commons, and in a few moments
afterwards the Speaker, in his state robes and accompanied by a few
members of the House of Commons, appeared at the bar. The Lord
Chancellor then read the</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Queen's Speech.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">My Lords And Gentlemen,</hi></p>
<p>We are commanded to assure you that her Majesty has great
satisfaction in recurring again to the advice and assistance of her
Parliament....</p>
<p>The civil war in North America still unhappily continues. Her
Majesty remains steadfastly neutral between the contending parties,
and would rejoice at a friendly reconciliation between them....</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Debate On The Address In Reply
To The Royal Speech.</hi></p>
<p>The House resumed at five o'clock, when, the Speech from the Throne
having been again read,</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Charlemont</hi> (in the absence of
the Duke of Cleveland, owing to domestic breavement) moved the Address
in reply to the Royal Speech. Having adverted to the principal
questions to which the attention of Parliament had been called, he
read some statistics referring to the condition of Ireland to prove
the gradual progress of that country, and maintained that though some
persons and parties were dissatisfied, the people were generally
loyal.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Houghton</hi> seconded the motion. After
referring to the treaty with France of 1852 and the confederation of
the British North American provinces, he defended her Majesty's
Government from the charge of having violated its neutrality in the
civil war now waging in America. He denied that in any one instance it
had ever departed from the policy of non-interference it had declared
it would observe. As to the relations of England to foreign nations
generally, he pointed out the important fact that wherever England was
in arms it was entirely in self-defence. The domestic legislation in
which they were asked to engage in the present Session would, he
assumed, be of the same kind as that of former years. The measures to
be proposed to them would mostly be of a practical character. He had
hoped that in some manner they would have succeeded in broadening the
basis of the Parliamentary representation; but that work was, perhaps,
reserved for another and more ardent generation. He hoped, however,
that some progress would be made in preparing a digest of the law of
England, a measure that certainly ought to receive serious
attention.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> described the Speech
from the Throne as just the sort of speech that was likely to be
addressed by an aged minister to a moribund Parliament, whose
dissolution no event can postpone; so that all its experienced
advisers could do was to find it some gentle occupation and take care
that its dying moments were not disturbed by any unnecessary
excitement; whilst its physicians held the usual consultation and
pocketed their accustomed fees. The noble Earl then adverted to our
relations with Brazil and the civil war in America, calling attention
to the ingratitude with which the neutrality of this country had been
met by the Government of Washington, who had given notice to terminate
the Reciprocity Treaty and the agreement for securing the neutrality
of the American lakes. Under these circumstances the noble Earl said
he regarded with satisfaction the proposed confederation of the
British North American provinces. He alluded to the distress in the
cotton districts, pointing out the condition of those districts; and
expressed his regret that legislation had not been determined upon as
the result of the Public Schools Commission.</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Granville</hi> congratulated their
Lordships upon the good sense and good humour displayed by the Earl of
Derby, and congratulated the latter upon the brilliant success which
had attended his literary labours during the recess. Referring to the
notice given by the Government at Washington to terminate the
Reciprocity Treaty with England, he stated his belief that it was to
be traced to irritation consequent upon the movements of Confederate
raiders, but that there was still time for negotiation.</p>
<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Leitrim</hi>, having spoken on the
Irish portion of the Speech,</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> stated his pleasure at
finding that there was a general approval of the House of the foreign
policy of the Government; but in answer to observations of Lord Derby
on the diplomatic rupture with Brazil, he denied that the Foreign
Office was to blame, or could have taken any other course than they
had adopted. As regarded American politics, he urged that the United
States expected that her Majesty's Government should do all that the
law of nations and international law required to prevent any aid being
given to the Confederates; but it had been impossible to prevent acts
by British subjects, which had caused great irritation in America,
such as the fitting out of ships in English ports to prey on the
commerce of the United States. In Canada also Confederate agents had
done acts calculated to embroil this country with the United States,
and it was not surprising that the Federal Government, seeing the
Canadian lake made use of for such purposes, should be inclined to
take steps to put a stop to such proceedings. While, however, her
Majesty's Government would adhere strictly to neutrality in the
American contest, they would not admit claims on this country which
were not founded on justice.</p>
<p>The Address was then agreed to.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">My Diary in America in the Midst of War.</hi> By
G. A. Sala. (Tinsley.) Mr. Sala's peculiar powers appear to the
greatest possible advantage in these two volumes; and the only
consequence is that there has not been published for many a long day a
book more full of entertainment and amusement. His keen faculty of
observation had full scope; his talent for minute description was
taxed to its utmost; his ability to place both persons and things in
the most striking light was freely exercised; his intimate
acquaintance with popular taste had a chance of showing itself; his
brilliant colouring had a fine opening for application; his
appreciation of humour did him excellent service; his capacious memory
or his punctual notification supplied him with copious stores of
anecdote; and his epigrammatic style of writing gave a pungent flavour
to the sentences which flowed from his pen. It must be remembered,
however, that the greater part of that which is contained in his two
volumes was written in the form of letters to a newspaper which has,
perhaps, the largest circulation of all daily publications in England,
if not in the world. The remembrance of this fact will enable the
reader to understand not only why Mr. Sala frequently speaks of
himself as "the subscriber," but also why he should have been accused
by the Americans (particularly those of extreme Northern principles)
of misrepresentation. For it is plain that he must have given ready
ear to what would be likely to amuse and to gratify his readers and to
increase the circulation of the paper for which he had undertaken his
pilgrimage; and how well Mr. Sala fulfilled his objects, let those
many admirers testify who purchased the <hi rend="italic">Daily
Telegraph</hi> simply for the pleasure to be derived from his
letters. Now, experience will tell you that there is nothing so
delightful as to have pointed out to you the mote in your neighbour's
eye; and in this respect Mr. Sala has been a most conscientious as
well as humorous showman. He would, of course, have scouted the idea
of putting upon paper what he had neither seen nor heard; but he would
naturally repeat not only what he saw but what he heard that was
likely, from its grotesqueness to convulse with laughter, from its
folly to put upon good terms with themselves, and from its horribility
to interest as well as shock his readers. In fact, the "chiel" who
"taks notes" in a foreign country nearly always does so in the spirit
of a censor. Hence the charge against Mr. Sala of misrepresentation,
by which is probably meant an unconsciously, perhaps, partial, but
still a partial, representation. A man who spends but a year in a
large country cannot gain an insight into its interior economy; he
gets but the public--which is usually the worse--view of it; and
Mr. Sala, so far as we can discover, does not seem to have penetrated
far, if at all, into American private society.  Nathaniel Hawthorne,
who lived amongst us in time of peace far longer than Mr. Sala lived
amongst the Americans in time of war, found occasion to apply the lash
to us and, though he did not lay it on with the rigour displayed by
Mr. Sala, even Nathaniel Hawthorne has been accused of
misrepresentation. However, that the Americans are not so black as
they have (not by Mr. Sala) been painted is proved by the fact that
Mr. Sala, in spite of his "misrepresentation," was not subjected to
the American amenities of cowhiding, tar-and-feathering, or gratuitous
riding upon a rail. He bit them hard, and they winced; but they took
no ruffianly vengeance such as they are reported to be in the habit of
taking. One is pained at Mr. Sala's views on the negro question; but,
on the whole, one is inclined to look upon his picture as a faithful
representation of matters as they appeared to a writer who was far
from a "Northern sympathiser," who was on the look out for literary
capital, and who was expected to make of his capital the most that he
possibly could. Mr. Sala was, of course, dependent to a considerable
extent upon hearsay, but it will be profitable in the interest of
truth to compare what he says at p. 361 and. at p. 377, vol. ii, with
what has been written about Sherman's barbarity in driving out the
inhabitants from Atlanta and about the composition of the Northern
armies. We read with respect to the former, "all the inhabitants who
were able fled from before the dreaded Yankees," from which one would
infer that there was no great hardship in removing those who would
have gone had they been able, and that Hood's letter to Sherman was
mere "tabu talk;" and with respect to the latter, "the best blood, the
best bone, the best sinew, of the Northern States have already been
offered up to this Moloch. There is scarcely a Unionist family--from
that of the millionaire merchant to that of the petty farmer and
store-keeper--which has not sent a son, a brother, and often even a
father and bread-winner to the war;" from which one would infer that
the Northern armies are not entirely or even principally, composed of
"Irish and German mercenaries." It is true that Sherman's reply to
Hood does not quite bear out the inference we have said might be
drawn, so that Mr. Sala's account may not be literally correct; but as
regards the composition of the Union armies, Mr. Sala is as likely to
be well informed as any other "special correspondent" or
"commissioner," and it is desirable, whatever one's individual
sympathies may be, that truth should not be sacrificed to prejudice
and passion.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE NEGRO IN AMERICA.</p>
<p>"<hi rend="italic">The coloured man</hi>," said Mr. Frederick
Douglas, the eloquent negro orator, at a lecture which he recently
delivered in New York, "<hi rend="italic">is the master of the
situation. Upon whichever side he shall declare himself, on that side
will be the victory</hi>." Mr. Douglas knows his people, and does not
exaggerate the importance of their action in the mighty struggle, of
which their emancipation was the pretext rather than the cause; and,
knowing them so well, his opinion that they will fight for their
masters, on the promise of freedom to themselves and families; that
they will not, as some abolitionists have predicted, turn their arms
against the cause in which their services are enlisted; but that, on
the contrary, they will zealously, faithfully, and bravely earn their
liberty on the terms proposed, is entitled to the respect which all
opinion founded upon knowledge claims from every rational man. As the
South, under the pressure of military necessity, is about to make this
vital experiment, for the sake of replenishing the ranks of its
dwindling and decimated armies, the time is favourable for a review of
the progress already made in the emancipation of the coloured race. As
a preliminary to the full comprehension of the subject, it should be
steadily borne in mind that the South, though it has always been
pro-slavery, has always been pro-negro; and that the North has, in
like manner, been anti-slavery and anti-negro. The South has
maintained that it was a good thing for America that the negroes
should remain in it and increase and multiply, and that it was a
better thing for the negro that he should be a slave than a free
man. The North, on the other hand, has maintained as strenuously that
slavery was an abomination, an outrage, and a crime; but that, all
things considered, it was a very bad thing for America that the negro
race had ever been introduced into it; and that if slavery were an
evil, free blacks were evils almost, if not quite, as flagrant. Social
prejudice set up and still insists on this preposterous claim. The
result is that throughout the North, the negro is systematically
repressed and deprived of social position and political privilege by
the tyranny of custom and the nameless operation of social laws. In
some of the States in the West neither negro slavery nor negroes are
allowed to exist, and in Illinois, if not in Indiana, it is a penal
offence for a coloured man to cross their borders and presume that he
has any right to dwell among his white superiors. The negroes of the
North feel this social excommunication more acutely than the negroes
of the South feel the oppression of slavery. In the South the white
man does not hate the negro, nor the negro the white man; while in the
North the love felt by antislavery agitators and others for the negro
is purely theoretical and political, and not in the slightest degree
social; while the opinion entertained by the negroes of their white
"friends," who talk so much and do so little in their behalf, is of
the kind which most men entertain towards palpable
hypocrisy. Mr. Lincoln once told a deputation of negroes that the best
thing they and their race could do would be to take themselves out of
the country, to go back to Africa, or drift down into Central
America. Mr. Douglas, speaking for his race, declares that they will
do nothing of the kind; that they will not be "improved off the face
of the earth," like the red Indians; that they have found a home in
America, and that they will keep it; and that their true place is
among friendly, and not among hostile, white people. Possibly, and
very probably, the result of Northern love for emancipation and of
dislike for the negro may be, if the South should achieve or help to
achieve its independence by the aid of the coloured people, that the
Northern negroes will gradually, if not collectively, migrate to the
South, attracted by the superior congeniality of the climate. In the
North their natural increase is not so great as in the South; in fact,
if their numbers were not augmented by fugitives from slavery, they
would die out as a people in a certain calculable length of time, as
may be discovered from the fact that the annual number of deaths among
them is greater than that of the births.</p>
<p>The South hold the doctrine that the Federal Government had neither
the right nor the power to abolish slavery, but that the only agency
which could effect the purpose was the lawful and Constitutional
legislation of the States in which the institution
existed. Mr. Lincoln, for military reasons and for State necessity,
abolished slavery by proclamation and by stroke of the pen as the Pope
would abolish heresy by an encyclical letter. But slavery remained
unaffected by his fulminations and only perished in districts where
his armies were able to penetrate, holding its own as firmly elsewhere
as if he had never issued his proclamation against it. And now, in the
fourth year of the war, though slavery is falling right and left, it
is not because of his proclamation, but because the Border States of
Maryland, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri have, in their sovereign
capacity, resolved to abolish in Congress, which is ready to indorse
all Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds, finding the futility of
"proclamations" or "edicts" of military power, debates an amendment to
the Federal Constitution--a document which permits slavery, but which,
if the amendment shall pass, it will tolerate no longer. And more
effectual than anything that the North can do or propose, the South
takes measures not alone to emancipate its slaves, but to elevate them
in the social scale, and link the fortunes of the white man and the
black by the ties of mutual interest and reciprocal gratitude. The
black man man in the North is free, but a pariah. In the South, it is
probable that the black man who shall have served in the Confederate
army will be free, and as much of a man as soldiership and the respect
of his white contemporaries can make him.</p>
<p>It would appear from a consideration of all these circumstances
that the emancipation of the slaves is more likely to be
satisfactorily effected by the Southern than by the Northern
people. So passionately does the North love the Union, so immense are
the sacrifices of pride, as well as of material resources, that it is
prepared to make for its darling object, that, were the South to
declare that it would lay down its arms on the sole condition of the
maintenance of slavery by the whole force of the united Governments,
the majority of the North would in all probability accede to the
proposal. The negroes know the fact; and such men as Douglas give very
significant hints at all available opportunities that they will not
consent to be played with by either side, but will make their own
bargain whenever they think they have arrived at the decisive moment
of the struggle. There can be little doubt that the South can be of
greater benefit to them than the North; that the South, by reason of
its climate, is a better home for people of their blood than the
frozen regions of New York, New England, or the great North-West; and
that, under a properly-organised system of labour which would be
necessary to prevent them from becoming paupers in becoming free men,
the South, if it should be recognised among the independent nations of
the earth, would be enabled, by means of its freed negroes, to develop
its immense sources more rapidly than it was ever able to do under the
system of slavery; and that, finally, slavery would disappear
altogether. Should, however, the South be conquered, the question of
the negro as well as the question of slavery will not be so easily
settled. Slavery may be abolished, but the Northern overseer will take
the place of the Southern master, the relations of the races will be
as unkindly throughout the whole Union as they now are in the North,
and the poor negro will be fortunate if he escape in the sequel the
fate of other races that could not be enslaved and as a consequence
were exterminated.</p></div2>

<p>A pleasant hit at the neck-and-neck race of extravagance which the
two powers Shoddy and Petroleum are running in the States is thus made
in a paragraph in the <hi rend="italic">New York
Tribune</hi>:--Mrs. A., accompanied by Mrs. B., recently paid a visit
to Tiffany's, and bought there, aided by her friend's counsel, a
stylish assortment of jewellery for her own proper wearing. Before
they had quite concluded their purchases a stranger, whom we will call
Mrs. C., came in, and, after requiring the services of half the
attendants, bought a far more extensive and costly assortment of
richly set precious stones, for the adornment of her
person. Whereupon: Mrs. A. to Mrs. B. (in an undertone), "Evidently
Shoddy." Mrs. C. (overhearing), "No, Madam, Petroleum."--Another story
of the same kind is told. A young lady in Pennsylvania informed her
lover that the match must be broken off. "Why?" gasped the unfortunate
lover. "Dad has struck oil," replied the damsel, determined not to
lose her chance of a better match.</p></div2>

<p>The latest news from New York is to the morning of the 5th
inst. Accounts of the opening of peace negotiations between the
Federals and the Confederates, and of their complete failure, reached
us almost simultaneously. The Canada, which arrived during Tuesday
night from Boston and Halifax, brought the news that three Confederate
Commissioners--Vice-President Stephens, Senator Hunter, and Judge
Campbell--had arrived at Fort Monroe on the 2nd inst., in order to
discuss peace unofficially; that Secretary Seward had gone to Fort
Monroe to meet them; and that President Lincoln himself had left
Washington for Fort Monroe in consequence of a telegram from
Mr. Seward. This important<pb n="151"/> news was brought to us by New
York despatches to the afternoon of the 8rd inst. The Hibernian, which
arrived on Wednesday evening, brought, however, telegraphic news from
New York to the morning of the 5th inst., to the effect that the peace
conference between President Lincoln, Mr. Seward, and the Confederate
Commissioners has proved a failure, and that both Governments remain
as they were. President Lincoln and Secretary Seward had returned to
Washington; and a secret session of the Cabinet had been held
there. The Associated Press despatches state that President Lincoln
and Mr. Seward had an informal conference with Messrs. Hunter,
Stephens, and Campbell, on board a steamer at Hampton Roads, which
lasted four hours; and it is positively known that it resulted in no
change in the attitude of either government. In other words, it was a
failure.</p>
<p>The war news is not important. There had been no operations in the
neighbourhood of Richmond; and the Confederate squadron had retired up
the James River. Part of the Federal fleet had left the Cape Fear
River for Charleston; and it would seem from Confederate accounts that
the Federals had assembled their troops near Fort Fisher, and had
probably abandoned for a time active operations against the town of
Wilmington. The main body of General Sherman's army had crossed the
Savannah River, and commenced on the 17th ult. its march, in three
columns, through South Carolina towards Charleston and Branchville,
but had experienced great difficulties at the outset in consequence of
heavy rains, which had rendered the swamps impassable. Federal
accounts stated that General Sherman was within forty miles of
Charleston, that General Foster was co-operating with him, and that
the Confederates were offering resistance at every point but were
being rapidly driven from all their defensive positions. Confederate
despatches, however, asserted that all General Sherman's efforts to
cross the Combahee River had hitherto failed. A number of steamers had
been sent from Cairo up the Tennessee and Cumberland River for the
purpose, as it was said, of removing General Thomas's army to "a new
base." The Confederate General Hill had announced that, in case of
need, all the cotton stored in Augusta would be burned, even though
the burning might cause the destruction of the city; and the Richmond
papers stated that measures had been taken to destroy all cotton in
Georgia and the Carolinas whenever it might be in danger of falling
into the Federals' hands.</p>
<p>President Davis has appointed the 10th of March as a day of fast
and prayer. The Confederate Congress was considering a bill for the
impressment of 40,000 negroes for "menial service" with the army, and
had rejected an amendment providing that none of them should at any
time be armed and employed as soldiers. General Breckenridge has been
appointed Confederate Secretary for War.</p>
<p>The Federal War Department has arranged to exchange with the South
all prisoners now in close confinement or in irons.</p>
<p>Admiral Porter has made a special report to the Federal Government
on the monitors. He says they behaved better in rough weather when off
Fort Fisher than any of the rest of the fleet, though they became very
uncomfortable for the officers and men, shipping much water. On one of
his ironclads the Admiral gets quite eloquent. He says:--"The
Monadnock is capable of crossing the ocean alone (when her compasses
are once adjusted properly), and could destroy any vessel in the
French or British navy, lay their towns under contribution, and return
again (provided she could pick up coal) without fear of being
followed. She could certainly clear any harbour on our coast of
blockaders in case we were at war with a foreign Power."</p>
<p>General Butler had made a speech at Lowell, in which he fiercely
attacked Admiral Porter, and especially General Grant, whom he charged
with preventing an exchange of prisoners with the South and with
lavishly wasting the blood of his troops. As to himself, he hoped that
when he died his epitaph might be--"Here lies the General who saved
the lives of his soldiers at Big Bethel and Fort Fisher, and who never
commanded the army of the Potomac."</p>
<p>A joint resolution submitting to the decision of the State
Legislatures the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery
throughout the United States has passed the House of Representatives,
amid great enthusiasm, by 119 ayes to 56 noes. The Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and Western Virginia Legislatures and the
New York Assembly have ratified the constitutional amendment and it
has been ratified in Illinois and Rhode Island by the Lower Houses. In
the Senate Mr. Sumner has introduced resolutions declaring the consent
of the rebel States to the measure to be unnecessary while they are in
rebellion; and the Senate has passed joint resolutions declaring
Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee,
not entitled to representation in the Electoral College. President
Lincoln has been serenaded at Washington, when he made a speech, in
which he said that the passage of the amendment abolishing slavery was
an occasion of congratulation for the whole world. He thought the
measure was a fitting if not indispensable adjunct to the winding up
of the great difficulty. He wished the re-union of the States to be so
effected as to remove all causes of future disturbance. "The
emancipating proclamation," said Mr. Lincoln, "falls short of what the
amendment will effect when consummated."</p>
<p>The Senate has passed the retaliation resolutions, with the
amendment that the retaliation should be in conformity with the usages
of war among civilised nations.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the bill for the
construction of a ship canal around the Niagara Falls, and also for
the Illinois-Michigan Canal. The latter will enable gun-boats to pass
from the Mississippi to Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Mr. Stanton has ordered the re-annexation of Arizona to the Pacific
department, under General Macdowell. The limits of the Southern
department are intended to embrace North Carolina.</p>
<p>A coloured lawyer has been admitted to the bar of the Supreme
Court.</p>
<p>The peace negotiations diminished the premium on gold at New York
to about 105 per cent; but it rose again to about 113 per cent on the
4th inst., when the failure of those negotiations became known.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government has given up Burleigh, the Confederate
partisan who seized a steamer on Lake Erie, for trial in the United
States; and the Canadian Legislature has almost unanimously passed the
Alien Bill introduced by the Colonial Ministry. This bill provides
that, on complaint of a resident, the Governor-General may order
aliens to quit the Provinces, after giving them notice, through the
<hi rend="italic">Official Gazette</hi>, of their intended
expulsion. The accused may, however, tender reasons for
non-compliance.</p>
<p>Te report of Colonel Jervois respecting the defences of Canada has
been published. Colonel Jervois is of opinion that if Montreal and
Quebec were placed in a condition for defence, and the river between
Montreal and Quebec commanded by iron-plated vessels, a successful
resistance could be made to any attempt to subjugate the country, so
long as Great Britain had the command of the sea. The defence of Upper
Canada is, in his opinion, more difficult. Even there, however, points
are to be found--for instance, Kingston, Toronto, and and
Hamilton--which, if properly fortified, would offer a most serious, if
not effectual, resistance to an enemy.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">WILMINGTON AND THE CAPE FEAR RIVER,<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">North Carolina.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Map of Wilmington and the Cape Fear
River, which appears on the following page, will doubtless have a
peculiar interest for our readers, as placing before them the some of
Admiral Porter's recent successes. The subjoined particulars have been
furnished by a correspondent direct from "Dixie's Land," who was
during four days, an eye-witness of the bombardment of Fort Fisher,
and to whom a three months' previous residence at Wilmington had given
many facilities for procuring the latest and most reliable
information. The port of Wilmington, North Carolina, is situated about
twenty miles north of the New Inlet entrance to the Cape Fear
River. It is about four miles long and three miles broad, numbering
nearly 6000 inhabitants, of whom two thirds are negroes. The streets
are built at right angles, and contain many handsome edifices, among
which the City Hall, the Custom House, and the marble mansion of
J. A. Taylor, a wealthy Northerner, are the most
conspicuous. Wilmington, however, owes its notoriety to having been
the principal port of rendezvous for blockade-runners since the
closing of Charleston Harbour. In spite of the vigilance of the
Federal cruisers--there were on an average eighteen blockading the
different entrances--as many as 164 runners successfully passed in and
out in the twelve months elapsing between Oct. 1, 1863, and Oct. 1,
1864. The value of imports, through the blockade, for the year ending
June 30, 1864, was 3,276,000 dols.; and of exports, 65,185,000
dols.--figures not even attained in prosperous times before the war,
when imports were almost nil, and exports consisted only of lumber,
resin, turpentine, and farm produce. There are two approaches to the
Cape Fear River, one at the New Inlet navigable for vessels not
drawing more than 9 ft., and one at the Western Bar, between Smith and
Oak Island, where the depth varies from 9 ft. to 13 ft. To the extreme
left of Oak Island (not visible in the map) is Fort Camel; and in a
straight line with it, on Smith's Island, below Bald Head Light, is
Fort Holmes. These two forts formerly commanded the channel, and kept
the Federal cruisers at bay when chasing a blockade-runner too close
to the bar. Caswell, a very strong, casemated earthwork, has been
blown up by the Confederates, as also the batteries on Smith's Island,
and Forts Johnson and Pender, one above, the other below
Smithville. Fort Fisher, against which Admiral Porter's attack was
directed, forms the key to the channel. The inner (direct) distance
from Fort Fisher to Caswell is eight miles, but to go round by the
Frying Pan Shoals, it is sixty-two miles. The fort itself is described
as "an enormous mound of sand"; but it mounted seventy-five guns,
Brook's rifled, protected by traverses, with bombproof casemates
below. The best instance of its extraordinary strength is that it
sustained a continuous bombardment of twenty-one days, for the attack
commenced on the 14th of December and terminated only on the 14th of
January. The banks all along the river, as far as Wilmington, and some
distance beyond, are protected by formidable masked batteries; and
torpedoes and other obstructions--piles and wrecks--have been laid
down in the channel by the Confederates, to impede navigation. Even
before the arrival of the Northern armada, that portion of the river
between Fort St. Philip and Fort French required the utmost skill and
caution to pilot a vessel of any width through without running aground
or against some hidden danger. Although secret information reached
Wilmington as early as the 18th of December of the departure of the
Federal fleet from Fortress Monroe, the military authorities in
command so little expected an invasion that there were only 400
effective soldiers in the town, and a little over 200 in Fort Fisher
when the shelling began. The Federal forces are now before Half Moon
Battery, about fifteen miles below Wilmington; and, as possession of
the town is of great importance to them--it commands the high roads to
Charleston and Petersburg--they are sure to use strenuous exertions to
effect its capture; and this we may expect to hear of by next mail,
the Confederates not being prepared for hostile demonstrations in that
quarter before spring, nor able to spare sufficient troops for a
lengthened resistance.</p></div2>

Saturday, February</hi> 18, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the early part of the week came news
from America which excited legitimate hope that the combatants were
weary of the war. We were informed that agents from the South had been
empowered to meet the heads of the Federal Government, and to discuss
terms of compromise. We also learned that the authorities at
Washington had consented to receive these Confederate gentlemen, and
that a meeting had actually taken place. President Lincoln, having
previously dispatched Mr. Seward to Hampton Roads, went thither
himself, and met Messrs. Hunter, Campbell, and Stephens on board a
steamer, and it is said that their "informal conference" lasted for
four hours. The last mail confirms the intelligence that the meeting
has been without a result, and that the parties have returned to their
respective abodes.</p>
<p>We find ourselves unconsciously lingering over this detail, though
it is a vain one. How gladly should we have narrated every incident in
the history had we been able to end it with the intimation that the
heads of a treaty had been agreed upon. There was not an
honest-hearted man in England who did not hail the intelligence of the
early part of the week with satisfaction, and, indeed, with
gladness. It was felt that the period was opportune for
pacification. The Northern armies had accomplished splendid. things,
and had so triumphantly vindicated the claim of the Federals to
superiority of force that they could well afford to close the game,
and leave the South unsubdued, and proud of the gallant soldiery that
had held the capital against all corners. There was no loss of honour
to the Confederates in giving in when every one of their ports was
closed; for they were like to a brave garrison that had yielded to the
power of the assailants to draw lines all round the fortress. On the
great question of slavery, too, there seemed now but little on which
the antagonists need contend; for while the North had for the second
time confirmed the decree of freedom, the South had virtually conceded
the same boon, by preparing to place arms in the hands of the negroes
and giving them liberty in exchange for their services in the field of
battle. There remained, as we thought, an admirable subject of debate,
or <hi rend="italic">pi&#x00E8;ce de resistance</hi>, on which
treaty-makers might expend all their rhetoric and superfluous energy,
and do battle with a not unwise hypocrisy, because such discussions
would lead men's minds away from the savage feelings of war, and this
was the financial question which has been so often declared to have
been the rock on which the ship Union really split. Throwing aside
State rights and an absolute Union until the promise of peace should
have made men so resolved upon it that there could be no danger of the
failure of the negotiations, the emissaries from the South and the
authorities from Washington might have talked tariff until the minds
of all were prepared for constitutional debate and the resumption of
friendly relations.</p>
<p>It was not to be. Englishmen will again be told, both by South and
North, that we sordid islanders have never been able to attain to the
true estimate of an idea, The North will jeer us for thinking that it
would ever give up the glorious fiction of Union; the South will ask
us indignantly whether we believe that it would be content with the
fact of independence unless it had the name also. And we can only
reply that we are practical people, and are well satisfied to dispense
with names when we can have things, and that we do not care to fight
when nothing is to be gained by fighting. We know that a real Union,
such as is dreamed of by the more sanguine Federals, is an
impossibility; and that nothing can blend and fuse provinces which are
really distinct nations, with different customs, creeds and objects,
into one harmonious whole. But the honour of the North might have been
conserved by a treaty arrangement that should conserve the mighty
idea. We know that the South must, unless foreign aid be granted, ere
long succumb to the overwhelming power, numbers, and resources of its
enemies, and that it cannot, therefore, demand a formal recognition of
independence; but it has, by its gallantry, and by the terrible
obstacles which it will for a long time be able to throw in the way of
the Federals, earned the right to a real liberty, which might have
been assured to it, informally, by a little judicious diplomacy. We
may be taunted with the smallness of these views; but when we consider
that our small scheme would instantly have checked the flow of blood
and speedily have arrested the flow of treasure, while giving both
parties all that they could reasonably desire, and that the grand
ideas of each side have caused the negotiators to separate and the
signal to be given for new slaughter and new expenditure, we are not
so much ashamed of our insular pettiness as we probably ought to
be. At all events, we are anxious to assure our American brethren on
both sides that we hailed the tidings of possible peace with a
satisfaction for which some of them will not give us credit, and that
it was not a wild and childish greediness for good news that made us
receive the intelligence so eagerly. We had thought over the
situation, and perceived, as we believed, that it was far from an
unhopeful one, both champions being in honourable attitudes, and the
real causes of the war having been absorbed. We had therefore some
right to be bitterly disappointed when the second mail told us that
all has been in vain. Not quite in vain, however, for it is a good
thing that the peace idea has so far made its way that Mr. Lincoln can
meet the ambassadors of Mr. Davis. Let us hope that they may soon meet
again, and to better purpose.</p></div2>

United States mutually engaged not to fit out naval armaments upon the
Canadian lakes, also respecting the abrogation of the treaty of
commerce between the provinces of British North America and the United
States, and moved for all papers and correspondence connected with
these subjects.--Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> said he did
not intend to go into any explanations in reference to the relations
of this country with the United States, because he did not think that
such a discussion, at the present time, would be productive of any
good effect. He did not, however, consider, looking at all the
circumstances of the matter, that the notice to terminate the
convention could be construed into an exhibition of hostile feeling
towards this country. Certain things had taken place of which the
United States' Government had reason to complain; and if they could by
any means protect the property of their citizens they were surely
justified in so doing. With regard to the Reciprocity Treaty, no
official notice could be given to terminate it until the 15th of
March, when the fixed period of ten years would have
elapsed....</p>

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 11th inst., when gold
was quoted at 204 1/8.</p>
<p>President Lincoln and President Davis have both communicated to<pb
n="175"/> their respective Congresses the result of the late Peace
Conference at Fort Monroe; and they agree in stating that President
Lincoln refused to recognise in any way the Southern Confederacy, or
to make peace on any other terms than the unconditional return of the
South to the Union.</p>
<p>President Lincoln's account of the negotiations was received in
Congress on the 10th. It is of considerable length, and is very
complete in its details, narrating the circumstances of Mr. Blair's
visit to Richmond, and supplying all the despatches preliminary to the
meeting of the President with the Confederate Commissioners in Hampton
Roads, as well as giving a report of the proceedings of the Conference
itself. Though Mr. Blair went to Richmond with the consent of the
Government, he had no authority to speak or act for it. Mr. Davis sent
a letter by him expressing his willingness to send or receive
Commissioners, and Mr. Lincoln subsequently stated his willingness to
receive gentlemen informally chosen on behalf of the Confederates,
with the object of securing peace on the basis of an undivided
country. Before the Confederate commissioners were met by the
President they were given to understand that the negotiations were to
be informal, and that no proposition which in the slightest degree
contemplated a recognition of the Confederate States could be for a
moment entertained. During the conference Messrs. Stephens, Hunter,
and Campbell endeavoured to effect an agreement for an armistice, but
were informed by Mr. Lincoln that there could be no suspension of
hostilities till the Confederates had disbanded their armies and
acknowledged their allegiance to the national Government, and also
that there could be no recession on the slavery question. General
Grant had been previously instructed not to allow the presence of the
Southern agents within his lines to cause any delay in his military
operations. President Lincoln's account of the peace mission concludes
in the following terms:--</p>
<q><p>On the morning of the 3rd the three gentlemen, Messrs. Stephens,
Hunter, and Campbell, came aboard of our steamer and had an interview
with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours' duration. No
question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or
mentioned. No other person was present, no papers were exchanged or
produced, and it was in advance agreed that the conversation was to be
informal and verbal merely. On our part, the whole substance of the
instructions to the Secretary of State, herein before recited, was
stated and insisted upon, and nothing was said inconsistent therewith;
while, by the other party, it was not said that in any event or on any
condition would they ever consent to reunion; and yet they equally
omitted to declare that they would so consent. They seemed to desire a
postponement of that question, and the adoption of some other course
first, which, as some of them seemed to argue, might or might not lead
to reunion, but which course we thought would amount to an indefinite
postponement. The conference ended without result. The foregoing,
containing, as is believed, all the information sought, is
respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Executive Mansion, Feb. 10, 1865.  <hi rend="smallcaps">Abraham
Lincoln.</hi></p></q>
<p>Some of the New York journals have expressed an opinion that the
way is now opened to a further and perhaps more successful conference;
but the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, the organ of the Government,
says that "there is nothing left but a vigorous prosecution of the
war, and that, with full ranks and a full treasury, sixty days will
suffice to kill the rebellion."</p>
<p>War is equally the cry of the Confederates. At a mass meeting
convoked by the Governor of Virginia, held at Richmond, at which
President Davis was present, resolutions were unanimously passed
spurning the terms proposed by Mr. Lincoln and expressing the
determination of the Southern people to maintain the war to the last
extremity. Richmond journals scout all ideas of peace, and advocate
fighting it through. General Lee has expressed himself as
follows:--"Any compromise of our struggle would only prove a truce or
armistice, and would only be an unmanly shrinking from present duty
that would entail upon our children untold disaster." The Legislature
of Texas had passed resolutions declaring their determination to
accept no peace that did not guarantee independence.</p>
<p>General Grant's army is no longer mudbound. On the 5th inst. two
divisions of his army moved, one along the Weldon Railroad, towards
Reams station, the other to the left to Hatcher's Run, a short
distance from the Southside Railroad. The Confederates were driven
from their rifle-pits, and the Federals intrenched themselves in the
position they had won. They captured a large commissariat train. On
the 6th and 7th Grant put out his forces to the left still more, and,
though they sustained a "temporary repulse," with the loss of more
than a thousand men, they succeeded finally in establishing their
position, and occupied four miles beyond their former
lines. Substantially this is corroborated by General Lee, who adds
that General Pegram was killed. A rumour prevailed that this movement
was intended as a cover to an advance on Wilmington by General Terry,
at the head of a large force.</p>
<p>General Sherman appears to be steadily pushing forward. One of his
columns was moving on Branchville, and there was a rumour afloat
(lacking confirmation, however) to the effect that it was
taken. Another column was moving towards Charleston.</p>
<p>Movements of troops in other parts are rumoured, but nothing
definite concerning them is known.</p>
<p>An arrangement had been made for a general exchange of prisoners
between the belligerents.</p>
<p>General Lee has appealed to the Southern people for carbines,
pistols, revolvers, and saddles for the equipment of an additional
cavalry force.</p>
<p>The Confederate Senate has almost unanimously rejected the bill for
putting 20,000 negroes into the Confederate army. The Senate has also
confirmed the appointment of Mr. Breckinridge as Secretary for War;
and has passed a vote of thanks to Mr. John Lancaster, the owner of
the Deerhound, for rescuing Captain Semmes and his officers from the
Alabama.</p>
<p>Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Maine, in addition to the States
mentioned last week, have ratified the constitutional amendment
abolishing slavery; but it has been rejected by Delaware. The Governor
of Kentucky has recommended its adoption, but thinks the Government
should pay Kentucky 34,000,000 dols., the value of the slaves in that
state.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has signed the joint resolution to give England
notice of the termination of the treaty of 1817 regulating the naval
force on the lakes. The resolution is preceded by a declaration that
peace on the frontier is endangered by hostile expeditions, which the
naval forces of the two countries may be insufficient to prevent.</p>
<p>The Vice-President has officially informed the Federal Congress
that Lincoln and Johnson have been elected for four years. 213
electoral votes were cast for Lincoln and Johnson, and twenty-one for
M'Clellan and Pendleton.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Montreal Court has refused to grant further delay in the case
of the St. Albans raiders. The refusal is regarded as deciding the
case against the prisoners. Their counsel asked for delay on the
ground that the messengers sent to Richmond were unable yet to reach
their destination. It is unofficially announced that the raiders will,
if surrendered, be delivered to the authorities of Vermont for trial,
according to the State laws.</p>
<p>A mass meeting has been held at Toronto, at the call of the Mayor,
condemning the Government for passing the Alien Bill and for refunding
the money taken by the St. Albans raiders. An amendment, sustaining
the Government, was adopted by a large majority.</p></div2>

<p>....That famous Amazon of Secessia, Belle Boyd, now Mrs. Hardinge,
and whose marriage to the gallant but susceptible lieutenant whom she
converted, as Omphale converted Hercules, to Southern proclivities,
was one of the fashionable events of last season--is in London, and
proposes, it is said, to publish her memoirs as a Secesh partisan and
aide-de-camp to Stonewall Jackson. These memoirs cannot fail to be
very interesting. Belle Boyd has been the Flora Macdonald, the Madame
Lavalette, of the South, and has suffered captivity, exile, and
poverty for the cause which she believes to be the true one. It will
be <sic>gatifying</sic> to her friends to know that her husband, who was taken
prisoner while attempting to run the blockade--and who, under the
circumstances, might have expected to languish in a Federal prison
until the termination of the war--has been conditionally released, and
has rejoined his wife in England.</p>
<p>There is another American lion--for Belle Boyd deserves the nobler
gender--just now in London, and who is being lionised to the last hair
of his mane. <hi rend="italic">Il est de Marly!</hi> as they used to
say in the days of the Grand Monarque; and a grand field-day was held
in his especial honour at Aldershott last week. This lion, however,
roars from the Northern side of the hedge. His name is General Barlow,
and he is one of the youngest and bravest of the Union generals. At
the commencement of the war General Barlow was a peaceful lawyer in
New York city; but, his blood fired by the attack on Sumter, he
enlisted in the Federal army as a private; rapidly obtained promotion;
was in all the pitched battles in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania
Courthouse; captured a Confederate brigade 5000 strong; and for his
distinguished gallantry, was made a Major-General. This Paladin of the
North is a slim, beardless, well-shapen youth--just such a one as you
might picture George Brummell to have been when he was a Cornet in the
10th Hussars--and does not look six-and-twenty. But what are years to
those who are made of the heroic stuff? How old was Wellington at
Assaye, and Napoleon at Arcola?</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Zoological Society of London have
lately purchased of a London dealer in wild animals the only specimen,
it is believed, yet brought to England of the Prong-horned Antelope
(Antilope furcifer), which is commonly known in North America by the
name of the "Cabree goat." This animal is never found east of the
Mississippi, but inhabits the great western prairies of North America,
from the 53rd deg. of latitude to the plains of Mexico and California,
and was formerly numerous in the country watered by the Saskatchewan
River; frequenting the open plains and hills, but never inhabiting the
closely-wooded districts. During the winter, however, it migrates from
north to south, and returns in the warmer season. It is now becoming
scarce in most parts. Its ordinary<pb n="184"/> size, when full grown,
is about 3 ft. high and 4 ft. 4 in. long from the nose to the tip of
the tail. The body is covered with long hair, which loses its
elasticity in cold weather; there is an erect mane upon the neck; the
head, ears, and legs are clothed with short, close hair, of a common
description. The colour is generally a light fawn colour; except the
white stripes across the throat and about the legs and tail. The horns
rise perpendicularly from the skull, immediately above the eyes; they
spread outwards and are straight till within two or three inches of
the points, where they curve suddenly backwards and inwards, forming a
small hook; the prong, which is little more than an inch in length,
projects from the front of the horn, about half way up from the root;
the lower part of the horn, below the prong, is rough and of a
flattish shape; above the prong it is round, black, and polished. The
specimen now in the gardens of the society in Regent's Park is a young
male, which was brought from California to New York, and thence
re-exported to England.</p></div2>

<p>By the Inman steam-ship City of London, we have news from New York
to the 18th ult., when gold was quoted at 104&#x00BD; per cent
premium.</p>
<p>General Sherman occupied Branchville on the 8th ult. According to
the statement of a Federal courier, who was said to have left General
Sherman's army and to have ridden across the country to Smithville,
near the mouth of Cape Fear River, the occupation of Branchville was
preceded by three days' hard fighting; but the Richmond journals made
no mention of any battle, merely announcing that Branchville was
abandoned because the Federals had occupied Orangeburg, and that
General Beauregard had taken up a new line for the purpose of covering
Columbia. The latest accounts from Richmond stated that the vanguard
of General Sherman's army had reached the south bank of the Congaree
River at a point a few miles east of Columbia; that the Confederates
had fallen back to the north bank of the stream, and that a battle was
imminent. A steamer, under a flag of truce, had brought from Richmond
rumours (not very trustworthy) that General Sherman had been checked
and General Beauregard killed.</p>
<p>Nothing important had occurred in the neighbourhood of Richmond or
Petersburg. General Grant was busily engaged in fortifying his new
position at Hatcher's Run. He has extended his pickets to Shiney
Creek.</p>
<p>The Federals were continuing their operations against
Wilmington. General Terry had made three attacks on the Confederate
lines at Sugarloaf, north of Cape Fear River, all of which, though
assisted by the whole of Porter's fleet, were repulsed by the
Confederates. The result of a reconnaissance at Wilmington was, we are
told, the advance of the Federal lines three miles. The new ground was
held and works thrown up on it as strong as those to which the
Confederates had retreated. Lieutenant Cushing made another
reconnaissance to the obstructions opposite Fort Anderson, crossed the
obstructions, passed up to Wilmington, and made a complete examination
of the wharves and shipping. He also proceeded to Charlotte, North
Carolina, and destroyed all the provisions there.</p>
<p>Three thousand Federals had effected a landing at James Island,
within three miles of Charleston. The object of the movement was
unknown.</p>
<p>General Thomas had arrived in New Orleans; but it was not known how
large a part of his army he had taken with him, or whether his
operations were to be directed against Mobile or against Texas.</p>
<p>At the great war meeting held in Richmond Mr. Benjamin, the
Secretary of State, delivered a speech strongly enforcing the
necessity of employing negroes as Confederate soldiers. The Richmond
Senate, however, has taken a different view of affairs; and, while
that body has decided upon the employment of 40,000 negroes in a
menial capacity in the army, it has voted down the proposal to arm two
hundred thousand of them.</p>
<p>The plan of the new Confederate flag, submitted some time ago by
Major Rogers for the consideration of Congress, has been adopted by
the Military Committee of the House and Senate, and will henceforth be
the national emblem of the Confederate States. The change made in the
flag consists in the division of the field into a white bar and a red
bar in equal proportion, the red bar being at the outer end of the
field.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has called an <sic>extrordinary</sic> session of the Senate
for the 4th of March, "to receive and act upon such communications as
may be made on the part of the Executive."</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden has submitted to the Committee of Ways and Means a
financial plan for the next fiscal year. It provides for the issue of
a loan of 600,000,000 dols. in such form of bonds and such rates of
interest, not exceeding 6 per cent, as may seem most advisable to the
Secretary. The total public debt on Feb. 1 is officially announced at
2,000,153,000,000 dols.; the total interest is 98,130,000 dols.</p>
<p>The Federal House of Representatives had passed a bill imposing a
duty of &#x00BD; per cent on all sales and an internal revenue tax of
eight cents per pound on cotton.</p>
<p>The Senate has refused an appropriation for the Niagara Ship
Canal.</p>
<p>Congress has passed a bill for the establishment of a mail
steam-ship line between San Francisco and China.</p>
<p>Captain Beales, concerned in the Lake Erie affair, and sentenced
to be hanged, has been respited.</p>
<p>Minnesota and Kansas have ratified the constitutional amendment,
making fifteen States who have adopted it. The majority report of the
judiciary committee of the Kentucky State Senate recommends the
rejection of the constitutional amendment. The minority report insists
on compensation as a condition to precede the ratification.</p>

<p>The following telegrams have been received through Mr. Reuter's
office:--</p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the arrival of the St. David (vi&#x00E2; Greencastle) we have
received the following intelligence dated New York, Feb. 18,
Evening:--</p>
<p>General Grant reports to Mr. Stanton this evening that to-day's <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Despatch</hi> says Sherman entered and took
possession of Columbia yesterday morning. General Beauregard
communicated this intelligence officially yesterday. From his despatch
it appears that the Federals shelled Columbia on Thursday from the
south bank of the Congaree. During the night they moved up the river,
and on the following morning forded the Soluda and Broad
Rivers. During the Federal passage of these rivers, Beauregard
evacuated Columbia. The Federals soon after took possession. Two days
previously, when it was decided not to attempt the defence of
Columbia, a large quantity of medicinal stores was destroyed. The
despatch presumes that the fall of Columbia will necessitate the
evacuation of Charleston, which the despatch thinks has already
commenced.</p>
<p>The general impression is that Sherman will now proceed to
Charleston to establish his base; but the <hi
rend="italic">Despatch</hi> does not see what need he has of a
base. He subsists on the country, and his army has not been exhausted
by any battle. Since he left Savannah, Sherman declared his intention
to march to Columbia, thence to Augusta, and thence to
Charleston. This Beauregard considers was uttered as a boast to hide
his designs. The <hi rend="italic">Despatch</hi> thinks that he will
next strike at Charlotte or at Florence. It was reported yesterday
that the Federals had captured Augusta; but the <hi
rend="italic">Despatch</hi> discredits the report.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Charleston Mercury</hi> announced a temporary
suspension on Saturday, with the view to its removal to another point,
this being rendered necessary by the progress of military events.</p>
<p>Captain Semmes has been made a Rear-Admiral, with the command of
the James River squadron. Gold, 204.</p>
<p>Philadelphia papers announce that the Richmond papers of Thursday
state that Sherman's main columns had reached Kingsville Junction,
twenty-five miles north-east of Columbia. The communication south of
the Florence Railroad and on the Charleston Railroad is
interrupted.</p>
<p>A Confederate flag-of-truce boat has been blown up on the James
River. All on board were lost.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the Tariff Bill, and
rejected the proposition to tax sales of merchandise. Mr. Stevens's
proposed tax of 10 per cent upon gold sales has been defeated.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">CANADA</hi>.--Quebec, Feb. 17.--The House in
Committee has sanctioned the appropriation of 330,000 dols. for the
expenses of the arrangements on the frontier to prevent raids. It has
also appropriated 50,000 dols. on account of the money refunded to the

<p rend="center">THE FEDERAL OCCUPATION OF<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">CHARLESTON.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> evacuation of Charleston, South
Carolina, by the Confederates is one of the most startling events of a
campaign which has presented a long succession of surprises. The
fact, regarded from a military point of view, is not, perhaps, so
important as the capture of Fort Fisher; yet we can hardly wonder that
the announcement of it stirred a deeper feeling of satisfaction in the
North than any that has shown itself during the progress of the
war. The few observations we shall make on it will have reference
rather to its moral than to its military or its political
bearings. The object of the struggle at its present stage is no longer
what it was at its commencement, so far, at least, as the South is
concerned. When the first gun was fired against Fort Sumter, there can
be no doubt that the seceding States contemplated founding an
extensive and extending empire, of which<pb n="222"/> their peculiar
and, as they affirmed, necessary institution was to have been an
important element. Such an object, however, it is impossible that the
Confederacy can any longer entertain with hope. Slavery, as a social
system, has so far suffered by the collision of the two sections of
the American people that its extinction, at no very distant date, is
morally certain. Such being the case, although the issue of the
contest may involve principles to which our Transatlantic kinsmen,
whether of the North or South, attach high importance, we, as distant
spectators, seeing that the broad interests of humanity are no longer
at stake, may be excused for doubting whether the cost of further
strife will not far exceed the ends proposed to be gained by it, and
for wishing that we may soon witness the end of bloodshed and
devastation. We know not how the fall of Charleston may affect the
final balance of political power on the continent of America, nor do
we pretend to be competent to foresee its strategical effects; but
there is one point of view from which the event may be regarded which
is full of instruction and which is worth serious consideration.</p>
<p>Charleston may be said to have precipitated this war. It cannot, it
is true, be proved that but for South Carolina, of which the city of
Charleston was the heart, Mr. Lincoln's election in 1860 might not
have led to the eventual secession of the Slave States; but, at least,
it should be borne in mind that South Carolina set the example. She
did so, not by accident, but on calculation. Her temper had inclined
her in that direction for many years past. She had used her readiness
to secede as a threat on former occasions whenever her selfwill had
been crossed by President or Congress. By means of it she strove to
overbear all legitimate opposition. We neither affirm nor deny her
right as a State to take the position she did; but we note the fact
that she asserted that right with inconsiderate haste. For awhile, the
policy of which she may be said to have been not merely the advocate
but the author was accepted by the majority of the people of the
United States, and none insisted upon submission to the decisions of
that majority, when they chanced to be with her, more loudly than
South Carolina. Then came the memorable election of 1860, by which the
political supremacy of the South was, for the time being at any rate,
broken and overturned. What might have followed that popular victory
had it been accepted we can only conjecture; but the election itself
could hardly be regarded as an invasion of the sovereignty of the
Southern States. Not a single act had yet been done, not a profession
had yet been made, inimical to State rights, when South Carolina
declared for secession, and was soon followed in that course by
several of her sister States. Her precipitancy was looked upon in the
North with wonder and, for a time, with forbearance. Ordinary
patience, tact, and statesmanship on the part of Secessia might
probably then have secured her ends without the exchange of a single
shot: for there was not then such a show of angry temper in the North
as forbade the South to believe that a peaceful separation might be
practicable.</p>
<p>Things were in this critical but not altogether hopeless position
when Charleston took into her own hands to bring to an abrupt decision
the alternative of peace or war. She assailed Fort Sumter, and from
that act what a long train of miseries has proceeded! What a sea of
tears and blood has resulted from that first concussion! What an
avalanche of destruction has been brought down upon both sections of
the theretofore prosperous republic! What a huge conflagration of
passion has been kindled! For all these things South Carolina made
herself responsible. Thousands upon thousands of men and women on both
sides, who had no participation in that act, but upon whom the
terrible consequences have fallen, have since bewailed the impatience
and imperious pride that needlessly and almost gaily flung back the
floodgates of devouring war, which from that moment to this none have
been able to close, and through which an inundation of woe has swept
to cover the face of the land, with wreck and death.</p>
<p>Remembering all this, one cannot wonder that the fall of Charleston
has sent a thrill of sensation through the North, nor that the
officers of the Federal Government took possession of the already
ruined city with a feeling of satisfaction that poetic justice had at
length overtaken her. We cannot pretend to be conscious of that
feeling. We know too well how, in all such calamities, the innocent
suffer with the guilty; and how, not the perpetrators of the crime
alone, but also those who would have prevented it if they could, share
the doom which it has entailed. But we do see in the retribution which
has befallen Charleston enough to make us pause and ponder. It does
present to our minds some suggestions, wholly uncoloured by party
feeling, to which we think attention may be profitably given.</p>
<p>The old proverb says, "Curses, like chickens, come home to roost."
The experience of mankind, condensed into these few words, discloses
to us one of the laws which characterise the moral government of the
world. Those who rely on the power of cursing--or, otherwise
expressed, on words of menace, outbursts of passion, and impatient and
angry self-assertion--rely upon the reed which, when it breaks,
pierces the hands of such as lean upon it. South Carolina, on any
question into which her passions entered, disdained reasoning. An
overbearing reiteration of her will was her main argument. Her social
structure had nurtured in her habits of despotic command, and she
freely expressed them. It will not do. It never has done. It is as
certain of bringing round its own retribution as it is that what men
sow they will reap. The fate of Charleston, now desolate and in ruins,
is but another historical illustration, added to many foregoing ones,
that reason, law, and justice cannot be set at defiance, by however
strong a will, with ultimate impunity.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note, moreover, that to Charleston has been denied
the gratification of falling heroically. Her children were quite as
brave as others; but circumstances conspired to render her fate an
inglorious one. She who fired the first gun in this awful war was
finally taken possession of in a manner humiliating to her pride. No
one will forget her successful defence of herself at an earlier
period; yet no one will associate with her end a sentiment of
enthusiastic admiration. Almost before Europe has given a week's
reflection to the announcement of her having been abandoned, the fact
is almost lost sight of, having been obliterated by the later tidings
that South Carolina is being traversed by an army of her foe, not
merely unresisted, but seemingly unmenaced, by her inhabitants.</p>
<p>Yet, one can hardly doubt that Charleston, prostrate as she is,
will rise up, and enter upon a better future. Her geographical
position will ever make her the chief maritime outlet for the
productions of the South. Cotton and tobacco will still be grown when
slavery has ceased. She has paid the penalty of her own mistake. Her
ruins will be repaired. Her grass-grown streets will once again
resound with traffic. Her waters will be crowded with the ships of all
nations. And her last state of prosperity will, we devoutly trust,
bury her first in forgetfulness.</p></div2>

<p>We have news from New York to the 22nd ult,, at which time gold was
quoted at 201&#x00BD;.</p>
<p>Charleston, the capital of South Carolina, has been surrendered. We
were able to announce this fact in a portion of our Impression last
week. This city, the most important, next to New Orleans, of the
Southern seaports, where the first shot of the war was fired, and
which for nearly four years set at defiance the whole power of the
Northern navy, assisted by a considerable land force, is now
garrisoned by Federal troops. Charleston was evacuated by the
Confederates on the night of the 17th and occupied by the Federals on
the morning of the 18th ult.</p>
<p>In April 1861, Fort Sumter, at that time occupied by a Federal
garrison, was besieged by the people of Charleston, and surrendered
after a bombardment of some hours, but which occasioned no loss of
life. From that time till the 18th of February, 1865, the flag of the
United States never waved either on the forts or in the town. Animated
in part by feelings of vengeance and partly by a desire to gain one of
the principal Confederate seaport towns, the North spared no efforts
to gain possession of Charleston. Expedition after expedition was
dispatched with this object, ironclads were built expressly to run the
gauntlet of the fire from the forts by which the entrance to the
harbour was protected, and even cannon were invented and new engines
of destruction designed for the special purpose of raining fire on the
city which had so provoked the Federal wrath. But ironclads, Parrott
guns, and Greek fire were alike useless. When the city was evacuated
the Federal fleet was beyond the range of Fort Sumter, and the
besieging army was peaceably encamped behind its
intrenchments. Charleston was abandoned because the successes of a
General who had never appeared before its walls rendered the step
necessary, and the ironclads entered its harbour and General Gilmore's
forces occupied its streets without firing or receiving a shot.</p>
<p>On the 15th ult. Sherman appeared before Columbia, and, having
bombarded the town from the south side of the river on which it
stands, it was surrendered without a struggle. On the following day
the outposts of the Federal army reached the Kingsville Junction,
twenty miles north-east of Columbia, and thus secured possession of
the railroads communicating with the eastern portions of South
Carolina.</p>
<p>Intelligence of these events having been transmitted to Charleston,
the evacuation of that town was effected on the night of the 17th
ult., and on the following morning the Federal troops entered, without
opposition. The guns, to the number of two hundred, with which the
fortifications were armed, fell into the hands of the Federals, after,
however, having been spiked, and a considerable quantity of ammunition
also became prize of war. The retreating Confederates, however, left
as little for the enemy as they could possibly help. They set fire to
the arsenals, quartermaster's stores, and cotton d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;ts,
blew up their ironclads and other vessels in the dockyards, and
destroyed the railway bridges leading from the town. The upper portion
of the city was also intentionally, or accidentally, set in flames,
and 6000 bales of cotton are supposed to have been burnt. The
Confederate forces had quitted the city before the besiegers entered,
and no attempt was made to molest them in their retreat. The motives
which led to the abandonment of Charleston are manifest. Cut off from
the rest of the Confederacy, its capture became inevitable, and its
abandonment furnished the only way by which the army to which its
defence was intrusted could be saved from destruction. The
Confederates, after leaving the place, retreated in a north-westerly
direction.</p>
<p>Meantime Sherman was pushing his advantage in the centre of<pb
n="223"/> South Carolina. Beauregard, on leaving Columbia, retreated
rapidly towards Charlotte, a railway centre in North Carolina, about
eighty-five miles nearly due north of Columbia. Sherman's column lost
no time in following the Confederates up, and at last accounts was
thirty miles north of Columbia.</p>
<p>At Wilmington, too, the Federals have been successful. On the 10th
of February General Schofield, assisted by Admiral Porter, assaulted
and carried Fort Anderson, the garrison making good their retreat. The
fall of Wilmington, we are told, appeared certain.</p>
<p>From Newbern and various other points strong forces have started to
operate on the railways, and in Western Virginia another raid was
preparing. In Alabama General Thomas was, it is said, making
arrangements to prevent Hood's army from going to the Carolinas. Some
10,000 men have, however, left to reinforce Beauregard.</p>
<p>No active movements had taken place before Petersburg, but a strong
impression prevailed that Lee would evacuate that place and fall back
to Lynchburg, where he would be joined by Beauregard and such other
Confederate forces as could make their way to him.</p>

<p>The Upper House of the Canadian Parliament has voted, by forty-five
to fifteen, in favour of the confederation scheme. An address will be
presented to the Queen based upon the resolutions of the
Conference.</p>
<p>The Legislative Assembly, while in Committee of Supply, voted,
without a division, 50,000 dols. for the purpose of reimbursing the
St. Albans banks for the losses they sustained by the Confederate
raiders.</p></div2>

able. "Virginia, First and Last," is no doubt by Mr. Conway, whose
able contributions to this magazine we have before had occasion to
notice. The writer's situation is peculiar, he being, at the same
time, a patriotic Virginian and one of the most determined opponents
of slavery, in America or out of it. His love for his native State is
pathetically evident in his description of Virginian homes in the good
old times, while he does not disguise the deterioration which has
followed the unhappy day when, some thirty years since, Virginia
definitively united her fortunes with the Slaveholding States, and
excluded the liberal and humanising culture of New England. According
to Mr. Conway, the actuating principle of Virginia and the Carolinas
is the assertion of State rights, and consequent dissolution of a
Union which has become incompatible with them, while the rest of the
revolted States regard the destruction of the Union as a means to an
end, and that end the propagation of slavery. He seems to foreshadow a
breach between the allies on this account....</p></div2>

<p>Our latest news from New York, by the Nova Scotian, is to the
morning of the 5th inst.</p>
<p>In President Lincoln's Inaugural Address, which we give on another
column, there is, it will be seen, no indication of any change of
policy.</p>
<p>The great blockade-running city of Wilmington, as stated to a
considerable portion of our Impression last week, passed into Federal
occupation on the 22nd ult., Washington's birthday. From Admiral
Porter's official despatches we learn that General Schofield, now in
command of the Federal military in that quarter, advanced, on the 17th
ult., from Smithville, four vessels of the fleet simultaneously
attacking and enfilading the works. The wind and tide prevented more
vessels from participating in the engagement. Fort Anderson answered
pretty briskly, but quieted down by sunset. During the night the
Confederates sent 200 floating torpedoes down the river, but Porter
sunk them by musketry. One torpedo entered and blew up the wheel-house
of the Osceola, and knocked down the bulkheads. No damage however, was
done to the hull. Porter spread fishing-nets across the river. Next
morning Porter advanced with the greater part of the fleet. A heavy
fire was maintained silencing the Confederate batteries by three
p.m. Porter, however, continued the fire until dark, and also through
the night, and in the mean time Schofield was working in the
rear. "While the fleet maintained a heavy fire upon the fort,"
Schofield says, "I pressed the enemy on both sides of the river, and
sent Cox sixteen miles round the swamp to the enemy's right. Cox
proceeded along the narrow defile between the two swamps, and
completely turned the enemy's position. The enemy, discovering the
movement, abandoned the works and retreated to Wilmington. The guns
captured are uninjured. Fifty prisoners were taken. The loss was
small, on each side." It is stated that the Confederate shot made no
impression on the Federal monitors, although but a third of a mile
from the fort. The southern face of the fort, however, was "badly
disfigured." The Federals sent a sham monitor, constructed of canvas,
up the river with the tide to explode torpedoes. It floated past the
fort, and is supposed to have hastened its evacuation, the
Confederates believing the water communication gone. Immediately upon
the evacuation of Fort Anderson, Schofield directed Cox, one of his
subordinates, to follow the garrison towards Wilmington. The
Confederates made a stand behind Town Creek; but on the 20th Cox
crossed the river below them on flat boats, attacked their rear, and
routed them, taking two guns and 300 prisoners. On the 21st Cox pushed
on to Brunswick River, opposite Wilmington, where the bridges were on
fire on his arrival. The Southerners had begun burning cotton and
resin in the city, and left it that night. Citizens state that 1000
bales of cotton and 15,000 barrels of resin were burned. Northern
accounts say that "Union feeling showed itself strongly in the
city."</p>
<p>Sherman has burnt Columbia--in retaliation, it is said, for his
troops having been fired upon after they entered the city. The
Southern papers charge the Federal General with having bombarded the
town without giving warning of his intention to do so. Such accounts
as we have of General Sherman's movements are obscure and
contradictory. On the one hand, it appears to have been reported in
New York that General Sherman had marched in an easterly direction,
and had effected a junction with General Schofield, on the 27th ult.,
at some place not named. On the other hand, it seems to have been
stated by the Richmond newspapers that General Sherman was moving
against Raleigh, the capital of North Carolina, and had left the
Confederate army, under its new Commander-in-Chief, General Joseph
Johnston (who has superseded Beauregard), in his rear, at
Charlotte. There are rumours by the last mail of a battle, and of
Sherman and Schofield having been checked.</p>
<p>Southern papers continue to speak confidently of the safety of
Richmond and of Lee's ability to withstand any movement made by
Grant. On the other hand, there are statements that preparations for
the evacuation of the place have begun. It is said that Grant was
preparing for a new movement, but that the weather interfered with his
plans. General Grant states that since May last 17,000 deserters have
come over to him from the Confederate army. According to the Richmond
papers Grant's troops north of the James River have been moved to the
left and massed with the rest of his army in the vicinity of Hatcher's
Run.</p>
<p>The proposition to arm 200,000 negroes passed the Confederate House
of Representatives on the 20th ult.; but it was indefinitely postponed
by the Senate on the following day, by a majority of one. The <hi
rend="italic">Richmond Dispatch</hi> thinks the bill will be
reconsidered and passed. Opinion at the South seems evenly balanced on
the subject. General Lee has expressed his opinion that the employment
of slaves in the army is both expedient and necessary, on the ground
that the white population alone cannot supply the necessities of a
long war; and recommends that a call for those who will volunteer upon
the condition of their freedom be immediately authorised by the
Southern Congress. The message of the Governor of Georgia opposes the
arming of the slaves. They do not wish to enter the army. They will
desert by thousands. The Governor, it is said, denounces violently the
military and civil policy of President Davis, which, if persisted in,
he says, must terminate in reconstruction, with or without
subjugation.</p>
<p>A bill has passed the Confederate House of Representatives, in
secret Session, authorising the arming of negroes tendered by owners,
and also authorising the President to call upon each State, whenever
expedient, for a quota of 300,000 troops, irrespective of colour, in
addition to those subject to military service under existing laws. The
relations of slaves and masters remain unchanged, except by consent of
the owners in States where slaves reside.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress have expelled Senator Foote.</p>
<p>The Virginia Senate has authorised the Governor to call for
volunteers among the slaves and free negroes of the State for the
defence of Richmond and other points threatened. They are to be
organised into infantry companies for the year's service, under white
officers, and to be placed at the disposal of the
General-in-Chief.</p>
<p>Governor Vance, in a proclamation to the people of North Carolina,
declares that the only dangers that threaten the cause of Southern
independence are the depression consequent upon recent reverses and
the risk of internal dissension. The muster-rolls of the Confederacy
show the record of 400,000 soldiers, but thousands upon thousands of
them are absent without leave. To entreat, to put to shame, or to
drive these men back to the defence of their country's standard is the
business of the hour.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has approved the Fortifications Bill, the
appropriations for which have been reduced to half their original
amount.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives has passed the 600,000,000 dols. Loan
Bill.</p>
<p>The Senate has adopted the amendment increasing the duty on
tobacco, snuff, cigars, and cheroots. It has also passed the House
Bill taxing sales &#x00BD; per cent.</p>
<p>New Jersey had refused to ratify the constitutional amendment.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>We have news from Quebec to Feb. 24.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council have got rapidly through with the debate on
the confederation scheme, having closed the discussion of that measure
on Monday, Feb. 20, when the motion in favour thereof was carried by a
vote of 45 to 15.</p>
<p>The discussion of the proposed new Constitution continues nightly
in the Lower House.</p>
<p>The resumption of the trial of the St. Albans raiders took place in
Montreal on Monday, Feb. 20, when the court was thronged with
spectators. Mr. Kerr opened the argument for the defence, and was
followed by Mr. Laflamme on the same side. On Tuesday the latter
counsel was to continue his arguments against the extradition of the
prisoners, but, owing to the indisposition of Judge Smith, the Court
did not sit on that day. The investigation is creating vast
excitement. Mr. Kerr submitted to the Court a series of printed
propositions, seventeen in number, with authorities sustaining
them.</p>
<p>Mr. F. W. Torrance, barrister, of Montreal, has opened his
commission of inquiry into the conduct of Judge Coursol in dismissing
the St. Albans raiders. Mr. Henry Stuart, Q.C., applied to be
admitted to watch the case for his client, which the Commissioner
declined to allow. The Hon. Mr. Letellier brought the matter before
the notice of the Upper Chamber by inquiring of the Government whether
it was by their instructions that the Commissioner was proceeding <hi
rend="italic">ex parte</hi> and with closed doors. In reply. Sir
E. P. Tach&#x00E9; stated that Mr. Torrance was only acting in virtue
of his commission, that he had received no instructions, and was
carrying on the inquiry according to law.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">PRESIDENT LINCOLN'S INAUGURAL ADDRESS.</p>
<p>The following is the full text of President Lincoln's inaugural
address, received on Thursday night through Mr. Reuter's office:--</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fellow-Countrymen</hi>.--At this second
appearance to take the oath of the Presidential office there is less
occasion for an extended address than at the first. Then, a statement,
somewhat in detail, of the course to be pursued seemed very fitting
and proper; now, at the expiration of four years, during which public
declarations have constantly been called forth concerning every point
and phase of the great contest which still absorbs attention and
engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be
presented.</p>
<p>The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is
as well known to the public as to myself. It is, I trust, reasonably
satisfactory and encouraging to all with a high hope for the
future. No prediction in that regard is ventured. On the occasion
corresponding to this four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously
directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it; all sought to
avoid it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this
place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, the
insurgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war,
seeking to dissolve the union and divide the effects, by
negotiating. Both parties deprecated war; but one of them would make
war rather than let the Union perish; and war came. One eighth of the
whole population were coloured slaves; not distributed generally over
the Union, but located in the Southern part. These slaves constituted
a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew the interest would,
somehow, cause war. To strengthen, perpetuate, and extend this
interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the Union
by war, while the Government claimed no right to do more than restrict
the territorial enlargement of it. Neither party expected the
magnitude or duration which it has already attained; neither
anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease even before the
conflict itself should cease. Each looked for an easier triumph and a
result less fundamental and astonishing. Both read the same Bible and
pray to the same God. Each invokes His aid against the other. It may
seem strange that any man should dare to ask a just God's assistance
in wringing bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us
judge not, that we be not judged. The prayer of both should not be
answered; and neither has been answered fully, for the Almighty has
his own purposes. "Woe unto the world because of offences, for it must
needs be that offence come, but woe unto that man by whom the offence
cometh!" If we suppose American slavery one of these offences which in
the providence of God must needs come, but which, having continued
through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives
to both North and South this terrible war, as due to them by whom the
offence came, shall we discern that there is any departure from those
Divine attributes which believers in the living God always ascribe to
Him? Fondly do we hope, fervently, do we pray, that this mighty
scourge of war may speedily pass away; yet if it be God's will that it
continue until the wealth piled by bondsmen by 250 years' unrequited
toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash
shall be paid by another drawn by the sword, as was said 3000 years
ago, so still it must be said that the judgments of the Lord are true
and righteous. With malice towards none, with charity for all, with
firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive
on to finish the work we are engaged in; to bind up the nation's
wounds; to care for the man who shall have borne the battle, and for
the widow and orphans; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just
and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.</p></div2>

Saturday, March</hi> 18, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> most interesting, as well as the most
important, debate which has marked the present Session took place on
Monday last, when Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald, calling attention to the
report of Colonel Jervois on the defences of Canada, brought up "the
American question." Several of the best speakers in the house took
part in the discussion, and the Commons were occupied upon it until
near midnight, the Premier closing the debate. It was, generally
speaking, conducted in a manner which showed that the House had a due
sense of the weight which would attach to the deliberate utterances of
the British House of Representatives. The report is now on its way to
the West, and it will be interesting to know how it will have affected
American readers. The declaration of the friends of the Federals that
the newspapers of the States are not to be respected, as they do not
represent the feeling of the people, may as well be borne in mind when
we are told, as we unquestionably shall be, that the British are
showing their terror of the great and glorious armies which the
crushing of the rebellion will liberate, and probably dispatch to
rectify an account which requires stern overhauling.</p>
<p>We do not suppose that an honest American reader of the debate,
however much he may fancy he dislikes England, will perceive any signs
of terror in the great debate, We are expressly told, on both sides of
the House, that there is no reason to believe that the Federals
propose to break the peace. Lord Palmerston assures us of the friendly
character of the relations between the Government at Washington and
our own; but his words are those which a Minister is bound to use
until a rupture takes place, and too nearly resemble the assurances of
peace which we received within a very short time of the declaration of
war with Russia, to derive very great importance from the position of
the speaker. Mr. Disraeli, like the celebrated German who had never
seen a camel but nevertheless described one, evolved a Federal out of
his own moral consciousness, and, having constructed the being, cited
Aristotle to show that Lincoln would not invade Canada. The leader of
the Opposition assumed, and sustained with great skill, a calm,
philosophic tone in regard to America; and argued, from a lofty
height, and as if with a bird's-eye view of affairs, that we need not
apprehend war, though it was just and necessary to state that our
Government was not to be thanked for our security. But Mr. Bright, who
may be regarded as the member for Federalia, and who represents
American views far more faithfully than those of any large number of
Englishmen, would not be content with any formalism or any
philosophy. He was, or seemed to be, more angry than he usually
appears and, while peace was his theme, he thundered over it as if he
were proclaiming war. Mr. Bright contended that England had behaved
ill to the Federals in recognising the South, in taking a high tone in
the Trent affair, and in permitting the Alabama and other
English-built vessels to ravage the seas. That was the guilt of the
Government. The educated classes had behaved ill in admiring the
valour of the slaveowners and in rejoicing at their successful
resistance. The press had behaved ill in recording its belief that the
Confederates would make a long defence, and might ultimately establish
their independence, and, moreover, in describing the victories which
they had gained. Lord Russell was let off easily, though his
declaration that the triumph of the North would be good neither for
the negroes nor for humanity is on permanent record. Mr. Bright--and
we have noted his words at some length because he is the American
advocate--is instructed to say that there is "no fear of war."</p>
<p>These were the statements of the three men who represent opposed
opinions, and, for different reasons, they all agree that at present
there is no cause to apprehend a rupture. The allegation by Mr. Seward
that at the Hampton Roads conference the Confederates proposed to make
peace, and then that North and South should fall on Canada, is eagerly
repudiated by the Richmond press, and we are assured that it was not
upon Canada, but upon Mexico, that it was proposed to fall, and that
the French, not the English, were to be expelled from the New
World. This may or may not be. If we have to express our opinion, it
would be that, had the North seen its way to any war at all, the South
would not have been particular as to the direction in which the
reunited stars should travel; nor have we done anything to deserve the
affection of the South. The Emperor of the French will, doubtless,
take into consideration the amiable readiness of the Confederates to
overturn the new Mexican Empire. He is, in fact, in much the same
position as ourselves in regard to America. If Canada be attacked, we
shall certainly support her with the whole force which Great Britain
can bring to bear; and if the Canadian frontier be indefensible, that
is also the case with several points in another frontier, which it is
not necessary to name. If Mexico be attacked, the honour of France is
pledged to maintain, for some years at least, the empire which she has
founded, and which will be an invaluable boon to a country which was
never free, by reason of the numerous bloodthirsty and corrupt
tyrannies which rendered Mexico a by-word among nations. The American
reader of our debates will perceive that our statesmen of all parties
are fully aware of all the bearings of the case, and we think that the
speeches of the responsible orators will show that "rowdy rhetoric"
has produced no effect upon the tempers of Englishmen, and that we do
not accept the scoffs of vulgar writers as the expression of American
opinion. And, above all, and amid all, and beneath all will be found,
we hope, the resistless current of a noble faith--namely, the belief
that Providence will not permit the despots of the world to enjoy the
humiliating spectacle of the two great free nations of the earth, the
mighty champions of civilisation and progress, engaged in hideous
grapple, instead of leading in majestic union the march of mankind
towards better things than can be gained by war.</p></div2>

<p>....It was not to be taken as a necessity that a great debate on
the policy of this country towards the United States was involved in
Mr. Seymour Fitzgerald's motion on the defences of Canada. It would
have been quite possible to keep the discussion within the narrow
circle of military administration; but it would seem that this
opportunity was skilfully employed to promulgate opinions and indicate
a policy on the part of the leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons, and to neutralise the bounceability of the chief of the
Opposition in the House of Lords in reference to Anglo-American
affairs. With considerable dexterity Mr. Fitzgerald contrived to
impeach the Government for not preparing to defend Canada to the
uttermost, and at the same time to insinuate a belief in the best and
most peaceful intentions on the part of the United States, a feeling
which, if he happened to get into the Foreign Office, was to be
cherished and, if possible, expanded....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Monday.</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Defences Of Canada.--Our
Relations With America.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Seymour Fitzgerald</hi> brought under
notice the report of Colonel Jervois with reference to the defences of
Canada, and called attention generally to the state of that colony in
the event of an attack by the Federal States of America. The
hon. gentleman observed that in his opinion the Federal Government
were quite justified in giving notice of their intention to terminate
the mutual arrangement with regard to the naval strength of both
Powers on the lakes; but that he thought we ought to have met the
Government of Washington and to have proposed a temporary increase of
the naval police. Had this been done the Federal Government would, in
all probability, never have given us notice of the termination of the
convention. Again, with regard to the notice to put an end to the
Reciprocity Treaty, that notice might have been given in a moment of
irritation, and he could not but think that if we had said to
Mr. Seward, "Do not precipitately put an end to a treaty which has
hitherto worked so well; but point out to us how we can meet your
views and we will endeavour to modify the treaty with that end,"
matters might have been arranged satisfactorily. Looking at the
experience of the past, as exhibited in the Trent affair, he thought
it would be idle of us to shut our eyes to the imminence of a quarrel,
at no remote period, with the Federal States. He believed that if
Canada were independent she would have nothing to fear from the
Northern States. But she was not independent, and, so long as she
desired to maintain her connection with the mother country, we were
bound in honour to stand by her. Under these circumstances, he warned
the Government to take active steps to counteract the efforts which
the Northern States were now making for the contingency of war with
England. What, he asked, were we doing for the defence of Quebec, and
for placing gun-boats on the internal waters of America. He considered
that we were bound at once to communicate with the Canadian
Government, with a view to putting the colony in a defensive
state. This would strengthen the prospects of peace; and if,
unhappily, war should break out, we would have the satisfaction of
knowing that we had done our best towards maintaining the honour of
England untarnished. Prompt and vigorous action was absolutely
necessary, and he hoped that the Government would not hesitate a
moment in taking it.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">W. E. Forster</hi> expressed a hope that
the Government would give a full and frank reply with reference not
only to the relations between Canada and the United States, but also
with respect to ourselves and the Government of Washington. He
admitted that there was apprehension out of doors with reference to
our future relations with America, but, in his opinion, they were
absolutely groundless. In support of this argument he reminded the
House of the absurd panic of a French invasion which had disturbed the
propriety of the country a few years since, and which we were all now
thoroughly ashamed of. He denied that either the American Government
or the American people were anxious for war with England; and he
maintained that the proper way to defend Canada was, not by
fortifications or gun-boats, but by persistence in a dignified policy
of neutrality.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardwell</hi> expressed the gratification
with which he was able to make the announcement that our relations
with the United States were perfectly friendly. With equal confidence
and pleasure he was enabled to state that there were no papers in the
possession of her Majesty's Government varying the principle upon
which the question of the Alabama stood between the two
Governments. With regard to the Convention limiting the naval force to
be kept on the lakes, Earl Russell had communicated with the United
States Minister his desire to substitute another agreement for the old
one; and, so soon as the notice to terminate the Reciprocity Treaty
had been given, no time would be lost by Government in endeavouring to
open negotiations on a subject of such vital importance. The right
hon. gentleman also explained in detail the steps which her Majesty's
Government, in conjunction with the colonial Government, intended to
take for the strategic defence of the provinces.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> did not wish to pass any
opinion on the probable termination of the civil war in America, but
he had no hesitation in saying that we were bound to put our Canadian
possessions in a state of proper defence. No one wanted the mother
country to defend an extended seaboard, but what the country expected
was that her Majesty's troops in Canada should not be placed in such a
position that their admitted bravery and skill would be of no
avail.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lowe</hi> asked the House to consider what
this country was bound to do for the defence of Canada. It was, he
thought, absurd to attempt to defend a seaboard of 1500 miles. In his
opinion, the better course would be to withdraw our troops from
Canada, and, in case of war with the United States, to concentrate our
force upon some vulnerable point of the Union.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">J. Fergusson</hi> complained that the
Government were not doing that which they themselves admitted to be
necessary for the defence of Canada. It was, he thought, a mere
mockery to speak of expending &#x00A3;50,000 a year for such a
purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi> underrated the value of the
North American provinces to the Crown, and asked whether the country
was prepared to pay an income tax of a shilling in the pound for the
purpose of defending Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Fortesque</hi> observed that the
Government considered it to be a matter of duty to defend our North
American provinces, provided they wished to remain dependent on the
British Crown and were prepared to play a manly part in their own
defence. He did not believe that the American people would be insane
and foolish enough to turn their arms against a friendly power by
attacking Canada.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> was of opinion that a
statement of the entire cost of the scheme of Canadian defence should
be laid before Parliament. He confessed he could not see any
reasonable prospect of supplying Canada with suitable ordnance for
many years to come.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Watkin</hi> contended that her Majesty's
Government should state distinctly to that of the United States that
they looked upon Canada as a part of the British empire, and that they
were prepared to defend it at all cost. In that case there would be no
war with America.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">M. Farquhar</hi> urged that, in
consideration of the loyal feeling of the Canadians towards the mother
country and the extent of our commercial interests in Canada, it was
the duty of this country to put forth all her power in the defence of
that colony.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Elcho</hi> concurred in the common-sense
view taken by Mr. Lowe, and said that it would be most impolitic to
attempt the defence of Canada by means of a British army. If war
should break out, he would recommend striking at some vital part of
the enemy. He regarded the proposals of the Government as powerless
for defence, though strong to invite aggression.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ayrton</hi> said the best way to defend
and preserve Canada would be to maintain amicable relations with the
United States. If, however, any dispute should arise between the two
countries the better course would be to submit the matter to
arbitration.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">R. Cecil</hi> deprecated discussions of
this irritating description, and maintained that for the honour of
England it was necessary that whatever was to be done for Canada
should be done quickly and completely.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright</hi> commented upon the
circumstance that a bitter feeling had grown up of late in reference
to the Federal States, and inquired how there was to be war if England
was not in favour of it and the United States were opposed to it. He
did not believe that any cause of hostility would arise out of the
recent affairs in Canada, but that, if the peace were broken, it would
be in consequence of some misunderstanding between the Government at
Washington and that at London. The hon. member proceeded to comment
upon the panic which now prevailed on the subject of America, and said
that, although "the City" appeared to be frightened, there was really
nothing to cause apprehension, and that "the City" was very seldom
right, because speculators were rarely able to form a cool and
dispassionate opinion upon any subject in which their financial
interests were concerned.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> denied that any feeling
of jealousy existed in this country against the United States; on the
contrary, he believed that there was no Englishman who did not survey
with pride the great Anglo-Saxon race which was rising on the other
side of the Atlantic. Feelings of irritation no doubt prevailed
against England in America--among the Northerners and the
Southerners--because we had refused to join the one or recognise the
other; but this feeling would wear away in time, and he was persuaded
that nothing would be done by England to provoke hostilities with
America. He did not agree with Mr. Lowe, that Canada could not be
defended. There was no intention to withdraw her Majesty's troops from
Canada, and he thought that, so long as the Canadians were prepared to
throw in their lot with us, we were bound in honour to do the utmost
we could for them. Her Majesty's Government had no cause of complaint
against America. There were, it was true, international claims arising
out of the war, but there was no reason to suppose that they could not
be adjusted without difficulty.</p>
<p>The subject then dropped.</p></div2>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Bombardment Of Fort
Fisher.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Engraving on page 249 is from a
sketch by our Special Artist, representing the scene within the
north-eastern salient of Fort Fisher, near Wilmington, during the
second great bombardment, which was commenced on the 18th of January,
and continued till the successful assault in the afternoon of the
15th. A part of the Federal fleet is seen lying at anchor towards the
right-hand side of this view; while the storming-party, which numbered
2500 men, is landing in the distance and preparing to extend itself
across the neck of land between the sea and the Cape Fear River. The
guns in battery, shown in the right-hand corner of the foreground, are
still being worked against that part of the Federal fleet which lies
farther to the right, and which cannot, therefore, be included in this
view. Most of the other guns in the fort have been disabled by the
heavy shot of the enemy; and the exposed position of the men, with
shells of the largest size falling and exploding in the midst of them,
is terribly apparent in our Illustration.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Camp Of Confederate
Prisoners At Elmira.</hi></p>
<p>The Federal Government has, since last July, confined a large
number of its prisoners of war in an encampment formed at Elmira, in
the State of New York, distant 277 miles from New York city, on the
Erie Railroad. We have been favoured by Mr. Horace Ruxton with a view
of this encampment, taken from the "Observatory" lately built upon the
public road outside the camp, which is daily visited by a multitude of
curious persons, who pay the proprietor of the Observatory at the rate
of ten cents a head for permission to have a peep at the formidable
captives. The inclosure within which these prisoners are confined is a
space of some twenty acres of ground, with a broad river running in
the rear, and high walls on every side. Here about 10,000 of the
Confederate soldiers who have been made prisoners of war are kept in
safe custody, lodging in the wooden huts or in the canvas tents shown
in our Engraving. Sentries are posted all round on the walls in such a
position that they can have a clear view of everything within the
camp, while the movements of the sentries themselves cannot be watched
by the prisoners. At night the whole place is lighted up with
kerosene-oil lamps. A number of spies are employed to mix with the
prisoners and inform the Commandant of any plots which they may form
to escape. Notwithstanding these precautions, an attempt was made, at
the end of November, by about 300 of them, to dig a trench
underground, from one of the hospitals to the wall, intending to pass
under the wall and get out beyond. This scheme was, however, detected,
and their escape prevented, on the night which they had
fixed. Mr. Ruxton assures us that the prisoners at Elmira are well fed
and clothed, and there is an excellent medical staff to attend to the
sick. They amuse themselves with reading and writing, or making toys
and other small articles for sale.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Federal Prison In Fort
Lafayette.</hi></p>
<p>An Englishman who has been connected with the Southern American
Confederacy, and is necessarily an active partisan, having lately
undergone a detention in one of the Federal prisons--Fort
Lafayette--sends us sketches of which we engrave two; and a letter,
from which we extract the following description:--"I send you three
sketches taken during a short imprisonment in Fort Lafayette--two
interior views of Casemate No. 2, and a view of the inside of the
fort. I may observe that, apart from their giving a true picture of
life in the Federal prison, seldom has artist or amateur put pencil to
paper with so little in his stomach as was contained in mine during
the few hours occupied upon these sketches; for during the brief
period of this self-allotted task I was invited to solve the
interesting problem of finding upon how very little 'bad bread,
salt-horse, and bean-soup' (all but the bean) a full-grown man can
continue the somewhat necessary operation of breathing. The rule as to
the issue of rations in this Northern prison, both in quality and
quantity, is unchangeable and really monotonous in its effect, A word
or two about this now celebrated prison may be interesting to your
readers. Like old Sumter, it is a sea-girt fortress, standing at the
entrance of New York Harbour, and, bristling with 100-pounders, is
ready, with its sister forts Hamilton and Richmond, on Long Island and
Staten Island respectively, to dispute the passage of the Narrows with
any Confederate or other gun-boats attempting to force a passage. As
soon as the war commenced, the Federal Government recognised the
adaptability of this fort as a military prison; and from that time to
the present its gun-rooms and casemates have been crowded with
Confederate prisoners of all ranks and grades. It was here that the
members of the Maryland Legislature were placed in durance vile, and
here it was that en-Governor Morehead of Kentucky, lingered till he
was brought to the verge of death. The Hon. Pierre Soul&#x00E9;, too,
and a host of other Confederate notables have been confined here; and
here, when I had the good fortune to obtain my order of release the
other day, I left many still in prison, amongst whom were Admiral
Buchanan, General Page and his Staff (captured in Mobile Bay and at
fort Morgan), Generals Pryor and Beal, Captain Thom and other
officers, besides a large number of privates and a few
blockade-runners. Among them was one Captain Beall, a Virginian, an
officer in the Confederate army and holding also a naval commission,
who was confined in the same casemate (No. 2) in which I was. He was
charged with piracy on Lake Erie, and was kept in irons and forbidden
to leave the casemate. With respect to the rules and regulations of
this fort, and the system of feeding the prisoners I have no words at
my disposal sufficient to express my indignation; but I must say, in
justice to the Yankee officers quartered there during my imprisonment,
that from one and all--including even 'Old Burke,' the Commandant,
himself--I received every courtesy; and this was not because I was a
Britisher, for the disease of Anglophobia had assumed an epidemic form
in the North. No discretion is allowed to these officers; they have
but to carry out the orders received from Washington, and it is in
their power to make themselves very obnoxious to those under their
charge. But the explanation of their good conduct in this case is, I
believe, that they were officers of the regular army of the United
States, and not of the volunteer service; their regiment was the 10th
Infantry. I conclude with my earnest prayer for a speedy exchange of
prisoners."</p>
<p>With respect to Captain Beall, who is mentioned by the writer of
the above letter as one of his fellow-prisoners, it appears from the
New York papers of the 25th that he was put to death on Governor's
Island the previous day. He behaved with much fortitude, and protested
against the execution of his sentence, declaring that what he had done
was in the service of his country.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">Artemus Ward His Book</hi>. (John Camden Hotten.)
The grimness of American humour is conspicuous in the remark
attributed to President Lincoln when, not long after his election, he
was afflicted with smallpox or some similar disease; "now," said he,
stretching out his huge hand, with a sardonic smile, "I shall be able
to give everybody something." American humour, moreover, is
remarkable for breadth, for exaggeration, for vulgarity, and for
profanity. The last characteristic is traced by Mr. Hotten, in the
preface to "Artemus Ward," to a very probable origin. He considers it
to have resulted from the practice in which the Puritans indulged of
mingling the sacred with the secular, the words of Scripture with the
customs of common life. This comic profanity has spread (not in
America only) from the pulpit to the exhibition-hall, the
lecture-room, and the "funny" periodical. American humour, in the
written or printed form, is further intensified (or not, as you
please) by misspelling and by the substitution of numerals for certain
words. This trick, whereby a quaint effect is gained, is not
unfamiliar to Englishmen, but with Americans it seems to be
indispensable. Fair samples of American humour of all kinds are to be
found in "Artemus Ward." "Artemus Ward" is, of course, a mere writing
name, but he who has adopted it is a type of a large class of
Americans, and his biography, sketched in Mr. Hotten's preface, gives
a graphic picture of the methods adopted by versatile Americans to
secure the "almighty dollar." "Artemus" writes his "book" in the
character of a wax-showman, and a few specimens of his style will
probably be found amusing. On a certain occasion, during his travels
with his show, he "got swampt in the exterior of New York State, one
dark and stormy night," when he observed in the distance "the gleams
of a taller candle." Thereupon he says, "tiein a hornet's nest to my
off hoss's tail, to kinder encourage him, I soon reached the place."
The place turns out to be a settlement of Shakers, "the strangest
religious sex," remarks Artemus, "I ever met." The Shakers appear to
dress oddly, if Artemus has any ground for saying "a solum female,
lookin somewhat like a last year's bean-pole stuck into a long
meal-bag, cum in and axed me was I athurst, and did I hunger," and for
addressing Elder Uriah in the words, "If I may be so bold, kind Sir,
what's the price of that pecooler kind of weskit you wear, incloodin
trimmins?" The "religious exercises" are thus spoken of:--"The
Shakers axed me to go to their meetin, as they was to have sarvices
that mornin; so I put on a clean biled rag and went. The meetin house
was as neat as a pin. The floor was white as chalk and smooth as
glass. The Shakers was all on hand, in clean weskits and meal-bags,
ranged on the floor like milingtery companies, the mails on one side
of the room and the females on tother. They commenst clappin their
hands and singin and dancin. They danced kinder slow at first; but as
they got warmed up they shaved it down very brisk, I tell you. Elder
Uriah, in partickler, exhiberted a right smart chance of spryness in
his legs, considerin his time of life, and as he cum a dubble shuffle
near where I sot I rewarded him with a approvin smile, and sed,
'Hunky, boy! Go it, my gay and festiv cuss!'" Artemus falls in with
the "noble savage" but he declares "Injins is pizin, whar ever found."
He continues:--"They sed I was their brother, &#x0026; wantid for to
smoke the Calomel of Peace with me. They then stole my jerkt beef
blankits, etsettery, skalpt my orgin grinder, and scooted with a Wild
Hoop. Durin the Cheaf's techin speech he said he shoold meet me in the
Happy Huntin Grounds. If he duz there will be a fite." He "pores 4th"
his "indignashun" against Salt Lake City, and describes his interview
with Mr. Brigham Young thus:--"My desire was to exhibit my grate show
in Salt Lake City, so I called on Brigham Yung, the grate mogull among
the mormins, and axed his permishun to pitch my tent and onfurl my
banner to the jintle breezis. He lookt at me in a austere manner for a
few minits, and sed, 'Do you bleeve in Solomon, Saint Paul, the
immaculateness of the Mormin Church, and the Latterday revelashuns?'
Sez I, 'I'm on it!' I make it a pint to git along plesunt, tho I
didn't know what under the Son the old feller was drivin at. He sed I
might show. 'You air a marrid man, Mister Yung, I bleeve?' sez I,
preparin to rite him sum free parsis. 'I hev eighty wives, Mister
Ward. I sertinly am marrid.' 'How do you like it as far as you hev
got?' sed I. He sed 'middlin.'...'Besides these wives you see here,
Mister Ward,' said Yung, 'I hev eighty more in varis parts of this
consecrated land which air Sealed to me.'...His wives fite amung
theirselves so much that he has bilt a fitin room for thare speshul
benefit....Sumtimes they abooz hisself individooally. They hev pulled
the most of his hair out by the roots....When he got eny waze cranky
thay'd shut him up in a dark closit, previsly whippin him arter the
stile of muthers when thare orfsprings git onruly." Mr. Ward is
himself married, and his nervous courtship of Betsy Jane was brought
to a close so delicately by the lady that her words deserve to be
recorded:--"I won't listen to your noncents no longer. Jes say rite
strate out what you're drivin at. If you mean gettin hitched, I'M IN!"
Hitched, of course, is the same as "spliced." And so adieu to
Mr. Artemus Ward and his American humour....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">DEFENCE OF CANADA.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Public</hi> questions involving a known
proportion of explosive elements turn up sometimes very
inopportunely. One such, and an exceedingly delicate one, has just
done so. The exposed, and, according to the opinion of some highly
respectable authorities, the indefensible, position of Canada, in the
event of war with the United States--which awful calamity may Heaven
avert!--asks consideration at a very unfortunate time. It is a subject
which the Government both in London and in Washington, and which the
people of the United Kingdom and the people of the States, would have
been glad to let remain on the shelf where it has been left unnoticed
for a long course of years. Many and good reasons for avoiding, if it
were possible, the discussion of it make themselves felt on both sides
of the Atlantic. A turn of affairs, however, has unexpectedly thrust
it upon public attention. Some practical decision in relation to it
must be come to; and hence it is desirable to look it manfully in the
face, to consider dispassionately its various bearings, and to do
whatever sound statesmanship shall deem right to be done, in a frank,
inoffensive, neighbourly spirit.</p>
<p>There are certain preliminaries which, we imagine, must be taken
for granted. The first is, that this country would offer no obstacle
to the assumption by Canada of formal, separate, nor, indeed, to the
annexation of herself to the American Republic, if, through her
legitimate constitutional organs, she should declare her preference
for a transference of her troth. The days are long gone by since
England would have thought it concerned either her interests or her
honour to retain an unwilling colony. The second is, that so long as
Canada wishes to preserve unbroken the tie which connects her with the
British empire, England will not permit that tie to be severed by
force from without. The leaders of political opinion of all parties
have pronounced the opposite course incompatible with the maintenance
of our national honour. The third is, that the mutual position of
Canada and the United States is far different from what it was before
the outbreak of the civil war. The Republic has become a formidable
military Power, and, as such, inspires apprehensions which would have
been groundless four years ago. In her present condition, Canada,
apart from our protection, could offer no effectual resistance to an
armed aggression by her neighbour; and therefore the tenour of her
relations with the States would be mainly determined by the policy
which the States' Government might think fit to adopt. With all the
aid which England might afford her in case of a contest, her
disadvantages would be many and serious. The question whether she can
be rendered more secure, especially against the first brunt of a
hostile invasion, seems an inevitable one. As against the military
power developed by the neighbouring Republic, Canada is at present
defenceless. If assailed, Canada is to be defended. How best may
Canada be defended, on the understanding that England is to stand by
her whenever need requires? This is the problem which is just now
seeking solution.</p>
<p>Two plans are before the public. We shall not affect to strike a
balance between their respective merits and demerits; this we prefer
to leave to the judgment of our readers. All that we propose doing is
to submit a general outline of each and to state, as clearly as we are
able the arguments by which each is supported.</p>
<p>Her Majesty's Government propose, on the basis of Colonel Jervois's
report, to put Quebec into a defensible condition by the erection of
suitable fortifications, on the consent of the Canadians to do the
same for Montreal and Toronto. Any attempt to hold the entire line of
frontier would, it is assumed owing to its great extent, overtask the
strength of the colony and of the kingdom combined. It will not,
therefore, be made. The strategical arrangement which Ministers
recommend, as at once feasible and likely to prove effective, is the
choice of these more vulnerable points for the purpose of making them
impregnable, at least for a time.  It is taken for granted that any
<pb n="270"/> invading force hurled against Canada by the United
States would, in point of numbers, greatly overmatch such military
force as we might permanently station in the colony, as well as any
militia which the colonists could themselves raise and maintain. All
that can be done at present is to secure against fearful odds the
smaller army until the whole military strength of the United Kingdom
could be rendered available against the aggressor. These proposed
strongholds would, it is said, answer the purpose. On the approach of
a hostile army too formidable to be grappled with in the open country,
every soldier in Canada would be placed behind stone walls, which
would counterbalance the disparity of numbers. It would be hazardous
for the assailants to overrun the province, leaving these garrisons
unreduced in their rear. They would be compelled, therefore, to sit
down before them, and formally besiege them--an operation which would
probably consume some months. Meantime this country would pour into
the colony whatever amount of men it could command, and all the evil
consequences of a surprise would thus be obviated.</p>
<p>The other plan of defence, originally sketched by Mr. Lowe in the
recent debate in the Commons and since supported by the <hi
rend="italic">Times</hi>, is as nearly as possible the opposite of
that proposed by her Majesty's Ministers. It starts from the
assumption that, should war unhappily break out between this kingdom
and the Western Republic, Canada would be for the former the worst
possible battle-field within the whole range of her choice. As a base
of operations, it would lie at a most inconvenient distance from the
source of her supplies, with which, moreover, direct communication
would be open only six months in the year; whereas, to the enemy it
would be always accessible, being close at hand for any amount of men,
commissariat, and ammunition which his exigencies might demand. While
it would drain our strength to the utmost, it would give opportunity
to the United States to effect the greatest possible injury at the
least possible cost. It offers, for these reasons alone, precisely the
ground upon which the Republic would wish the conflict to be waged,
and it would be a grave strategical error for us to accept it. Our
policy should rather consist in forcing the foe to employ all his
available forces in distant quarters, in fastening upon his most vital
points, in putting him upon the defensive, and making him feel the
largest share of the sacrifices and miseries inflicted by the scourge
of war.</p>
<p>The arguments by which this proposal is sustained, besides those
which are obvious on the face of it, may be thus cursorily stated. It
would enable us to withdraw at once the military force which we now
maintain in the colony, which, it is alleged, is sufficiently large to
engender ill-will, but not powerful enough to ensure safety. Modern
artillery can speedily reduce the most solid fortifications,
especially if isolated for several months together, as they would be
in Canada, and the proposed fortresses, instead of proving a temporary
shelter for an inferior force, would serve rather as traps in which
the pick of our troops would be shut up and taken. Besides, if we once
fairly commit ourselves to the scheme of defending Canada by
fortifying her frontier, and involve her in a share of the
undertaking, we become pledged to go through with it at any cost, and
however impolitic. The works which we erect will be useless until they
are armed, and, when armed, will be worse than useless without
adequate garrisons. The expenditure required for them will not only be
immediate, but must continue, even though peace should remain
unbroken, through many years, and always on an increasing scale. We
shall be sure to sink an enormous amount of treasure, which, in the
event of peace, will be sheer waste, and, in the event of war, will
compel us to adopt a line of defence which, above all others, we
should strive to avoid.</p>
<p>Such are the two strategical plans now before the country, The
first is in accordance with traditional ideas; the last is in bold
defiance of them, The soundness of either of them will be judged of
according to the habits and standards of thought most in favour with
those to whose choice they are submitted. Both of them have been
framed with a view to the most effectual defence of Canada, should
Canada be assailed. But Canada is exposed to aggression by the
American Republic alone, and the only conceivable motive for that
aggression is a desire, through our province, to inflict a wound upon
us. The pith of the alternative is, whether we shall cover our most
vulnerable part with defensive armour, to be worn at all times, or
whether we shall trust to our own weapon of offence, and to our skill
in wielding it, whenever driven to do so, just how and where it will
be most dreaded. Some would feel more safe under the first system,
some under the last. Neither plan would afford a fair pretext for
quarrel, nor, perhaps, would either present temptation. But it is
urged on behalf of Mr. Lowe's suggestion that, while it would remove
every possible excuse for attack, it would also convince America that,
in case of the attack being made by her, she must look for the return
blow where it will most painfully tell home upon her.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the Moravian we have intelligence from New York to the morning
of the 12th inst. The war news, which consists mostly of rumours, is
confused, and in many cases contradictory. Sherman's movements are
surrounded with mystery, all the reports respecting his movements
having proceeded from refugees, prisoners, or scouts. Sherman is
reported to have occupied Choran, and is also said to have defeated
Cheatham's corps, which was moving to the assistance of
Hardee. General Johnston is supposed to have attacked General Sherman
in front, and is said to have been defeated. The locality of the
battle is, however, not given.</p>
<p>Nothing was certainly known of any Federal advance from Wilmington;
but it was rumoured in Washington that General Schofield had had an
engagement in North Carolina. A body of Federals, advancing from
Newbern, was said to have arrived near Kingston, in North
Carolina.</p>
<p>Admiral Dalhgren has captured Fort White, George Town, South
Carolina, with fifteen guns. In making the attack, the Admiral's
flagship was sunk by a torpedo.</p>
<p>Sheridan, after a long period of inaction, appears to have given a
good account of himself. He met Early between Stanton and
Charlottesville, and routed the Confederates. In the engagement the
Federals, who are said to have lost only ten men, took General Early's
Staff, eighty-seven officers, 1100 soldiers, seven guns, and a large
number of waggons.</p>
<p>Of the doings of General Grant and of General Lee there are
nothing but rumours of the vaguest kind. Governor Vance had appealed
to the people of North Carolina for provisions for General Lee's army,
and was said to have declared that for some months General Lee's
troops must depend on North Carolina and Virginia for support.</p>
<p>The Confederate Senate has passed, by a majority of one vote, a
bill for arming negroes. It was said that some negro soldiers had been
seen confronting the Federal pickets.</p>
<p>The inauguration of President Lincoln and Vice-President Andrew
Johnson passed off with the usual ceremonies. The President never
appeared to so much advantage as on the solemn occasion of his
resuming power, with general approval, for a new term; but it is not
difficult to gather, from the descriptions given in the New York
papers and by the correspondents of English journals, that the
Vice-President was drunk--he stammered out a few broken sentences in
tipsy glorification of himself as a "plebeian," to the disgust and
shame of all who assisted at the ceremony. The New York journals
stigmatise Mr. Johnson's conduct, and some recommend him to
resign.</p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln has been officially informed of England's approval of
the recent Canadian legislation regarding Southern refugees. The
Canadian passport order has been rescinded, and it has also been
agreed not to increase the naval force on the lakes.</p>
<p>The Federal Senate has confirmed President Lincoln's appointment of
Mr. M'Culloch to the secretaryship of the Treasury. The new Secretary
has expressed his disapproval of issues of paper money, and his
resolve to promote a return to specie payments.</p>
<p>Seventeen States have ratified the Constitutional amendment to
abolish and prohibit slavery in the United States.</p>
<p>The celebration for the Union victories by land and sea, which was
to have taken place in New York on the 4th of March, but was postponed
on account of the inclemency of the weather, took place on the 6th
inst., under circumstances of more than usual brilliancy and
success. The display had rarely been equalled in New York. The people
of the States of California, Nevada, and Oregon also observed the day
in an enthusiastic manner.</p>
<p>The United States Consul at Matamoras had left, and arrived at New
Orleans, the reason of his expulsion being the non-recognition of the
French and Mexican authorities in Mexico by the United States.</p>
<p>On the 7th inst. an express-train from Washington for New York and
a passenger-train from Philadelphia for New York came into
collision. Nine persons were killed, and forty others received
injuries. Nearly all the sufferers were soldiers, several of them
being returned prisoners.</p></div2>

<p>....Chang, otherwise Sing-woo-bah, the great Chinese giant, is
coming. it is time. We have had rather a surfeit of dwarfs lately;
and, by way of a change, it might be as well to try a course of
monstrosities running large. When Captain Lemuel Gulliver was tired of
Liliput he went to Brobdignag. Sing-woo-bah, is said to have been last
seen abroad at Shanghai, on the night of the last full moon, looking
over a wall seven feet six inches high. He is to be accompanied by a
pianist, and a suite of Chinese servants, from the comprador to the
shoe-sole chalker. Chang, alias Sing-woo-bah, will, doubtless, draw. A
giant, however, labours under this disadvantage, that, beyond wearing
a field marshal's uniform, selling photographs of himself and grinning
in an idiotic manner, he is seldom able to do anything. Now a dwarf,
as a rule, can be taught to sing, dance, recite, and attitudinise, and
is often, as the Yankee showman called his kangaroo, "an amoozin'
little cuss," and as full of tricks as a waggonload of monkeys with
their tails burnt off. I remember once, in New York, trying very hard
to persuade P. T. Barnum to get up an ethnological tea-party and
invite to meet the subscriber, the Irish and French giants, the Nova
Scotian giantess, the Albino Family, Commodore Nutt, Minnie Warren,
and the Wild Man of Tehuantepec, all of whom were at that moment among
the attractions of his marvellous museum on Broadway. The great
showman did not disapprove of the idea, but he pointed out to me its
impracticability. The dwarfs, he explained, were so very irritable,
and the giants were such fools.</p>
<p>The which reminds me of a little anecdote of P. T. B., who is one
of the dryest humourists I ever met with, and "not half a bad fellow,"
as fellows go. On board the river-steamers in the States they feed you
for a moderate outlay (seventy-five cents a meal) very sumptuously,
but the portions supplied are usually of microscopic
dimensions. Barnum had taken passage by one of these stately Noah's
arks, say, from Albany to New York. He called, at tea-time, for a
beefsteak. The negro brought him the usual little, shrivelled mite of
broiled flesh, certainly not sufficient for more than two
mouthfuls. Barnum poised the morsel on his fork, scanned it
critically, as though it were a sample of steak submitted to his
inspection, and then returned it to the waiter, saying, "Yes; that's
what I mean. Bring me some of it...."</p></div2>

<p>....Some member should move for a return of the number of times the
"battle of the guns" has been fought in the house this Session. Again
this question has been raised with a kind of dismal humour faintly
reminding one of the organised witticisms of his ballot-speeches by
Mr. Berkeley, and this as a sequitur to a severely accentuated palaver
on English policy in the United States affairs, which Mr. Berkeley as
a member of Parliament, independent in every possible sense of the
term, whether applied to politics or to language, had a safe and
harmless right to deliver. Probably the name of Peacocke will not
convey any extraordinary notions of eminence in politics and influence
in Parliament to the world in America, or the swelling talk and fussy
bombast of the member for Maldon might have deserved and invoked a
more pointed rebuke than was conveyed in the grim irony of Sir Henry
Willoughby, when, with a sarcastic smile on his lips, he conjured
Mr. Peacocke not to involve his country in a war with America. The
Americans are so sensitive in their feelings towards England that they
may even be roused by a voice from Little Pedlington; and therefore it
behoves Mr. Peacocke to be cautious and moderate, conscious as he must
be of the responsibility which lies upon him....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our Coast Defences.</hi>--Mr. <hi

of a war with America, and urged that our harbours and dockyards were
in an almost defenceless condition.--Mr. Peacocke and Mr. Baillie
followed in a similar strain, while Sir H. Willoughby and Mr. Forster
condemned the use of irritating language towards the United
States.--Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Hartington</hi> said our forts were
armed with 110-pounder Armstrong and the old 68-pounder guns, which
could resist the attack of a wooden fleet. As regarded iron-plated
ships, our own ironclads could look after them, if it became necessary
to do so, and next year the Government hoped to be in a better
position for deciding upon the gun to be adopted for general use.--Sir
<hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> said the plans for the
fortification of Quebec and Montreal were very simple and very
complete, but he must urge the Admiralty to place a flotilla of
gun-boats on the Canadian lakes.--After some further conversation the
subject dropped.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">America.</hi>--Earl <hi
rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> laid upon the table of the House a
letter, with an inclosure from Mr. Adams, the representative of the
United States, declaring that he was commanded by the President to
deliver a notice in the month of March of the desire of the Government
of the United States that the reciprocity treaty between this country
and the United States should terminate, and that accordingly the
treaty would terminate in twelve months from the date of the delivery
of the notice. The inclosure was merely a vote of the Congress, and
consented to by the president, declaring that it was no longer to the
interest of the United States that the treaty should be continued. The
noble Earl said that the act of violence perpetrated by the so-called
Confederate States on the lakes completely justified the United States
in giving notice of the termination of the convention, for it was not
to be expected that the United States would permit such acts of
violence to be repeated, nor was it to be expected that the United
States should submit passively to such acts of violence without means
of retaliation. He entertained hopes, with regard to the reciprocity
treaty, that a renewal of it could be arranged with modifications,
which would be more advantageous to the United States, and which they
might consider more just to themselves. Mr. Adams had informed him of
the result of the negotiations which had taken place between the
President and the so-called Confederates. The noble Earl then
expressed a hope that when he should present to him a notice of the
termination of the reciprocity treaty he should find that the
President and the Government of the United States were ready to
consider a proposition by which a small and limited armament might be
kept upon the lakes for the purpose of the police on both sides, and
also of a renewal of this reciprocity treaty on terms which should be
agreed to by both parties, and which might be negotiated during the
twelve months which would elapse before the treaty would cease to be
in operation. Of course, Mr. Adams did not offer to give any assurance
upon the subject, but the words which he used induced the noble Earl
to trust that such would be the case. He should be extremely sorry if
anything should occur in this country to bring about an opposite
result. He therefore much regretted some expressions that had been
used and some speeches that had been made tending to excite in the
United States a disposition unfavourable to this country. He believed
that in this respect this country had behaved wrongfully to the United
States, and had given them just cause to complain of the unfriendly
spirit shown in this country towards them, Her Majesty's Government
intended to pursue the same course with regard to the United States as
heretofore. A new Minister would leave London to-morrow to represent
her Majesty at Washington. The noble Earl concluded by passing an
encomium upon Lord Lyons, the Minister of the past, and Sir Frederick
Bruce, the Minister of the future. The noble Earl then took a review
of the policy pursued by her Majesty's Government, towards America,
and maintained that the course they had adopted was the wise and
prudent one. They had appointed a new Minister from England to
Washington, and had instructed him to carry out the same policy which
Lord Lyons had followed with such satisfaction to both countries.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi

The Defences Of Canada.</hi></p>
<p>The House went into Committee of Supply, when</p>
<p>The Marquis of <hi rend="smallcaps">Hartington</hi> moved the vote
of &#x00A3;50,000 for the Canadian defences, and entered into a most
elaborate statement of our relations with Canada and the defenceless
state of the colony. He stated that the Canadians were quite prepared
to bear their share of the expense of keeping those fortifications in
an efficient condition.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bentinck</hi> thought it was a useless
expenditure, and capable of doing more harm than good; and he
therefore moved that the sum of &#x00A3;50,000 be omitted from the
votes. If we should have a war with the United States that sum would
be totally inefficient for the defence of the Canadian provinces. He
objected to the vote in <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi>, because it
would be likely to draw on the evil which we were anxious to avoid;
and to erect forts would be holding out a challenge to the United
States which they might be induced to accept.</p>
<p>General <hi rend="smallcaps">Peel</hi> considered that England was
bound to protect her colonies, and, with regard to Canada, we must
defend it with the whole strength of the country. He would not go into
the question of whether the grant was enough or not, but the value he
attached to it was, that it would convince the colony and America that
we would protect Canada to the last.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Butler-Johnstone</hi> objected to the
smallness of the vote.</p>
<p>Major <hi rend="smallcaps">Anson</hi> thought it would be
impossible for us to hold Canada if the Americans thought proper to
seize it; but there was no reason to suppose that any such attempt
would ever be made by the Americans.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Adderley</hi> gave his assent to the
vote.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Bury</hi> thought it would be necessary
to form earthworks at certain points in Canada, by which an invading
army must come, and by that means a comparatively small force would be
able to hold at bay a numerically much stronger force.</p>
<p>After a discussion, in which Mr. Watkin, Mr. Haliburton,
Mr. S. Lefevre, and Lord r. Montagu took part,</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">C. Fortescue</hi>, on the part of the
Government, admitted that they were bound to support the independence
of the Canadians; but at the same time the Government felt that the
colony ought to make some effort to defend itself.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">F. Smith</hi> expressed his opinion that
Canada could be defended.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lowe</hi> replied to the arguments that
had been used in favour of defending Canada. He denied that the
Americans would be compelled to go by any particular route to invade
Canada, because they could enter it by at least four or five different
points. The Americans had now the largest army and the most
experienced one in the world, and one that we could not oppose with
any chance of success. We ought therefore to deal candidly with
Canada, and let her know that, although she would find England a warm
friend and ally, who would defend her to the utmost of her power, yet
that she must be prepared to defend herself, for that we could not be
supposed to undertake a defence that would be perfectly hopeless. He
deprecated the Government of this country stirring up the Canadians to
a defence that would be entirely hopeless. Nevertheless, he was not
prepared to take upon himself the responsibility of refusing the
vote. It was only a trifle, and the Government asked for it on its own
responsibility, and he was willing to support the vote, although he
still entertained the same opinion that he had previously
expressed.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi> supported the vote, because
to refuse it would discourage the Canadians at a most critical
moment. He scouted the idea of Mr. Lowe that England should allow
America quietly to take possession of Canada without a struggle
because it was possible that the defence might not be successful. If
it should happen that America should go to war with England, that war
would be carried on in every part of the world, so as to make their
victory as expensive and as difficult as possible. It was preposterous
to lay down a principle that an extensive line of frontier in our own
colonies should not be defended, for it was our duty to defend them to
the last.</p>
<p> Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cardwell</hi> said that he had been
informed by the American Government that the notice for the
termination of the Reciprocity Treaty would be withdrawn, and that the
passport system would be abolished. He defended the policy of the
Government, and contended that, if necessary, we could defend
Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bright</hi> said there was no one in the
country who would attempt effectually to defend Canada against the
whole power of the United States. There was no safety for Canada in
the event of a war between England and America but in the neutrality
of that colony. The sum to be voted was not much for this country, but
he objected to the vote on principle. It had been said that Canada was
to bear the greatest portion of the expenditure, but on what ground
could she be asked to do it? There was no chance of a war between
Canada and America, and if we were to go to war with America the
battle-field would be Canada. On what ground, then, could we ask her
to bear any portion of the expenses? He objected to the vote, not
because it was throwing so much money away, but because it was
inaugurating a policy which we should be compelled to abandon or else
that would lead to the separation of Canada from this country. He did
not object to that colony separating itself from this country, but he
did object to the severance taking place after a feeling of
irritation. He charged the Opposition with being in collusion with the
Government, and called upon the House to take the matter out of the
hands of the Executive Government and not force upon Canada a burden
it could not long bear.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi> regretted he could not
have the vote of the hon. gentleman, but it was clear that the vote
met with the approval of the large majority of the members of the
House. This was not a Canadian but an Imperial question, and he
regretted that it should go forth to the world that there was a
difference of opinion upon it. He denied that this defence was
proposed from an anticipation of war, it was simply a matter of
precaution, which every country with a large frontier adopted. He
appealed to the hon. member (Mr. Bentinck) not to divide the
Committee, as it would weaken the effect of the vote.</p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bentinck</hi> expressed his willingness to
withdraw his amendment, but the Committee would not allow him.</p>
<p>The Committee then divided, when the amendment was negatived by a
majority of 275 to 40.</p>
<p>The veto was therefore agreed to.</p></div2>

<p>We have intelligence from New York to the 19th ult.</p>
<p>President Davis had sent to the Confederate Congress a message in
which he stated that further and more energetic legislation was
required, as the country was environed with perils, and Richmond in
greater danger than heretofore during the war. The militia laws needed
modification, and a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was almost
indispensable. If the measures recommended by him were adopted, and if
the Congress and people co-operated, the South might enter upon the
coming campaign with cheerful confidence in the result. General Grant,
the message said, had refused to meet General Lee in a conference for
the purpose of negotiations for peace. The North would accept only
abject and unconditional submission, and the South had no choice but
to continue the contest to its final issue. With 2,000,000 dols. in
coin the armies of Virginia and North Carolina could be supplied for
the remainder of the year; and President Davis recommended measures
for making all coin within the Confederacy available for the uses of
the troops. He also recommended other measures for the replenishment
of the Confederate Treasury, and for the impressment of provisions and
stores. The Confederate Congress had subsequently adjourned; and it
may be presumed that the bills required by President Davis had been
passed.</p>
<p>General Lee, in an order to the army commanding an observance of
the 10th of March (the day appointed by President Davis for a general
fast) as a day of fasting and prayer, tells his soldiers that God had
sorely chastened them; and speaks of the present time as one of
trouble, contrasting it with the days when God delivered them from
their enemies.</p>
<p>The James River canal is being repaired, and President Davis has
called upon the farmers to aid in the work. Vigorous efforts are being
made at Richmond to organise coloured troops, and all whites able to
bear arms have been draughted into the service. President Lincoln has
made a speech in which he declared that the Confederates would stand
out as long as they could draw upon the last branch of their
resources, and that he rejoiced to see the end so near.</p>
<p>General Sherman was gradually continuing his forward
movement. After occupying Cheraw he marched on Fayetteville, which he
reached and took possession of on the 12th ult. General Hardee
retreated before Sherman, keeping in his front at a moderate
distance. General Sherman's advance was not altogether unopposed, for
the Confederate cavalry under Hampton attacked Kilpatrick inflicting
on him great loss and taking several hundred prisoners. According to
the Federal account, Kilpatrick in his turn attacked Hampton, and
recovered all he had lost. The river communication between
Fayetteville and Wilmington had been opened, so that Sherman at the
former place had a secure base.</p>
<p>While Sherman was thus marching through the centre of the
Carolinas, General Schofield had made his way from Wilmington to
Kinston. In front of the latter place his advance seems to have been
attacked by Bragg, and to have suffered some loss in prisoners. Next
day, however, Schofield's main body came up, and Bragg's further
assaults were repulsed with great loss to him. He retreated on Kinston
and afterwards to Goldsborough. At Kinston he destroyed a ram and a
large quantity of stores. The place was occupied by the Federals.</p>
<p>General Sheridan reports his arrival at Fredericksburg Railway,
crossing the South Anna River on the 15th ult. He continued to damage
the James River Canal to Goochland, whence he turned northward and
destroyed the bridges on both Annas. At Virginia Central Railway
Bridge the Confederates attempted resistance, but were driven off,
losing three cannon.</p>
<p>Mobile despatches of the 14th ult. state that the city was strongly
menaced; twenty-one of the enemy's vessels were in sight. Great
activity prevailed among the enemy in the Lower Bay. Maury recommends
the inhabitants to prepare for an attack, and has ordered
non-combatants to leave.</p>
<p>Baton Rouge despatches of the 9th report the Confederate General
Forrest at Macon, Georgia, with 15,000 cavalry, to which he was daily
receiving additions.</p>
<p>The Jersey Senate has rejected the constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>Gold, on the 18th ult., was quoted at New York at 165&#x00B7;.</p>
<p>The breaking-up of the ice on the Susquehanna and other rivers by
sudden thaw has caused the inundation of the districts along their
courses, and millions of dollars' worth of property is estimated to
have been destroyed. The petroleum districts in Pennsylvania have been
the greatest sufferers, and Oil City has been wholly submerged.</p>
<p>Mr. James Gordon Bennett, of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Herald</hi>, has been offered, and has declined, the French
mission. Mr. John Bigelow, Acting Charg&#x00E9; d'Affaires, has been
appointed.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Lower House of the Canadian Parliament has adopted, by a
majority of 99 to 33 votes, the address to the Queen praying for a
confederation of the British North American Provinces.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government has proposed a vote of 1,000,000 dols. for
the permanent defence of the country and 350,000 dols. for the
expenses of the volunteers on the frontier.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister announces that the Government must maintain
the police and militia on the frontier so long as the war lasts, and
fulfil their obligations as good neighbours to the United
States.</p></div2>

<p>A Confederate ram, the Stonewall (late Olinda) is in great straits
cruising about the Spanish and Portuguese coast. The first we heard of
her was that she had put into Corunna for repairs, and that the
Federal ships Niagara (frigate) and Sacramento (frigate) had taken up
their stations outside the port. The Stonewall left last week; but,
instead of a fight coming off, we have the following telegram from
Lisbon, dated Monday:--"The Confederate ram Stonewall has arrived here
from Ferrol, where she left the Federal war-steamers Niagara and
Sacramento. The Portuguese authorities have ordered the Stonewall to
leave the harbour, and have manned the forts." By a later telegram
from Lisbon we learn that the Stonewall quitted the Tagus on Tuesday;
and that the Federal cruisers, which had arrived that morning,
attempted also to leave the Tagus before the expiration of the term of
twenty-four hours required to elapse between the sailing of a vessel
of one belligerent and the subsequent departure of an armed ship
belonging to the other belligerent. The forts at Belem consequently
opened fire on the Federal steamers, and a shot struck the Niagara on
the poop and killed a seaman. Both the Niagara and the Sacramento, it
is added, then anchored. The Confederate ram Stonewall was built at
Bordeaux ostensibly for the Danish Government. She is about 1600 tons
burden, has a 12-foot prow, is iron-clad, and is armed with three
guns--viz., a 300-pounder forward, and two 200-pounders aft. Her speed
is about ten knots, and she has a crew of about eighty hands. The
Niagara is of 4582 tons. She has a crew of 450 hands. Her armament
consists of fifteen 200-pounders. The Sacramento's tonnage is
1367. She has a crew of about 180 hands. Her armament consists of two
120-pounders and eight 68-pounders. The speed of the Niagara and
Sacramento is about twelve knots.</p></div2>

sketch of a couple of the old soldiers of the war of 1812, who may
still be met with, occasionally, in the streets and at the
public-houses of New York, Boston, and other American cities. These
worthy veterans are fond of wearing a cocked hat, with tricolor plume,
and a sword, with a white scarf about the breast, upon such occasions
as the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, the appointed
day of thanksgiving for national victories, or that of the
inauguration of a President of the Federal Union. They are, however,
now becoming rare, since forty years and more have elapsed from the
date of their military achievements, and the conflict in which they
were engaged, though its recollection may be flattering to American
patriotism, has been quite thrown into the shade by the enormous
battles of the present civil war.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="italic">A New Atmosphere</hi>. By Gail Hamilton. (Sampson
Low, Son, and Marston.). An importation from the other side of the
Atlantic, where she-doctors, and she-lecturers, and she-clerks, and
she-nondescripts receive more encouragement than they have yet met
with amongst us, and where the independence of women has broken out in
the form of Bloomerism and other extravagances. Our author deals with
the "woman question." It appears that the moral and social atmosphere
of our age is extremely corrupt, and that we want a new one. Upon that
point there will probably be little difference of opinion, but upon
the means whereby the required purification is to be effected there
will be great diversity of sentiment. Whether the "oak-and-vine"
relationship between men and women should be confined simply to
poetry, and women from girlhood upward should be instructed in such
trades, callings, arts, and sciences as will enable them to gain a
livelihood in competition with and independently of men, is a serious
question; but our author seems to think it ought to be unhesitatingly
answered in the affirmative. Man, if we read our author correctly, is
a selfish, grasping, cowardly, double-faced oppressor; woman is, by
force of circumstances, a sly, designing, over-worked, suffering
slave. And this is the result of existing laws and customs--especially
so far as marriage is concerned. Our author by no means blasphemes
marriage in the abstract, but scoffs at the preliminaries which
precede and the conditions which follow the actual practice. Husbands
have all the sweets, wives have all the bitters, of connubial life. If
husbands would suckle the baby, and take their turn at the
perambulator, and put the children to bed, and wash the linen, and
make the caps, there would be some chance of a fair adjustment of
domestic duties; but, as things are, selfish man "goeth forth to his
work and to his labour until the evening," and expects his harassed
wife to perform the household drudgery, have his lordship's refection
prepared, and bring his offspring in apple-pie order to receive the
rare paternal caress. No doubt there is more of the spirit of traffic
than there should be in many a marriage; no doubt there is too much
selfishness in many husbands; no doubt there is too much labour
imposed on many wives; no doubt there is too little chance of
profitable employment for many unmarried women; but whether a general
withdrawal of the "restrictions of existing customs" would be the best
cure for the evils we beg leave to doubt. Readers of Aristophanes do
not need to be told that "woman's rights" have been advocated before
our day, and that the consequence of woman's complete independence
have been described by a master-hand. Gail Hamilton's views are put
forward in a very earnest, very dogmatical, sometimes sensible, and
occasionally rhapsodical, style; but we do not think they will be
generally adopted on this side of the Atlantic. It will be long before
we cease to associate the idea of independence with inexpressibles,
and of protection with petticoats; nor is it by any means certain
that, because a great difficulty is co-existent with certain
restrictions, the difficulty is traceable merely to the restrictions;
there may be collateral causes which might be found, if sought for,
and which might be more safely removed than the
restrictions....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....Private letters from New York bring me two or three
echoes. First, the great sensation in the Empire City at present is
the Rev. Dr. Bellows, who, Sunday after Sunday, is uttering thundering
philippics against the reigning luxury and extravagance in ladies'
dress. An old, old text. Did not the Hebrew prophet of old inveigh
against the sumptuary follies of his countrywomen--their bracelets and
their bangles, and their "round tires like the moon?" Dr. Bellows is a
Unitarian clergyman, a most learned, pious, and eloquent divine, who
first attracted public notice by standing up boldly in defence of
Shakspeare and the drama, and has recently been doing the good work of
the American Sanitary Commission at San Francisco. As a preacher, he
is worth a hundred Beechers and Cheevers, for it is a peculiarity with
Dr. Bellows that he always preaches charity, and peace, and
brotherhood among all men. I fear, however, that the Doctor will take
but little by his motion <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> ladies'
dresses. The fair ones of Gotham flock to him by hundreds and listen
complacently while he denounces "cataract" curls, small bonnets, hoop
skirts, and draggling trains; but they have not the slightest
intention of abating the excess in their apparel. Withal, let me
hasten to remark that the American ladies, in their wildest
exuberances of dress, have always been moderate in their patronage of
crinoline. An American hoop, in comparison with the shocking hen-coop
worn here, is as a wineglass to a diving-bell.</p>
<p>Another New York echo tells me of a curious reform meditated by
Mr. Hiram Cranston, the proprietor of the New York Hotel, and which,
if properly carried out, will effect a thorough revolution in the
eating and drinking customs of our cousins. Mr. Cranston is about to
abolish the monster table-d'h&#x00F4;te, formerly held in his hotel,
and where from five to six hundred guests could be fed at one time,
very much after the fashion of wild animals, at scrambling,
uncomfortable meals, delusively termed breakfast, dinner, and
supper. For this wolfish system of arrangement is about to be
substituted a coffee-room, arranged on the European principle--that is
to say, a quiet and well ordered salle &#x00E0; manger, where, at your
own table, you may order your own meal, and breakfast, dine, or sup
&#x00E0; la carte, in peace and tranquillity. The New York Hotel is
mainly frequented by ladies and gentlemen who have lived in Europe,
and who have enjoyed comfort and luxury enough there to be disgusted
with the roaring, jostling "feeds" at the St. Nicholas and the Fifth
Avenue....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CONSCRIPTION IN NEW YORK.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> New York correspondent, by whom we
are supplied with the Illustration on our front page, writes as
follows:--"On Wednesday, the 15th of March, the long-expected draught
was put into operation in this city. For a day or two previously it
had been very generally stated in the newspapers that this most
disagreeable 'military necessity' had been indefinitely postponed; but
volunteering has been far too slack of late to give the slightest hope
that, without conscription, New York could furnish the twenty-six
thousand men due from her to the Federal armies. Coming thus
unexpectedly, the announcement that the draught was actually going on
caused a good deal of consternation in the city. While I write, the
fatal 'wheel' is turning, and the names are being drawn at the offices
of the several provost marshals. These places are thronged all day
long with anxious crowds. Irish faces are very prevalent in the
crowd. There is no disturbance; but, as a precautionary measure, the
draughting-stations are everywhere guarded by a strong force of
police. I send a sketch of the interior of one of these places, with
the wheel at work. The blindfolded man draws a slip of paper from the
wheel and hands it to an official on the platform below him, who reads
aloud the name and address written upon it, and then passes it to
another person, who transfers it to the table where the registering
clerks are at work. Jokes are very freely circulated in the crowd at
the expense of the luckless individuals whose names are read from the
slips, and it sometimes happens that the most reckless of the jokers
finds himself next on the list of the conscripts. Lists of the names
drawn are published in all the morning papers, which are eagerly
scanned by anxious-looking people of all classes and callings in
life. Several prominent citizens already figure in the lists--among
others, Mr. H. J. Raymond, editor of the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi>."</p></div2>

<p>The Peruvian has brought news from New York to the 25th ult.</p>
<p>The advance of General Sherman had been checked by the Confederates
under Generals Johnston and Hardee. The former Confederate General
reports that he engaged and defeated one of Sherman's columns on the
19th ult., near Bentonville, and that Sherman only saved himself by
intrenching. Hardee defeated the other column, which attacked his
position near the junction of the Black and South Rivers. The Raleigh
papers state that Sherman attacked Hardee in his intrenched position
and made three desperate charges, and was each time repulsed with
great slaughter. Some accounts state that in this engagement Bragg's
troops were driven back, compelling Hardee likewise to retire to
prevent his being flanked, and that Hardee, in withdrawing, abandoned
two guns for want of transportation. Other papers say that Hardee
abandoned nothing, and that the Federals were fairly and completely
beaten. Northern papers report that Sherman occupied Goldsborough on
the 19th, and regard the successes claimed by Johnston and Hardee as
unimportant. They think the result will prove favourable to the
Federals. Richmond papers of the 23rd state that Goldsborough had been
evacuated but was not occupied by Sherman. General Schofield is said
to have succeeded in joining General Sherman, his force forming the
right wing of Sherman's army.</p>
<p>Stoneman's cavalry, 6000 strong, have left Knoxville, and are
moving towards Western Virginia. Ten thousand Federal cavalry have
left Eastport, Mississippi, to destroy the remaining railroads in
Alabama and Mississippi.</p>
<p>Sheridan had arrived at White House, after doing a great deal of
damage to the railways. A cavalry force sent out to form a junction
with him had been unable to do so. A statement is made which, if true,
is of great importance. It is that a Federal cavalry force was at
Burkesville, the junction of the Richmond, Danville, Petersburg, and
Lynchburg railroads.</p>
<p>The Confederates' claim successes in Florida and Louisiana.</p>
<p>A report reached Memphis on the 24th ult. from Hollyspring that
Mobile had been evacuated, and that the city, with an immense quantity
of war material, was in possession of the Federals.</p>
<p>Two negro companies have been paraded at Richmond, and the
impression was that they would make good soldiers.</p>
<p>President Lincoln has visited General Grant at City Point, for the
benefit of his health, it is said.</p>
<p>The Confederate Congress has replied to President Davis's message,
stating that they will defend their action on all legislative
questions. They blame Davis for want of promptitude in making known
the wants of the country and censure the admonitions contained in his
message as being calculated to create discord and dissension. The
Congress has issued an encouraging address to the people declaring
that the conquest of the Confederacy is geographically
impracticable. Confidence is expressed for the achievement of their
independence and maintenance as a separate nation. A bill was also
passed authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow three
millions in coin for the army supplies. If so much cannot be borrowed

demanded satisfaction for the firing upon the Niagara and Sacramento
by the Portuguese forts after the Federal vessels had signalled that
they understood the first signal from the fort. He also requests the
dismissal of the Governor of Fort Belem, and a salute of twenty-one

Parties and its Men," evidently written by some one having access to
special sources of information...."A Visit to the Army of the James"
is another very interesting paper, giving a fair insight into the
management of an American army on active service. The very favourable
estimate of General Butler's character will surprise most readers. It
is, of course, pretty well understood by this time that the General
was most unfairly vituperated for his conduct in New Orleans to serve
the ends of those who were desirous of involving us in a war with
America, but certainly few will be prepared to meet with so many
traits of real magnanimity as are here recorded of him. An article on
"Regulars and Volunteers" is also full of allusions to the American
war, viewed as a huge experiment of the working of a volunteer
army. It is highly interesting....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> present two illustrations of the
proceedings at Washington upon the recent occasion when Mr. Lincoln
inaugurated his second term of office as President of the United
States. Our first Engraving shows the scene in front of the Capitol,
on Saturday, March 4--the reading of the President's address to the
people assembled in the open street beneath the portico of that
stately palace of the Federal Legislature. Mr. Lincoln himself will be
at once distinguished. He is standing with a paper in his hand behind
the small table on which a glass of water is placed; and the two
gentlemen seated in front, a little to the left hand of the view, are
the ex Vice-President, Mr. Hamlin; and the new Vice-President,
Mr. Andrew Johnson, who had made rather an unfortunate exhibition of
himself in the Senate House a few minutes before. The Secretary of
State, Mr. Seward, with Mr. Stanton the Secretary for War, and
Mr. Welles, the Secretary for the Navy, are standing together near the
lamp-post, in the right-hand portion of the View. The row of seven or
eight gentlemen seated in front, between the President and the Cabinet
Ministers, are Chief Justice Chase and the Judges of the Supreme
Court. The members of the Senate, those belonging to the foreign
Legations, and a miscellaneous crowd of gentlemen and ladies behind,
occupy the remainder of the elevated space. The weather had been
stormy and showery till within an hour of noon; but at the time of
this ceremony there was an interval of bright sunshine. The reading of
the address did not occupy ten minutes. It was received with loud
acclamations; a salute of 100 guns was then fired, and President
Lincoln, entering his carriage, went home to his official residence,
called the White House.</p>
<p>Our second Illustration is an interior view of the great north hall
of the Patent Office at Washington, in which a grand ball took place
on the Monday evening, March 6, in honour of the President, as is
customary at the beginning of each President's term of office. This
vast apartment was chosen for the dancing, because it is nearly 100
ft. in width; but its aspect is not so magnificent as that of the
south or central hall, or that of the east hall in the same building,
which were used for the promenade. The north hall, which was occupied
as a Government hospital in 1861 and 1862, has lately been put in
order for the exhibition therein of a collection of patented
articles. The floor is laid with a blue and white marble pavement; the
walls had been freshly painted, and were hung with a series of
banners, displaying those national emblems, the stars and stripes, in
alternate festoons, midway between the ceiling and the floor. Between
the windows were ranged the guidons, or small hand-flags, of the
various army corps, brigades, and regiments of the United States
service, while miniature American flags were crossed and placed at
intervals on the walls. On a balcony over the main entrance was
stationed a fine military band; and midway in the hall on another
balcony, tastefully decorated with bunting, was placed the
orchestra. On a raised dais immediately opposite the latter balcony,
and on the northern side of the hall, were handsome sofas of blue and
gold, which were intended as seats of honour for the President and his
suite. The gaslights were arranged on seven pipes extending across the
hall, a few feet from the ceiling. Dressing-rooms for the ladies were
prepared along the sides of the promenade-halls. The President and
distinguished guests, according to the arrangements of the committee,
entered the building from Seventh, the remainder from F street. At
nine o'clock the crowd began to assemble in the ball-room and to take
their seats on the single line of benches which went all round the
room.</p>
<p>The ladies' dresses are said to have displayed a great variety of
invention; some ladies wore their hair powdered with gold-dust. The
dancing began at a quarter to ten. The President and Mrs. Lincoln,
with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Mr. Charles
Sumner, arrived at a quarter past ten. The President wore a full suit
of black, with white kid gloves; Mrs. Lincoln wore a white lace dress
over a white silk skirt and bodice, a berthe of point lace, and
necklace of pearls, with a wreath of white jessamine, purple violets,
and trailing vines upon her head. At eleven o'clock Mr. Seward, the
Secretary of State; Mr. Welles, the Secretary for the Navy; the
Attorney-General, and other members of the Cabinet, with some of the
foreign Ministers and their ladies, entered the hall; but fresh
arrivals continued till midnight. The supper-tables, loaded with a
profusion of artistic confectionery, were laid out in the hall in the
west wing of the building. The most conspicuous forms of architectural
pastry were a model of the Capitol for the centrepiece, with
emblematic sculptures on the four sides of the pedestal; and two
monumental structures, which were dedicated respectively to the honour
of the United States army and of the United States navy, displaying
various scenes and implements of warfare, with portraits of several
distinguished commanders by land and sea. The central hall and the
east hall were gorgeously decorated--the ceilings and cornices being
painted most elaborately with combinations of red and yellow, blue and
green, while the immense pillars were coloured ultramarine. These
halls were, of course, brilliantly lighted, and, when thronged with
gaily-dressed people, had a very splendid effect. The profits derived
from the sale of tickets went towards the relief of the sick and
wounded of the Federal army.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>By the City of London we have intelligence from New York to the 1st
inst., when gold was quoted at 151&#x00BC;.</p>
<p>Active operations have been begun before Petersburg, where the two
armies had long lain supine. On the morning of the 25th ult., Lee
suddenly attacked Grant's centre and captured Fort Steadman. The
Confederates, flushed with this success, pushed on, captured a
battery, and turned the guns on the Federals. They were, however,
driven out from the battery, and their attacks on Fort Askell were
repulsed. The Federals then assumed the offensive, and, having been
reinforced, not only drove the Confederates out of Fort Steadman, but
captured their picket-line beyond, and held it. The Federal account
says the guns of Fort Steadman were uninjured; but General Lee, in his
account, states they were disabled. The loss on both sides was
heavy. General Grant estimates the slaughter of the Confederates at
the point where they entered the Federal lines at 3000 men; his own
loss altogether being put at 2000. The Federal troops in front of
Petersburg, having been relieved by corps brought from the north bank
of the James River, marched, on the 29th ult. towards the Federal
left; and the result of their day's march was, as we are told, that
they established themselves on a line parallel with the Boydton Plank
Road, and west of Hatcher's Run. The Confederate pickets were driven
in; and the Confederates who attacked General Griffin's division on
the Quaker Road, were repulsed with severe loss--the Federals losing
some 250 men in killed and wounded during the day, and capturing about
one hundred prisoners. The Confederates were believed to be in strong
force near Gravelly Run, and a heavy engagement was expected; but,
although firing was heard at City Point on the 30th ult., it was
supposed that operations had been interrupted by rain. General
Sheridan's cavalry had accompanied the march of the Federals, and had
been last heard of at Dinwiddie Courthouse, with the supposed
intention of cutting the Southside Railway.</p>
<p>President Lincoln, Secretary Seward, and Generals Grant, Sherman,
and Sheridan have had an interview at City Point. Rumours of peace
negotiations were again current, but a New York telegram of the 31st
ult. states it to have been "semi-officially denied that General Lee
has demanded a peace conference." The Spanish and British Ministers
accompanied Mr. Seward to City Point.</p>
<p>General Sherman, it is announced, had had hard and continued
fighting since leaving Fayetteville, but he had formed a junction with
the corps of Generals Schofield and Terry at Goldsborough, which had
been occupied by General Schofield on the 2nd ult. and there, it is
stated, the armies were resting to refit, the campaign having been a
glorious success. General Sherman had issued an order of the day,
dated near Bentonville, on the 22nd ult., in which he stated that the
concentrated armies of the enemy had upon the 21st been beaten upon
their chosen ground, and were fleeing in disorder, leaving their dead
and wounded, and burning the bridges in their retreat. General Sherman
had quitted his army and proceeded to City Point, where, as stated
above, he held a council on March 27, with President Lincoln, General
Grant, and General Sheridan, and afterwards returned to
Goldsborough.</p>
<p>General Thomas has effected a junction with Gillen at Knoxville,
and the ultimate object of this combined movement is believed to be
the capture of Lynchburg.</p>
<p>The Federal forces advanced against Mobile on the 18th ult., and,
from heavy firing which was heard on the 21st, it was believed that
the attack had commenced. Mobile is said to be provisioned for a xix
months' siege.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>A Montreal telegram of March 30 states that the St. Albans raiders
had been discharged on the ground that they were belligerents. They
were no sooner at liberty, however, than they were re-arrested on a
charge of violent assault, with intent to commit murder....</p>

<p>....The next matter in which Victoria will appear to a disadvantage
at home is the treatment which the commander of the Confederate
war-steamer, the Shenandoah, received at the hands of our
Government. In my last letter the arrival of the Shenandoah, with,
probably, Captain Semmes on board, was announced. It appears I was
mistaken as to Captain Semmes, the vessel being under the command of
Captain Waddell, who, as soon as he anchored in Hobson's
Bay,communicated the fact of his arrival to the Governor, and asked
permission to have the machinery overhauled, and to take in
stores. Permission to do both was granted. After being some twelve or
fourteen days in port, and while the vessel was on the patent slip
undergoing the repairs that were deemed necessary, and which were
sanctioned by Government commissioners, rumours were circulated to
the effect that a number of men had been induced to join the
Confederate service. It appears the information was supplied by some
deserters, and upon the information so furnished, a warrant was issued
for the apprehension of one named "Charlie," who was declared to be on
board wearing the uniform of the ship. The execution of the warrant
was intrusted to an officer of police, who, on going on board, was in
the absence of the captain, refused permission to search the ship. On
the following morning the Officer presented himself, when he saw
Captain Waddell, who informed him that it was contrary to the rules of
the service that a vessel of war should be searched; but at the same
time, he gave his word of honour as an officer and a gentleman that no
other men than his own crew were on board. The Government, not content
with this declaration, and believing that the Foreign Enlistment Act
as well as the Neutrality Laws, had been violated, sent a force of
military and police, with instructions that they were to allow no
person to afford any aid in launching the vessel, unless the search
was allowed or "Charlie" given up. This caused considerable
excitement; but still Captain Waddell refused permission to
search. Late on the same night four men were seen to leave the
vessel. They were pursued and captured and one of them was identified
as the man "Charlie" for whom the warrant had been issued. The
military and police were then withdrawn, and the Shenandoah was
launched on the following day; but not until a great deal of
correspondence had passed between the Commander and the
Government. Captain Waddell complained of the insulting tone of the
correspondence, and has intimated his intention of bringing the whole
matter before the Richmond Government. It is declared by the Commander
and officers that the men arrested were stowaways, and that their
presence on board was unknown to anyone, they being only discovered
after a third search. The four men were brought before the
Williamstown Police Court charged with committing a breach of the
Foreign Enlistment Act. Three of them were committed for trial, the
fourth, being an American, was discharged. It is said that the
Government of Victoria intend laying the case before the Imperial
Government. The public sympathy is all with Captain Waddell. The
Shenandoah sailed from Hobson's Bay on the morning of the 18th inst.,
with, it is well known, a considerable addition to her crew. She is
said to be lying off our coast, waiting the arrival of some Federal
vessels consigned to American merchants, at whose instigation, it is
alleged, the Government took the proceedings against Captain Waddell,
of which such a mess has been made. The Government did either too much
or too little. They ought to have been sure of their information being
well founded before seizing the Shenandoah, and, if they were correct
in the first step, they would have been warranted in retaining
possession of her. By their conduct they have equally offended North
and South.</p></div2>

<p>The quarterly monthly returns of the emigration from Liverpool show
an enormous decrease, as compared with the corresponding period of
last year. Twenty-one ships sailed, under the Act, for the United
States during the last month, with 6872 passengers, of whom 1445 were
English, 519 Scotch, 528 Irish, and 1053 belonging to other
countries. To Victoria there were two ships, with 503 passengers, of
whom 188 were English, twenty-one Scotch, 283 Irish, and four
belonging to other countries. To South America there was one ship,
with seventy-one passengers, sixty-eight of whom wore steerage and
three cabin; and, of the whole, four were English, the remainder
belonged to other countries. Of "short" ships there were six to the
United States, with 311 passengers; one to Victoria, with twenty-four passengers; one to the West Indies, with seven passengers; one to
South America, with fifty-five passengers; and one to Africa, with
fifty-five passengers. The total number of emigrants was 7878,
against 14,488 in the corresponding month of last year. In the last
quarter there sailed, under the Act, 14,516, while in the
corresponding quarter of 1864 the number was 26,547.</p></div2>

rend="smallcaps">Lisbon Harbour.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">It</hi> has been mentioned that the Portuguese
fort of Belem, at the entrance of Lisbon Harbour, fired upon the
American Federal ships of war Niagara and Sacramento, when the
Governor of the fort believed that they were about to break the
neutrality of the harbour by going out in pursuit of the Confederate
vessel Stonewall. The Portuguese Government has since apologised, and
dismissed the Governor from his post. We have received from a Lisbon
correspondent, Mr. Henry Jauncey, the drawing which we have engraved,
and it is accompanied with the following letter:--</p>
<p rend="right">"Lisbon, March 28, 1865.</p>
<p>"The Confederate steam-ram Stonewall having come into this port on
the 26th, and thinking a likeness of her might prove acceptable to
you, I take the liberty of forwarding one, which I flatter myself is a
faithful one. The Stonewall is a steam-ram of about 1200 tons
measurement, brig-rigged, and of 500-horse power, capable of working
up as high as 1700. She carries three guns mounted--two 70-pounder
Armstrong guns in the turret abaft the mainmast, and one 300-pounder
Armstrong gun in the forecastle, just over the "ram;" this gun can
also be trained as a broadside gun, and is a most formidable piece of
artillery. The turret is not a movable one, but the guns can be
trained to bear either fore or aft, or as broadside guns likewise. She
is plated with 5&#x00BD;  in. iron plates, and 6 in. forward. The
"ram" projects about 18 ft. under the water line, and is very sharp;
it gradually rounds off to the deck, and is surmounted by the
300-pounder. She steams very fast, the officers say thirteen knots at
sea. The Stonewall was built, at Bordeaux, for the Danish navy; but,
not being finished in time, was rejected by the Danes, and then was
bought by the Confederates. She has just come down from Ferrol, where
she had been repairing; and the Niagara and Sacramento, who have been
on the look out for her, arrived last evening. They cannot leave the
port now till twenty-four hours after the sailing of the Stonewall,
and are both off Belem with steam up, as are also the Portuguese
corvettes Sagres and Mindello. The Stonewall is commanded by Captain
T. J. Page, of the Confederate navy, and has a strong company of
officers and men. They show every attention to the numerous visitors
who have gone on board. She has been ordered by the Portuguese
Government to leave in twenty four hours, and is now going out, and
the Niagara and Sacramento cannot leave till twenty-four hours
after. I show in the sketch, besides the Stonewall, the Portuguese
corvette Sagres and the Federals Niagara and Sacramento, and, in the
distance, Fort St. Julian's and the Bugio Lighthouse."</p>
<p>On reference to our Illustration, it should be observed that the
Sacramento and Niagara are seen to the left hand, the Niagara being
the nearer of the two; while the Bugio Lighthouse is seen in the
distance, between the Niagara and the Stonewall; the Portuguese
corvette and Fort St. Julian are shown to the right hand of the
View.</p></div2>

<p>....It is probably not within the memory of many experienced
Parliamentarians that the Army and Navy Estimates have been left
unfinished at the Easter recess. As regards the Army Estimates, the
delay has arisen out of the singular infelicity of the vote of
&#x00A3;50,000 for the defences of Canada, which could be of avail in
no possible way--unless, indeed, it was intended as an artful mode of
testing the opinion of the House on the question of general policy. If
that be the case, Government have had what they wished to their
heart's content. The fourth discussion on the subject as initiated by
Lord Elcho last week, was dull in comparison with those which had
previously gone before, although it was as full as ever of that
curious argument that Canada is to be defended by England, but that
England is wholly incapable of defending Canada. The debate was
notable for a reproduction of a statement that, without being aware of
it, the country has in its midst a modern Wolfe--a young soldier who
has all the qualifications of that heaven-born commander, except that
he decidedly objects to fight upon the same ground on which Wolfe was
victorious. According to Lord Elcho, even such a man is to be found in
the person of Major Anson, member for Lichfield, who did the House the
honour of iterating the speech which he made on a former evening, and
which, as interpreted by Sir John Pakington, means that the British
soldier in Canada should immediately perfect himself in a
man&#x0153;uvre not hitherto specially included in his training--that
of running away. The most satisfactory contribution to the debate was
the speech of Mr. Kinglake, which, as usual, was so diplomatically
shaped that no one could tell in the least which way he leaned, and
one heartily wishes that all the rest of the speakers had been equally
unintelligible to those persons who are, it may be supposed, most
interested in knowing exactly what England will do in the event of an
invasion of Canada....</p></div2>

following clause:--"Art. 10.--As, by the laws of the kingdom of
Portugal and of the republic of Liberia, the slave trade is
assimilated to piracy, the vessels or subjects of both the aforesaid
countries that may be found employed in this infamous trade shall be
tried and punished by the courts of their respective countries
according to the aforesaid laws." It is remarkable that the two negro
republics of Hayti and Liberia were the States which first States
which set the example of introducing this provision into an
international treaty of commerce, though England, America, and other
States have declared the slave trade to be piracy by their statute law
and several of the Powers have made special treaties for the
suppression of the slave trade. The Republic of Liberia, as our
readers are probably aware, owed its existence to the efforts of the
American Colonisation Society, which has from time to time, since it
was established, some forty years ago, sent out large numbers of
emancipated negroes from the United States, and settled them on the
coast of Africa, to form an independent political community. The
President now is Mr. Warner since the death of the late President
Benson, who was an able and enlightened man. The population is about
half a million, chiefly speaking English. Their little capital city,
named Monrovia, is a place of some trade, and furnished with churches,
schools, colleges, newspapers, and other civilised institutions,
besides being the seat of Government, with a Senate and House of
Representatives holding session there. The Republic has no standing
army, but all its citizens, except clergymen and judges, are bound to
serve in the militia, to which the Emperor of the French has presented
1500 muskets; while the sole vessel of the Liberian navy, a schooner
of five guns, is a gift from the Queen of Great Britain. It is
gratifying to hear good accounts of this experiment of self-government
for the negro race.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE DEFEAT OF GENERAL LEE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> gallant Generalissimo of the
Confederate forces has sustained what may fairly be regarded as his
first, and what will probably prove to be his last, defeat in
defensive warfare. As the ablest and most accomplished commander which
the civil war has produced, the public, without distinction of
parties, is at some loss whether most to admire his long and almost
unbroken career of successful defence, or to commiserate him under the
inevitable catastrophe that has broken his power. For General Lee's
qualities were of that high order, and were so happily balanced, that
he not merely won the respect, but elicited the sympathy, of the
civilised world. But for the spirit which he breathed into his
soldiers and the confidence in his invincibility with which he had
inspired the South, the course of Secession would, perhaps, have been
a shorter one, but it is doubtful if it would have retained to the
close that heroic character which has enlisted so large an amount of
feeling in its favour. He put upon the contest the stamp of his
nobility. Whether he would have counselled his compatriots to submit
their differences with the North to the arbitrement of war may be
questioned; but, that decision having been taken, his patriotism
instantly proscribed for him his line of duty. Along that line he has
unfalteringly marched, not, indeed, to final victory, but to highest
glory; and probably, when the din of arms has ceased, and the gaping
wounds through which the life-blood of the Republic still flows have
been closed and healed, the one name which will be remembered with
most pride and veneration in connection with this gigantic struggle
will be that of General Lee.</p>
<p>The evacuation of Petersburg and. Richmond has for some weeks past
been looked upon as mainly a question of time. Sherman's march
northward from Savannah and Sheridan's clearance of the Shenandoah
Valley indicated clearly enough that no generalship could ultimately
avail to make a single army an equal match for the three that were
gathering round it. And yet the event was not foreshadowed, at least
in the form in which it happened, by public expectation. Whilst it was
easy to foresee that the superior numbers, the larger resources, and
the untiring pertinacity of the Federals must, in the end, overbear
Lee's position, in spite of the most consummate strategical skill, it
was hardly anticipated that he would himself begin the fight which has
had for him and for his army such a disastrous termination. The
dashing assault of Fort Steadman, early on the 25th ult., which,
together with two minor works, the Confederates captured, but were
unable to retain, seems to have precipitated the crisis. Whether it
was a desperate venture with the hope of seizing Grant's military
railway at City Point, and thereby compelling him to abandon the whole
of his line south of the Appomattox; or whether political reasons of
which we have yet received no information prevailed upon Lee to assume
the offensive, the effect appears to have been to produce conviction
on Grant's mind that the time had come for him to strike with all the
force he could command. This conviction, it may be assumed, was
converted into a resolution at the council of war held, on the 27th,
at which Mr. Lincoln and General Sherman were present. On the 30th,
Sheridan, after several ineffectual attempts to cut the Southside
railroad, in one of which the Federals were forced back in confusion
on the Boydton Plank-road, succeeded in routing the Confederates and
gaining the important position at which he had aimed. His success
having been reported, Grant ordered an attack along the whole
line. The battle raged furiously until the evening of April 2, and
during the night Petersburg and Richmond were both evacuated. The
losses on both sides were great, but, as might have been expected, the
vanquished suffered most severely, especially in the number of
prisoners taken.</p>
<p>Since the commencement of the war no battle has been fought the
result of which was so calculated to fill the hearts of the
Confederates with dismay as the three days' conflict in the
neighbourhood of Petersburg. Whilst Lee's army remained unconquered,
Secessia naturally refused to give up hope. The capture of Vicksburg,
of Atlanta, of Savannah, of Wilmington, of Charleston, successively
deepened the gloom which hung over her prospects; but there was one
bright spot to which she could always turn with some confidence in her
forecast of her probable destiny. Other Generals might be
unsuccessful, other armies might be beaten and scattered, but whilst
General Lee continued at the head of those troops which he had so
often led to victory it was, no doubt, difficult for the Southerners
to believe that the cause for which they had made so many sacrifices,
and which had lived through so many fluctuations, had become
desperate. They looked wistfully towards him as the living freight of
a tempest-tossed vessel might look towards the pilot who has weathered
the wildest storms, and whilst he grasped the helm and maintained a
cheerful countenance, trust in his marvellous sagacity and in the good
fortune which had waited upon it served to give buoyancy to their
courage and forbade their yielding place to despair. Lee's defeat,
with the loss of perhaps half his army, is the heaviest reverse which
has ever befallen them, because it throws its ominous shadow so far
forward into the future. There is no visible reserve upon which he can
fall back; and, although he may yet achieve brilliant military feats,
it would appear most unlikely that he will be able to save from
dissolution that unity of national organisation, to conserve and
consolidate which his heroic energies have hitherto been devoted.</p>
<p>It would appear in the highest degree improbable that the
Confederacy can hope to win back by a continuance of the struggle the
good fortune they have lost. Late events have strongly indicated that
their strength is well-nigh exhausted. For four years they have
endured a strain upon their vitality far beyond reasonable
expectation. Indeed, until within the last twelvemonth, it seemed that
no external force could succeed in piercing the line behind which the
non-combatant population was sheltered. Sherman pierced it, and found
that the interior of the shell was hollow. His march through Georgia
to the coast, and from the coast upward, into the heart of North
Carolina, demonstrated that the whole military strength of the
Confederacy had been placed upon the frontier and that no means of
effectual resistance would avail it if General Lee's force were
destroyed. That calamity has now befallen it. The North Virginian
army, the hope and stay of the Southern States, has at last, after a
most gallant resistance, been shattered and driven forth from the
capital and its outposts. The defeat seems irreversible--at least, as
far as visible probabilities can throw light upon it. The Legislature
is scat<pb n="366"/>tered; the President is in flight; the organised
force of the nation is disintegrated and, comparatively speaking,
dispersed; and, what is worse, should its several parts once more come
together, although it might obtain favourable terms, it could hardly
restore to the South another momentary chance of establishing her
separate independence.</p>
<p>In truth, the moat recent tidings from the scene of conflict point
with more than common significance to the probability that the end is
drawing nigh. Sheridan, followed by Meade, pursued Lee in his retreat
with dogged perseverance, and, two or three days after the evacuation
of Petersburg, found the Confederates at the intersection of
Burkeville-station road with the road upon which they were retiring
drawn up to resist him. Connecting his cavalry with two divisions of
the 6th Army Corps, he instantly attacked them and forced them from
their position, capturing six generals and making several thousand
prisoners. General Lee was reported to have posted the remains of his
force a little later on the heights beyond Sailor's Creek, having
previously destroyed the bridges across the stream. It may be
conjectured that he will have reached Lynchburg without further
serious molestation, and within its strongly-fortified lines he will
have time to survey all the possibilities which late events have left
him. His outlook, however, cannot but be a gloomy one, even on the
supposition that matters during the next month turn out more
fortunately for him than he might feel himself warranted to
anticipate. No doubt, if the Southern population, instead of being
paralysed by despair, should be roused by the losses they have
sustained to new determination, the North would still have a work of
immense difficulty before it. But if the conduct of the Congress that
lately sat at Richmond can be regarded as furnishing a key to the
feelings of the people they ostensibly represented, the inference
seems unavoidable that no supreme effort of self-sacrifice is to be
expected.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the friends of humanity can scarcely
desire that the contest should be prolonged. Gallantry has done its
best and failed; may not wisdom now step forward and accept the issue?
There is no lack of honourable precedents for such a course. Waste of
blood is always to be deprecated; and perhaps the most brilliant
courage, when unavailing, is most strikingly set off by a frank
acquiescence in arrangements which it has tried its utmost to
prevent. But it lies chiefly with the North to facilitate a return to
peace and unity. There is no hour so favourable for magnanimity as
that of decisive victory. There is no generosity which can penetrate
the heart like the generosity of superior power in the full flush of
success. The occasion is one which devolves on President Lincoln a
responsibility commensurate with the glorious opportunity put within
his reach by General Grant's triumph. That he will be indisposed to
recognise it we have no present reason for suspecting. Words of
conciliation will best become his lips at this juncture--words fitted
to calm down apprehension, to soothe wounded pride, and to replace a
hope that is crushed by another that may be gratefully
welcomed.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">GENERAL GRANT.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant</hi>, the
Commander-in-Chief of the Federal armies is a native of the State of
Ohio, and was born in the year 1828. He was educated for his
profession in the United States Military Academy at West Point, in the
State of New York. After leaving that institution, he received his
appointment as Lieutenant in the 4th Infantry in 1845, and served with
much credit throughout the Mexican War. In 1847 he was appointed
Quarter-Master of his regiment, but soon afterwards left the service
and settled in the State of Illinois, where he carried on the business
of a tanner. When the civil war broke out, in 1861, he volunteered for
active service, and obtained the command of the 2nd Volunteer Regiment
of Illinois, but was presently advanced to the rank of
Major-General. In the battle of Belmont, on the Mississippi, fought in
November of that year, he was opposed to the Confederate Generals
Pillow and Polk; and, though he was compelled to retreat before a very
superior force, he gave proofs of a high degree of judgment and
military skill. The capture of Fort Henry, on the Tennessee River, and
Fort Donnelson, on the Cumberland River, in the course of that winter
placed the whole of the State of Kentucky and a great part of the
State of Tennessee in the secure possession of the Federal Government;
and the merit of these achievements belongs to General Grant, though
he was materially assisted by the gun-boat squadron. On the 6th and
7th of April, 1862, was fought the battle of Shiloh, near Corinth, one
of the fiercest and bloodiest conflicts of the war--General Grant
having to contend with Beauregard and Sydney Johnston, who had united
their armies to crush him before he could be joined by Buell. On this
memorable occasion he sustained for twenty hours the attack of their
combined forces, which greatly outnumbered his own, and succeeded in
holding his ground until General Buell came up, when a complete
victory rewarded the constancy and courage of the Federal
commander. His next great performance was the siege of Vicksburg, in
the early part of 1863. His plan for the reduction of that fortress,
which Sherman had in vain attempted the year before, involved a march
of 150 miles through the hostile country of Mississippi State, so as
to arrive at the rear of Vicksburg. The misconduct of Pemberton, the
Confederate General in command of Vicksburg, and the insufficient
strength of General Joseph Johnston, who was to have raised the siege,
contributed to the successful issue of Grant's bold enterprise, which
had seemed one of the greatest hazard. He remained in Mississippi,
having the chief command of the Federal armies in the south-western
States during the autumn and winter of 1863; and, as soon as the
position of Chattanooga had fallen into the hands of the Federals, he
conceived the design of sending Sherman, then Brigadier-General, to
invade North Georgia, whence the Confederate armies were drawing their
principal supply of munitions and <hi rend="italic">mat&#x00E9;riel</hi> of war. The execution of this plan
was hindered for some months, having been postponed to that of the
march towards Mobile, which produced no useful result. Meantime Grant
was recalled to Washington, to take the supreme command of all the
Federal armies, which, with the rank of Lieutenant-General, was
conferred upon him in the spring of 1864. Within eight weeks from the
date of this commission he began his celebrated march to Richmond,
having divided his army into two columns, one of which crossed the
Rapidan, seventy miles from the Confederate capital, and plunged
headforemost into the midst of the intrenched positions of the enemy;
while the other, having been conveyed by sea to Fortress Monroe,
advanced towards Richmond along the banks of the James River. The
frightful carnage which befell the first division of Grant's army in
the battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, and Cold Harbour, from
the 5th of May to the 3rd of June last year, shocked all feelings of
humanity, and brought some reproach upon Grant, as reckless of the
lives of his soldiers. General Grant, however, disregarding these
complaints, persisted in the campaign, which has now been brought to a
termination. Finding it hopeless to attack Richmond by the direct road
from the north, he turned aside to the left hand, and, in spite of
heavy losses, contrived to reach the banks of the James River, which
have since formed his base of operations. The town of Petersburg, some
twenty miles to the south of Richmond, has been the point most
obstinately contested in the circuit of the Confederate defences. It
is doubtful how much longer the resistance of General Lee might have
been prolonged but for the approach of Sherman's army, which has
recently obliged Lee to detach from the lines before Richmond a
considerable part of his force. The result, which seems likely to put
an end to the war, is the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, which
took place during the first two or three days of this month. There
can be little doubt of the high military abilities of General Grant,
and still less of the extraordinary degree of resolution and
perseverance which he has displayed in these most arduous and
difficult undertakings. The Portrait engraved on our front page is

<p>We were able to announce in a part of our Town Edition last week
that General Lee had sustained a great defeat, and that Petersburg and
Richmond had been evacuated by the Confederates and occupied by the
victorious Federals. It was already known that there had been much
hard fighting on the 31st ult. between General Grant's extreme left,
under General Sheridan, and the Confederates, but that there had been
no great result. On the 1st inst. the engagement was renewed, and in
the afternoon General Sheridan cut the Confederate right at Five Forks
Station, on the Southside Railway, and captured several thousand
prisoners and some guns. At an early hour on the morning of the 2nd
inst., a general attack was made on the Confederate lines in front of
Petersburg, and was successful after very severe fighting, the
Confederates retiring into the intrenchments immediately about
Petersburg. During the night the city was evacuated, and on the
morning of the 3rd inst. it was occupied by the Federals. Richmond had
also been evacuated at the same time, and was likewise <sic>occcupied</sic> by
General Weitzel's Federal corps on the morning of the 3rd inst. The
Confederates had blown up their vessels of war at Richmond and
Petersburg, had destroyed most of the bridges, and had burned large
quantities of tobacco and stores. Nothing was accurately known as to
the amount of the losses on each side, but on the 4th inst. General
Grant estimated that his entire losses up to that date would not
exceed 7000 men killed, wounded, and missing. He added that on the
previous day more than 2000 Confederates were made prisoners; and in a
previous despatch of the 2nd inst. he had stated that up to that time
his army had<pb n="367"/> taken at least 12,000 prisoners. The
correspondents of the New York newspapers asserted that the
Confederates had lost altogether 25,000 prisoners and 15,000 killed or
wounded. According to the latest news from New York (to the 8th inst.)
Generals Grant, Sheridan, and Meade were in hot pursuit of the
Confederates, capturing prisoners by the thousand.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Details Of The Battles.</hi></p>
<p>The New York correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>,
writing on the 5th inst., thus describes the opening battles of the
great Federal victory:--</p>
<q><p>Sheridan left in the night (of Tuesday, March 25), with his
whole cavalry force, to make an attempt to reach the Southside
Railroad. Most people imagined his destination was Burkesville, the
point of junction between the Southside and Danville roads. He passed
Dinwiddie Courthouse on Wednesday morning, all well; but it now began
to leak out that he was not going to Burkesville at all, but was
simply engaged in an attempt to turn Lee's right flank. On Wednesday
afternoon the rain set in; the roads in two hours were converted into
a quagmire, and so, of course, was the country round them. This
delayed his march seriously, revealed the nature of his movement to
the enemy, and, in fact, precipitated the crisis. On the same day the
whole army of the Potomac moved out of its old position, except two
corps left to hold the intrenchment, and pushed off in the old style
to the left, and bivouacing that night on the northward side of the
Vaughan-road.</p>
<p>It had by this time, doubtless, become apparent to Lee where Grant
was, and he made his preparations to foil him with his usual
energy. Pickett's  division, one of the largest in his army, was sent
to look after Sheridan; it found him with trains stuck in the mud, his
horses in much the same fix, the men living on hard biscuits and
drenched with twenty-four hours' rain. The 6th Corps, under General
Warren, had been sent in support of him. It was to seize the White
Oak-road and hold it while a brigade of the cavalry pushed into the
railroad at Five Forks; but the infantry did not come up, or was
repulsed, some say owing to the rain; others, owing to Warren's
disobedience of orders or remissness. Sheridan evidently took the
latter view of it, for he relieved him of his command on the following
day. As soon as it was disposed of, the enemy flung the whole of
Pickett's division on Sheridan. The country was thickly wooded, most
of the ground impracticable for cavalry, whose light carbines, if they
were dismounted, could do little against the Confederate
rifles. Sheridan was pressed hard during the day, losing, perhaps, a
thousand men and a good deal of ground, and was only enabled to stop
his retreat near nightfall by the arrival of Custer with two fresh
brigades. So far the movement had not been very prosperous.</p>
<p>Thursday was a comparatively quiet day. Little was done beyond
skirmishing. Lee was probably occupied in massing his troops, while
the Federals were fairly mud-bound. The 5th Corps held a position
between Gravelly Run and Hatcher's Run, about a mile north of the
junction of the Quaker road and Boydton road.</p>
<p>At daylight on Friday morning a column composed of Wise's and
Johnson's divisions, and one from Pickett's corps, flung itself upon
it, and drove Crawford's and Ayre's division in confusion from the
field for nearly two miles. They were not rallied till the afternoon,
and then only south of the Boydton road. The offensive was resumed,
with the assistance of the 2nd Corps, and, after a desperate conflict,
the enemy was driven in, and at nightfall the Federals had advanced
their position so as to hold the White Oak-road.</p></q>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Battle At The Five
Forks.</hi></p>
<p>On Friday night General Grant, dissatisfied, like most other
observers on the Federal side, with the day's business, placed
General Sheridan in the supreme command of the whole of Warren's corps
and all the cavalry. The brilliant contest of Saturday is most vividly
narrated in the following extract from the report furnished by the
correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">New York World</hi>:--</p>
<q><p>At daybreak on Saturday Sheridan fired four signal-guns to
admonish Warren he was off; and his cavalry, by diverging roads,
struck their camps. Just south of Culpepper is a certain Stony Creek,
the tributaries to which wind northward and control the roads. Over
Stony Creek went Crook, making the longest detour. Custer took a
bottom called Chamberlain's Bed; an Devin advanced from Little Five
Forks--the whole driving the rebels towards the left of their works on
White Oak road.</p>
<p>We must start with the supposition that our own men far outnumbered
the rebels. The latter were widely separated from their comrades
before Petersburg, and it was a part of our scheme to push them back
into their intrenchments. This work was delegated to the cavalry
entirely; but mounted carabineers are no match for stubborn, bayoneted
infantry. So when the horsemen were close up to the rebels they were
dismounted and acted as infantry. All the afternoon the cavalry pushed
them hard, and the strife went on uninterruptedly and
terrifically.</p>
<p>Through wood, and brake, and swamp; across field and trench (says
the Correspondent), we pushed the fighting defenders steadily. For a
part of the time Sheridan himself was there, short and broad, and
active, waving his hat, giving orders, seldom out of fire, but never
stationary; and close by fell the long, yellow locks of Custer, sabre
extended, fighting like a Viking, though he was worn and haggard with
much work.</p></q>
<p>After a time Sheridan got overwhelming forces to bear upon the
Southern position, and forced a crisis which is thus finely described
by the same writer, whose descriptions, graphic as they are, must have
been penned with extraordinary quickness and promptitude to reach us
by the same mail as brings the telegraphic summary of the same
news. He says:--</p>
<q><p>Little by little, Sheridan, extending his lines, drove the whole
rebel force into their breastworks; then he dismounted the mass of his
cavalry and charged the works, straight in front, still thundering on
their flank. At last every rebel was safe behind his
intrenchments. Then the signal was given, and concealed infantry, many
thousand strong, sprang up and advanced by echelon to the
right. Imagine a great barn-door shutting to, and you have the
movement, if you can also imagine the door itself, hinge and all,
moving forward also. At six o'clock the whole corps column came crash
upon the full flank of the astonished rebels. Now came the pitch of
the battle. We were already on the rebel right in force, and thinly in
their rear. Our carabineers were making feint to charge in direct
front, and our infantry, four deep, hemmed in their entire left. All
this they did not for an instant note, so thorough was their
confusion; but, seeing it directly, they, so far from giving up,
concentrated all energy, and fought like fiends. They had a battery in
position which belched incessantly, and over the breastworks their
musketry made one unbroken roll, while against Sheridan's prowlers on
their left, by skirmish and sortie, they stuck to their sinking
fortunes so as to win unwilling applause from mouths of wisest
censure.</p>
<p>It was just at the coming up of the infantry that Sheridan's little
band was pushed the hardest. At one time, indeed, they seemed about to
undergo extermination; not that they wavered, but that they were so
vastly overpowered. It will remain to the latest time a matter of
marvel that so paltry a cavalry force could press back 16,000
infantry; but when the infantry blew like a great barn-door--the
simile best applicable--upon the enemy's left, the victory that was to
come had passed the region of strategy and resolved to an affair of
personal courage. We had met the enemy; were they to be ours? To
expedite this consummation, every officer fought as if he were the
forlorn hope. Mounted on his black pony (the same which he rode at
Winchester), Sheridan galloped everywhere, his flushed face all the
redder, and his plethoric but nervous figure all the more
ubiquitous. He galloped once straight down the rebel front, with but a
handful of his Staff. A dozen bullets whistled for him together; one
grazed his arm at which a faithful orderly rode; the black pony leaped
high, in fright; and Sheridan was untouched, but the orderly lay dead
in the field, and the saddle dashed away empty. The fight, as we
closed upon the rebels, was singularly free from great losses on our
side, though desperate as any contest ever fought on the
continent. One prolonged roar of rifle shook the afternoon; we carried
no artillery; and the rebel battery, until its capture, raked us like
an irrepressible demon, and at every foot of the intrenchments a true
man fought, in front and behind. The birds of the forest fled afar;
the smoke ascended to heaven; locked in such mad frenzy, none saw the
sequel of the closing day. Now Richmond rocked in her high towers to
watch the impending issue, but soon the day began to look grey, and a
pale moon came tremorously out to watch the meeting
squadrons. Imagine along a line of a full mile thirty thousand men
struggling for life and prestige; the woods gathering about them--but
yesterday the home of hermit hawks and chipmunks--now ablaze with
bursting shells, and showing in the dusk the curl of flames in the
tangled grass, and, rising up the boles of the pine trees, the
scaling, scorching tongues. Seven hours this terrible spectacle had
been enacted, but the finale of it had almost come.</p>
<p>It was by all accounts, in this hour of victory when the modest and
brave General Wintrop, of the first brigade, Ayre's division, was
mortally wounded. He was riding along the breastworks, and in the act,
as I am assured, of saving a friend's life, was shot through the left
lung. He fell at once, and his men, who loved him, gathered round and
took him tenderly to the rear, where he died before the stretcher on
which he lay could be deposited beside the meeting-house door.</p>
<p>At seven o'clock the rebels came to the conclusion that they were
outflanked and whipped. They had been so busily engaged that they were
a long time finding out how desperate were their circumstances; but
now, wearied with persistent assaults in front, they fell back to the
left, only to see four close lines of battle waiting to drive them
across the field, decimated. At the right, the horsemen charged them
in their vain attempt to fight "out," and in the rear straggling foot
and cavalry began also to assemble; slant fire, cross fire, and direct
fire, by file and volley, rolled in perpetually, cutting down their
bravest officers and strewing the fields with bleeding men; groans
resounded in the intervals of exploding powder, and, to add to their
terror and despair, their own artillery, captured from them, threw
into their own ranks, from its old position, ungrateful grape and
cannister, enfilading their breastworks, whizzing and plunging by air
line and ricochet, and at last bodies of cavalry fairly mounted their
intrenchments and charged down the parapet, slashing and trampling
them, and producing inextricable confusion. They had no commanders--at
least no orders--and looked in vain for some guiding hand to lead them
out of a toil into which they had fallen so bravely and so blindly. A
few more volleys, a new and irresistible charge, a shrill and warning
command to die or surrender and, with a sullen and fearful impulse,
5000 muskets are flung upon the ground, and 5000 hot, exhausted, and
impotent men are Sheridan's prisoners of war. Thus ended the splendid
victory of Five Forks. General Longstreet, it is thought,
commanded.</p></q>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Battle Before
Petersburg.</hi></p>
<p>On learning of this success on the extreme left, Grant determined
on a general assault along the whole line for next day. The 9th Corps
held the ground from the extreme right of the whole Federal line as
far as to the Weldon Railroad, opposite the middle of Petersburg. The
6th Corps, which appears to have been recalled from the left, was
opposite the remaining part of the Petersburg works; next, it would
seem, came the 24th, the 2nd, and the 5th, the whole forming a line of
fully twenty miles in length. The assault took place at all points at
four o'clock in the morning of Sunday, the 2nd of April. It was
received with a terrific fire of artillery from the forts, and with
the most gallant resistance on the part of their garrisons. But the
Federal rush was irresistible. The 9th Corps on the right, and the 6th
on the left, broke through the lines opposite them, and swept down to
each flank, capturing in succession the forts by which the line was
strengthened. Sheridan, on his part, had done his work with equal
efficiency. From the point on the Southside Railway, which the night
before he had seized, he immediately commenced his march eastward,
closing in upon Petersburg. So ended the day. Its results were 12,000
prisoners and fifty guns taken, and the Federals established in
overwhelming force within reach of the last line of defences of the
city. But in the night Lee anticipated capture, and evacuated both
Richmond and Petersburg.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Occupation Of Petersburg And
Richmond By The Federals.</hi></p>
<p>On the following day, the 3rd of April, the two towns were entered
by the victors, amid the shouts of the secret sympathisers, so long
repressed, and of the negroes, frantic with joy, who had not yet been
permitted the privilege of fighting their deliverers.</p>
<p rend="right">Wednesday, April 5, 10.20 p.m.</p>
<p>The following details respecting the evacuation of Richmond and its
occupation by the Union forces were telegraphed to the War Department,
Washington, from that city:--</p>
<q><p>General Wietzel learnt, at three o'clock in the morning of
Monday, that Richmond was being evacuated, and at daylight moved
forward, first taking care to give his men breakfast in the
expectation that they might have to fight. He met no opposition, and,
on entering the city, was greeted with hearty welcome from the mass of
the people. The Mayor went out to meet him and to surrender the city,
but missed him on the road. General Weitzel finds much suffering and
poverty among the population. The rich as well as the poor are
destitute of food. He is about to issue supplies to all who take the
oath. The inhabitants number about 20,000, half of them of African
descent. Jefferson Davis left at seven p.m. by the Danville
Railroad. All the members of Congress escaped. Hunter has gone
home. Judge Campbell remains here. General Weitzel took here 1000
prisoners besides the wounded. These number 5000, in nine
hospitals. He captured cannon to the number of at least 500
pieces. Five thousand muskets have been found in one lot. Thirty
locomotives and 300 cars are found here. The Petersburg Railroad
bridge is totally destroyed; that of the Danville-road partially, so
that connection with Petersburg can easily be made. All the rebel
vessels are destroyed except an unfinished ram, which has her
machinery in her perfect. The Tredegar Works are unharmed and the
machinery was taken to-day, under General Weitzel's orders. Libby
Prison and Castle Thunder have also escaped the fire, and are filled
with rebel prisoners of war. Most of the editors have fled, especially
John Mitchell. The <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> appears as a Union
paper, with the name of the former proprietor at the head. General
Weitzel describes the reception of President Lincoln as enthusiastic
in the extreme.</p></q>
<p>In St. Paul's Church, near the War Department building, President
Davis was (according to one account) sitting at the time General Lee's
telegram announcing the turning of the Confederate right on the White
Oak-road was received. The clergyman had nearly finished his sermon
when an orderly entered the church, passed straight to the President's
pew, and handed to him the fatal despatch. Mr. Davis immediately
proceeded to the War department, thence to the Capitol, and thence to
the Richmond and Danville Railroad d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t, where he made
the necessary preparations for the conveyance of his family to a place
of safety. He remained in the city until near nightfall, when he left
in the 5.30 train.</p>
<p>A letter from Richmond published in the <hi rend="italic">New York
Times</hi> gives the following account of President Lincoln's visit to
the late Confederate capital:--</p>
<q><p rend="right">Head-quarters, Army of the James, Richmond, April
4.</p>
<p>The most interesting fact to be recorded to-day is the visit of the
President to Richmond. Mr. Lincoln, accompanied by his young son and
Admiral Porter, arrived at the Rocketts at two p.m. in the Malvern,
and proceeded at once to the mansion of ex-president Davis, now the
head-quarters of Major-General Weitzel. The arrival of the President
soon got noised abroad, and the coloured population turned out in
great force, and for a time blockaded the quarters of the President,
cheering vociferously. It was to be expected that a population that
three days since were in slavery should evince a strong desire to look
upon the man whose edict had struck for ever the manacles from their
limbs. A considerable number of the white population cheered the
President heartily, and but for the order of the Provost Marshal,
issued yesterday, ordering them to remain within their homes quietly
for a few days, without doubt there would have been a large addition
to the numbers present. After a short interval the President held a
lev&#x00E9;e--General Devins introducing all the officers present. The
President shook hands with each and received the hearty
congratulations of all. The presidential party, attended by Generals
Weitzel, Devins, Shepley, and a brilliant staff of officers, then made
a tour round the city, drove rapidly round the capital, stopping for a
few moments to admire Crawford's magnificent statue of Washington in
the grounds of the Capitol, and returned to General Weitzel's
head-quarters at 5.30. The President and party left Richmond at 6.30
p.m. Admiral Farragut arrived here this morning on a flying visit and
returned to City Point this evening down the James. It is very
satisfactory to be able to state that the torpedoes have been removed
and that six of our gunboats are at the present time lying off the
"Rocketts." The destruction of property by the fire yesterday is
enormous, and must amount to tens of millions of dollars. The dense
volumes of smoke and the intense heat rendered it impossible to form
an adequate idea of the extent of the property destroyed
yesterday. The entire business portion of the city is a heap of
smouldering ruins, and nothing but the absence of wind saved the
entire city from destruction. There is but one feeling of unmitigated
disgust expressed by the residents at this barbarous outrage. It is
positively asserted that General Breckinridge gave the order that the
tobacco and the Government workshops should be set fire to, and the
close proximity of other, valuable property rendered its escape from
destruction almost impossible. The greater portion of the tobacco
destroyed is said to have belonged to France and England. A regular
mail communication between this and City Point will be established
to-morrow, under the superintendence of Lieutenant Parker, who has
been stationed at City Point for some time in the same
capacity. Lieutenant Parker has taken possession of the old Post
Office here, which is well adapted for the purpose. The publication of
the <hi rend="italic">Whig</hi> newspaper is resumed, under the
management of one of its proprietors, who has always been opposed to
secession. I inclose the first copy issued of the reformed journal,
which states the circumstances under which its publication is
permitted to be resumed. It is gratifying to state that the city is
perfectly tranquil, and that the general behaviour of our troops is
all that could be desired and has elicited the admiration of the
citizens generally.</p></q>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Pursuit Of Lee's
Forces.</hi></p>
<p>The pursuit of Lee began as soon as his flight from Wilson's
station, on the 4th inst., was known. General Grant telegraphed to the
Secretary of War:--</p>
<q><p>The army is pushing forward in the hope of overtaking and
dispersing the remainder of Lee's army. Sheridan, with his cavalry and
the 5th Corps, is between this and the Appomattox; General Meade, with
the 2nd and 5th, following. General Ord is following the line of the
Southside Railroad. All of the enemy that retain anything like
organization have gone north of the Appomattox, and are apparently
heading for Lynchburg. Their losses have been very heavy. Houses
through the country are nearly all used as hospitals for wounded
men. In every direction, I hear of rebel soldiers pushing for
home--some in large, some in small squads, and generally without
arms. The cavalry have pursued so closely that the enemy have been
forced to destroy probably the greater part of their transportation,
caissons, and munitions of war. The number of prisoners captured
yesterday will exceed 2800. From the 28th of March to the present time
our loss in killed, wounded, and captured will not probably reach
7000, of whom from 1000 to 2000 were captured, and many but slightly
wounded. I shall continue the pursuit as long as there appears to be
any use in it.</p></q>
<p>It will be observed that Lee's precise course was not known. But
it was at least certain that his only route lay westward, and General
Grant lost not an hour in directing the pursuit. It seems to have been
conducted in three columns. One, consisting of the cavalry, with
(perhaps) the 5th Army Corps, under the command of Sheridan, was in
advance and struck the Danville Railway leading from Richmond to
Burksville Junction, near Amelia Courthouse, about forty miles from
Richmond and twelve from Burksville. General Meade followed on a line
a little to the south, commanding the 2nd and 6th Corps. Grant himself
accompanied the left wing, consisting of the 24th and part of the 25th
Corps, under General Ord, on the direct Burksville road, parallel with
the Southside Railway, and which passes through Nottaway Courthouse,
about ten miles south-east of Burksville. But it was not till Tuesday,
the 4th, when these positions were reached, that any distinct
information was obtained of the whereabouts of what remained of the
routed army. On the evening of that day Sheridan sent word to Meade
that if he could get his column up in time he might capture or
disperse Lee's army, then resting at Amelia Courthouse. On Wednesday,
the 5th, Sheridan was at Jeffersville, half way between Amelia
Courthouse and Burkesville, thus cutting Lee off from the junction and
preventing his adopting the route to Danville; and the Federal
General, pushing a brigade still further to the left, captured five
guns, 200 waggons, and a number of prisoners. The 2nd Corps joined him
in the forenoon, and the 6th in the afternoon; and Grant himself,
leaving Ord's division, which proceeded to and captured Burkesville
the same night, moved across the country, at the earnest request of
his cavalry lieutenant, to be present with the advance. On Thursday,
the 6th, Meade received intelligence that Lee was pointing in the
direction of Farmville, a point on the Lynchburg Railway, about eight
miles west of Burkesville. The Federal troops were at this time
proceeding in a northerly direction from Burkesville, but their route
was at once changed to the north-west; the 6th Corps, which had been
on the right, meantime moving along the rear to the left, to form the
extreme left of the line; the 2nd forming the centre, and the 5th the
right. The cavalry were on the continuation of the left flank. The 2nd
Corps soon became engaged with the enemy, and drove him across
Sailor's Creek, a stream which falls into the Appomattox river about
eight miles north of Burkesville. The 6th Corps, with Sheridan's
cavalry, came up about four p.m., and instantly charged. The result
was decisive, and six Confederate Generals were captured--Ewall,
Kershaw, Button, Corse, Debare, and Curtis Lee--and several thousand
prisoners, fourteen guns, and many caissons fell into the hands of the
victors. For two miles the road was strewn with tents, baggage,
cooking utensils, and ammunition. Several times the enemy appears to
have rallied, and to have attempted a stand behind intrenchments or
natural obstacles; but he was successively driven from them, and only
nightfall seems to have prevented his utter dispersion or
surrender. At this point the narrative for the present stops.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Miscellaneous.</hi></p>
<p>There had been extraordinary rejoicings throughout the North; and
speeches had been made by several members of the Government. In his
speech, Secretary Seward said that, if the people approved, the policy
of the United States would be non-interference in the domestic affairs
of other nations, and that, if England were just towards the United
States, Canada would be left undisturbed.</p>
<p>A serious accident happened to Mr. Seward, in Washington, on the
5th inst. The horses of his carriage in which he was driving with his
family took fright and became unmanageable. Mr. Seward jumped from the
vehicle and fell heavily, on his side, fracturing his right jaw and
the right arm above the elbow. The ladies in the carriage sat still
and escaped unhurt. Mr. Seward's present condition is represented as
favourable.</p>
<p>There has been fighting at Mobile, with varying success. The
intelligence is, however, to the 30th ult., and probably the affair is
over by this time. Both land and sea forces were engaged in the
reduction of the place.</p>
<p>Sherman was still resting at Goldsboro' on the 4th, but was
expected to move against Raleigh and into Virginia.</p>
<p>Two new military movements are reported of a subordinate character,
but which cannot fail to harass the Confederacy, should it survive the
blows already received. One, under the direction of General Wilson, is
aimed at the heart of Alabama, and then to strike at Mobile; the
other, commanded by General Hancock, is directed up the Shenandoah
Valley, for an attack on Lynchburg.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> asserts that President Lincoln
has opened negotiations with Judge Campbell for a settlement with the
South, and that President Davis requested the latter to remain in
Richmond for that purpose.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Bruce, the successor at Washington of Lord Lyons, has
arrived out.</p>
<p>The Federal negro recruiting commission has been removed from
Washington to Richmond in order to organise the negro recruiting in
Virginia.</p>
<p>The Federal transport General Lyon, with nearly 600 troops and
hands on board, has been destroyed by fire on her passage from
Wilmington to Fort Monroe, when over 500 persons perished, including
the captain, who, crazed with fear, was one of the first to desert the
ship in a boat, which was immediately swamped.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>The Canadian Government seems determined to enforce their
neutrality obligations, despite the action of the Montreal Court. The
question of the extradition of the St. Albans raiders will be raised
before the entire bench of Judges. Montreal despatches state that the
raiders had been removed to Toronto, and were expected to be brought
before the Judges there on the 10th inst. Their removal caused much
excitement at Montreal, and it was deemed expedient to escort them to
the railway station by a strong detachment of troops, lest any attempt
should be made to rescue them. The Federal Government has, it is said,
withdrawn its demand for the extradition of the prisoners, in
consequence of the action of the Canadian Executive.</p></div2>

of the Confederate Alabama, was last week erected in the parish
church, Easton, Wilts. It maybe remembered that this gallant man
refused to imperil the safety of the wounded when the Alabama was
sinking by taking a seat in the boat with them, and went down with the
ship amid the balls of the Federal Kearsarge. The monument consists of
a handsome black marble slab of pyramidal form, upon which is placed a

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Murder Of President Lincoln And
Attempt On The Life<lb/>Of Mr. Seward.</hi></p>
<p>The war news, important as it is, containing notice of the
surrender of General Lee, pales before the painful interest of the
intelligence brought by the Nova Scotia on Wednesday. President
Lincoln has been shot dead in a theatre at Washington, and Mr. Seward
stabbed, it is feared mortally, while lying on a sick bed. The
murderer of Mr. Lincoln--Wilkes Booth, the brother of the well-known
actor Edwin Booth, and himself an actor--has been arrested; but his
accomplice, who made the attack on Mr. Seward, has for the time
escaped. The whole of New York is draped in black, and there is
general mourning throughout the country.</p>
<p>The following official telegram from Mr. Secretary Stanton has been
received by the United States Legation in London:--</p>
<p>Sir,--It has become my distressing duty to announce to you that
last night (the 14th inst.) his Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President
of the United States, was assassinated, about the hour of half-past
ten o'clock, in his private box at Ford's Theatre, in the city
(Washington.) The President, about eight o'clock, accompanied
Mrs. Lincoln to the theatre. Another lady and gentleman were with them
in the box. About half-past ten, during a pause in the performance,
the assassin entered the box, the door of which was unguarded, hastily
approached the President from behind, and discharged a pistol at his
head. The bullet entered the back of his head, and penetrated nearly
through. The assassin then leaped from the box upon the stage,
brandishing a large knife or dagger, and exclaiming, "Sic semper
tyrannis," and escaped in the rear of the theatre. Immediately upon
the discharge the President fell to the floor insensible, and
continued in that state until twenty minutes past seven o'clock this
morning, when he breathed his last.</p>
<p>About the same time the murder was being committed at the theatre,
another assassin presented himself at the door of Mr. Seward's
residence, gained admission by representing he had a prescription from
Mr. Seward's physician which he was directed to see administered, and
hurried up to the third story chamber, where Mr. Seward was lying. He
here discovered Mr. Frederick Seward, struck him over the head,
inflicting several wounds, and fracturing the skull in two places,
inflicting, it is feared, mortal wounds. He then rushed into the room
where Mr. Seward was in bed, attended by a young daughter and a male
nurse. The male attendant was stabbed through the lungs, and it is
believed will die. The assassin then struck Mr. Seward with a knife or
dagger twice in the throat and twice in the face, inflicting terrible
wounds. By this time Major Seward, eldest son of the Secretary, and
another attendant reached the room, and rushed to the rescue of the
Secretary; they were also wounded in the conflict, and the assassin
escaped. No artery or important blood vessel was severed by any of the
wounds inflicted upon him, but he was for a long time insensible from
the loss of blood. Some hope of his recovery is entertained.</p>
<p>Immediately upon the death of the President notice was given to
Vice-President Johnson, who happened to be in the city, and upon whom
the office of President now devolves. He will take the office and
assume the functions of President to-day.</p>
<p>The murderer of the President has been discovered and evidence
obtained that these horrible crimes were committed in execution of a
conspiracy deliberately planned and set on foot by rebels under
pretence of avenging the South and aiding the rebel cause; but it is
hoped that the immediate perpetrators will be caught.</p>
<p>The feeling occasioned by these atrocious crimes is so great,
sudden, and overwhelming, that I cannot at present do more than
communicate them to you.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 14th inst.) the President called a Cabinet
meeting, at which General Grant was present. He was more cheerful and
happy than I had ever seen him, rejoiced at the near prospect of firm
and durable peace at home and abroad, manifested in a marked degree
the kindness and humanity of his disposition and the tender and
forgiving spirit that so eminently distinguished him. Public notice
had been given that he and General Grant would be present at the
theatre, and the opportunity of adding the Lieutenant-General to the
number of victims to be murdered was, no doubt, seized for the fitting
occasion of executing the plans that appear to have been in
preparation for some weeks; but General Grant was compelled to be
absent, and thus escaped the designs upon him.</p>
<p>It is needless for me to say anything in regard of the influence
which this atrocious murder of the President may exercise upon the
affairs of this country; but I will only add that, horrible as are the
atrocities that have been resorted to by the enemies of the country,
they are not likely in any degree to impair the public spirit or
postpone the complete final overthrow of the rebellion. In profound
grief for the events which it has become my duty to communicate to
you, I have the honour to be, very respectfully, your obedient
servant,</p>
<p rend="right"><hi rend="smallcaps">Edwin M. Stanton.</hi></p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements of the Constitution, Mr. Andrew
Johnson, the Vice-President, was, on Saturday, sworn in as
President. He said:--"The duties are at present mine--I shall perform
them; the consequences are with God. Gentlemen, I shall lean upon you;
I feel I shall need your support. I am deeply impressed with the
solemnity of the occasion and the responsibility of the duties of the
office I am assuming." Mr. Johnson appeared remarkably well, and his
manner created a favourable impression. The new President has
announced that he will make no changes in the Cabinet.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter has been appointed acting Secretary of State during
Mr. Seward's illness.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">War News.--Surrender Of General
Lee.</hi></p>
<p>The taking of Petersburg and Richmond was quickly followed by the
surrender of General Lee. On the 9th inst. he yielded up his whole
force (estimated at 25,000 men), to General Grant. The two Generals
had been in communication from the 7th as to the terms. Grant pointed
out that nothing but surrender was left. Lee, while not agreeing with
this, thought it best to stop further effusion of blood, and asked for
terms. The terms granted were generous. All officers and men were to
go free, on parole not to take arms again until duly exchanged. The
officers were to keep their side-arms and luggage;<pb n="391"/> but
all public property and munitions of war were to be handed over to the
Federal authorities, Lee at once accepted the terms, and his army is
disbanded.</p>
<p>The joy in the North was, naturally enough very great. The thanks
of the Government were telegraphed to General Grant, and salutes of
guns were fired.</p>
<p>The Northern newspapers assert that Lee's troops had, for the most
part, deserted him before his surrender. He will, it is said, do all
in his power to promote peace.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson Davis may, perhaps, be of the same mind now; but on
the 6th of April he issued a proclamation from Danville declaring that
the war would be continued. To all appearance, he will have little
support in such a course.</p>
<p>The Federal armies are closing in on Johnston's force, which is the
only Confederate army east of the Mississippi. Johnston had evacuated
Raleigh, and gone, it was said, to Greensborough. It is not likely,
however, that he would be able to hold out there or anywhere else. The
report of Federal successes in Alabama is confirmed, and the siege of
Mobile is rapidly progressing. Lynchburg, so long the objective point
of Federal armies, has surrendered to a scouting party.</p>
<p>President Lincoln, in a speech which he made at Washington, said
that recent successes gave hopes of a righteous and speedy
peace. Reconstruction would be fraught with great difficulties, which
would be increased by any differences of opinion among loyal
people. It was "immaterial whether the rebellious States were
considered in or out of the Union;" and "all should join in the acts
necessary to restore proper practical relations between the rebellious
States and the Union." He added that the "adoption of an exclusive and
inflexible plan for all the States would become one of
entanglement."</p>
<p>The general tone of the Northern press is very conciliatory. The
<hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, however, recommends "the
extreme sentence of the law" against Jefferson Davis. The <hi
rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, on the contrary, advises that the utmost
moderation should be exercised towards the Southern leaders.</p>
<p>Several members of the Virginia Legislature, with the assent of the
Federal authorities, who promised safe-conducts to the Governor and
members of the State legislature, had issued a summons for an
extraordinary session to learn and consider the terms upon which
Virginia may be received back into the Union.</p>
<p>President Lincoln had issued a proclamation closing all the
southern ports, with a few exceptions; and another threatening
retaliation on the vessels of war of foreign nations if the
restrictions on American war-ships consequent on the recognition of
the Southern Confederacy as belligerents are not withdrawn.</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton, after consultation with Grant, has decided to
stop all draughting and recruiting; to curtail all purchases of arms,
ammunition, and supplies; to reduce the expenses of the military
establishments and the number of general and staff officers to the
actual necessities of the situation; and to remove all military
restrictions.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> present a View of the new fort lately
erected at the entrance of the Bay of New York, near Sandy Hook. It is
built with all the recent improvements, and is capable of mounting a
very large number of guns. It completely commands the entrance, and
would deal destruction to any vessels attempting to pass for warlike
purposes. There is scarcely, perhaps, any city in the world better
fortified than New York, for, independently of the fortifications, the
navigation is most difficult for ships of large draught of water, so
that it is doubly secured against invaders. Our Engraving is from a

Saturday, April</hi> 29, 1865.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> twice-chosen Chief Magistrate of the
United States of America has died by the hand of an assassin. From
castle and from cottage, from the halls of the Legislature, from the
mart of commerce, from the hearthstones of English homes has gone
forth one shout of execration of the deed, and the first ship from our
shores goes forth bearing every form of our condolence with the
American nation and with those dearest to him who has fallen. It is no
idle phrase to say that the news of Wednesday sent a shudder to the
great heart of our people. That news came at a moment when we were
awaiting tidings of amnesty, peace, and conciliation. The supreme
efforts of the Confederacy had been made, and the tidings of the fall
of Richmond and Petersburg had been followed rapidly by the
information that the gallant Lee had laid down his arms and was using
his best endeavours to terminate a struggle that had become
hopeless. We knew that the President had resolved upon a policy of
mercy, and we believed that he was encouraged to it by the re-awakened
good feeling of the victorious party. At this instant, when the
thoughts of all anon were upon the restoration of peace and the
healing of the rankling wounds of four terrible years, came the fatal
tidings that the man in whose honest hands the good work lay had been
basely murdered by a mountebank. While we write, the excitement of the
news is strong upon our thousands; and, as the lion lays his head to
the ground when he would have the thunder of his voice roll the
furthest, the indignant cry grows deeper and deeper as the utterance
comes from the masses of the people. Their leaders have spoken for
them, nobly and well; but they will also speak for themselves; and if
America ever doubted the brotherly heart of England, the doubt will be
done away for ever by the messages now hastening across the
Atlantic.</p>
<p>It is not now the time to record that Abraham Lincoln, who had to
make his difficult way to the confidence of a large portion of his own
countrymen, had also received justice from all save an angry section
of the English people. The proof that he had done so may be seen in
the mode in which his latest acts and speeches had been received
here. We fully recognised the honesty, courage, and perseverance of
the chosen of the American people; and there was something in his calm
self-possession and quaint but not unkindly humour which has endeared
him to the large mass among us. We, no more than our brethren in the
States, all consent to be represented by sectional organs, and the
real journals of England, speaking for her people, have always paid
becoming tribute to the character of Mr. Lincoln. If we mention this
at such a moment, it is to prevent the possibility of our present
assurances of sympathy being assigned to a temporary feeling. Let the
publications of the ten days previous to the arrival of the melancholy
tidings be our witness in this matter.</p>
<p>While we have ample details of the appalling crime and of the
kindred atrocity which has but too probably given Mr. Lincoln a
companion in death, in the person of his ablest adviser, we have no
information as to the manifest conspiracy and the supposed
accomplices. That the fierce anger of the American people will hunt
out all evidence of the guilt, and will deal the swiftest doom, is
certain. <hi rend="italic">Omnis furiis surrexit Etruria
justis</hi>. The brutality which made its way, with a lie in its
mouth, to the presence of an unsuspecting man, seated beside his wife
and engaged in harmless relaxation from political toil, and, without
warning or challenge, basely slew him, is worthily paralleled by that
which sought a sick man in his bed, mutilated, in one case nearly to
the death, the family around him, and stabbed him amid the screams of
his little child. It is not impossible that the first mail may tell us
that the assassins have already been dealt with. For the honour of
human nature we will hope that they have had no accomplices, or, at
least, none of higher social position than themselves. But it were
rash to say what madness, generated by recent events, may not have
caused. Of one thing we take leave to be certain--namely, that were
the two wretches delivered over to any dozen of Confederate gentlemen,
the fate of the miscreants might, perhaps, be sterner, but would
certainly not be slower, than that which may have already been theirs
in Washington.</p>
<p>At this time it is but for us to join, with all our heart, in the
expression of indignation and sympathy which has gone forth, and to
add our earnest prayer that the foul deeds which have been done will
have no hindering influence; that it may please Providence, who had
seemed to have willed that events should turn the hearts of the
Americans towards peace, will permit the good work to be accomplished;
and that the last sacrifice of the expiring war may be the strong,
brave, good man who has died for his country in her hour of returning
tranquillity.</p></div2>

<p>It is impossible to speak with exaggeration of the intense grief
and indignation with which the news of the assassination of
Mr. Lincoln was received in England. In London the feeling was
profound. Upwards of sixty members of Parliament signed an address of
condolence, which was presented to Mr. Adams, the United States
representative at our Court; and on Monday next, as will be seen by
reference to our Parliamentary columns, both Houses of Parliament will
formally express their sorrow and indignation at the crime. On Monday
next a meeting of Americans in London will be held at St. James's
Hall--Mr. Adams in the chair. In Liverpool the expressions of grief
and indignation were general, and a requisition was got up to the
Mayor to call a meeting to give public utterance to the general
sentiments. In Norwich, too, and, indeed, in almost every town,
similar feeling was shown. In Manchester steps have been taken for
calling a public meeting.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> have been favoured by Commander
Urmston, of H.M.S. Styx, now stationed in Hampton Roads, off Fortress
Monroe, with the sketch we have engraved, showing the Federal ironclad
Monadnock, one of the best of the Monitor class of vessels, as she
appeared when towing the Mohican gun-boat, which had broken down in a
gale off Cape Hatteras, on the coast of North Carolina. The Monadnock,
which is named after a picturesque mountain in New England, took a
leading part in the bombardment of Fort Fisher, and was specially
commended by Admiral David Porter for her services on that
occasion. After the fall of Wilmington, the Monadnock was ordered up
to the James River, Virginia; but a first-class gun-boat, the Mohican,
was sent down to convoy her thither. When they arrived off Cape
Hatteras a gale sprang up, and the Mohican broke down; but the
Monadnock, which had stood the gale much better than was expected, was
able to take the gun-boat in tow, and brought her along, it is said,
at the rate of seven knots an hour, against a head sea, which is such
a feat as no vessel of the kind has ever performed. The Monadnock is a
double-turreted vessel, plated with iron 6 in. thick over the sides
and 10 in. thick over the turrets. Her length is 250 ft.; breadth of
beam, 53 ft.; depth of hold, apparently, 17 ft.; draught of water, 12
ft. Her engines are of about 600-horse power. She carries four guns of
15 in. calibre, throwing 600 lb. shot, with a charge of 60 lb. of
powder, or 480 lb. shot, with 35 lb. of powder. She is esteemed by the
Americans as a model for their future navy.</p></div2>

<p>....And so, in spite of Mosby and his mosstroopers, in spite of
guerrillas and bushwhackers, all New York cries, <hi
rend="italic">Consummatum est!</hi> "It is finished." Panting and
bleeding lies the South, victorious and exultant is the North, and,
let us say it with all respect, not without some grim generosity in
her triumph. Slavery will remain as it is, stabbed to the heart by an
Act of Congress, and to die out slowly; a general amnesty, not even
excluding Jefferson Davis and Mr. Benjamin, will pardon all. Southern
officers will return to their homes with their side-arms, and bound by
their parole; trade will be reassumed, and the energy of the South
turned from making gunpowder and cannon to growing cotton and tobacco;
but, nevertheless, does not everyone feel that the spirit of the South
will be broken for ever? Alas! cry they, might is stronger than right!
Louis Quatorze was right when he said that the God of Battles was
always on the side of him who had the most louis d'ors; and as a
conquered dependency surely that vast Confederation will never
thrive. But America, too, will have her Poland, or, if she like it
better, her Ireland; and it is to be hoped, having that sore in her
side, will talk less about the cruelty of her "stupid old
grandmother." Poor Robert E. Lee! Many a braveheart sides with the
conquered rather than with the conqueror, and is of Cato's opinion
regarding victory. And in Canada we must look out. Americans tell us
that in New York the invasion of the British provinces is looked to as
being as certain as the Presidential election, or the return of the
4th of July. By-the-way, will not Longfellow put in his claims for
being a prophet? It is now two years since he wrote of those who went
down with the Cumberland--</p>
<p rend="center">Ho! brave land! with hearts like these,<lb/>
Thy flag, that is rent in twain,<lb/>

<p>Dark days gloomed for the Republic then; but what he said now bids

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> our Journal of the 2nd of April, last
year, was an Illustration of the race across the British Channel, from
Dover to Calais, between one of the paddle-wheel steamers of that line
and the Atalanta, a new steamer designed by Captain T. E. Symonds,
R.N., on the twin-screw-propeller system, and built by Messrs. J. and
W. Dudgeon, of Cubitt Town, Millwall, for the London, Chatham, and
Dover Railway Company. The Atalanta, which easily got over the
distance in seventy-seven minutes, leaving her competitor far behind,
is the same vessel that was afterwards purchased by the Government of
the Confederate States of America, and named the Tallahassee, from a
place in Florida. Her extraordinary swiftness and her power of rapid
evolution--being able, by reversing one screw, to turn quite round her
own centre in a space little more than her own length--have made her a
moat efficient instrument of maritime warfare. In the autumn of last
year she perpetrated a vast amount of damage to the commerce of the
Northern States--hovering sometimes for weeks near the entrance of the
harbours of New York and Philadelphia, thereby capturing, plundering,
and, burning a great number of American vessels, and even the
pilot-boats of New York, while it was utterly hopeless for any of the
Federal ships of war to attempt to catch her. This career of not
inglorious mischief came to an end some two or three months ago, and
the Tallahassee has been disarmed and disposed of once more to private
owners. She was lately brought to Liverpool, and is now being
refitted, under the name of the Amelia, for ordinary commercial
purposes. We give an Illustration of the present appearance of this
celebrated vessel. She is built of iron, 200 ft. in length, 24 ft. in
breadth, and 14 ft. in depth, with a burden of 500 tons. There are two
engines, independent of each other, and each of 100-horse power,
making from 100 to 120 revolutions a minute. She is an admirable
sea-boat, never rolling, and keeping entirely dry. The superior
advantages of the twin-screw principle, which have been repeatedly
proved by such examples as this, are clearly explained in a scientific
essay read by Captain Symonds at the Institution of Naval Architects
last year, and which has been lately published.</p></div2>

<p>The steamers Edinburgh and Moravian bring news from New York to the
22nd ult.</p>
<p>President Lincoln's funeral was solemnised with great state at
Washington on the 19th ult. A procession of civil, military, and naval
officers, including President Johnson, General Grant, Admiral
Farragut, Butler, and the foreign Ministers followed the
remains. Business was entirely suspended throughout the North. The
body of the President was removed from Washington on the 21st ult.,
and arrived in Baltimore at ten o'clock. From the railway station in
the latter city an immense civic and military procession attended its
conveyance to the Exchange, where it remained until two o'clock in the
afternoon. Thence it was conveyed to Harrisburg, reaching there in the
evening. Next day the body would arrive at Philadelphia, and remain
there till the 24th ult., whence it would be taken on to New York,
arriving on the morning of the 24th. The remains would lie in state
until the hour for the grand procession to move on the following
day. Thence the body would be taken to Albany, Buffalo, Cleveland,
Columbus, Indianapolis, and Chicago, to Springfield, public honours
being paid to the remains in each place.</p>
<p>All civil, military, and naval officers have been ordered to wear
mourning for Mr. Lincoln for six months.</p>
<p>We now learn how deep and universal were the horror and grief
throughout the northern states at the assassination of
Mr. Lincoln. The foreign Ministers have sent a deputation to convey to
Mr. Lincoln's family expressions of their sympathy; the British and
French residents in New York have held a meeting, at which resolutions
expressive of deep sympathy were passed; and the Confederate prisoners
at Point Look Out have passed resolutions of abhorrence at
Mr. Lincoln's assassination, and expressing sympathy for his
family. Of the feelings called forth in this and other countries by
the atrocious deed some mention is made in other parts of this
Journal.</p>
<p> Mr. Seward, by latest accounts, was better, and he sat up for a
short time on the 18th ult. Some bandages and wires around his neck,
for the support of his broken jaw, saved him, it is said, from fatal
wounds. It is even premised that the wounds did him a service; for,
upon the same evening on which the attack was made, the surgical
attendants had decided to lance his cheek, in order to relieve it from
an extraordinary pressure of blood. Mr. Frederick Seward was also
improving. He has regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Booth, it appears, is still at large, but the man supposed to have
been his accomplice, and who made the dastardly attack on Mr. Seward,
has been arrested at Washington. His name is Surratt, and Mr. Seward's
servants are said to have identified him. It is also said that a
resident of Baltimore has confessed to complicity in the design and
been arrested, but there is really no trustworthy intelligence of
either of the villains. A large reward has been offered for their
discovery. The assassin of the President left behind him a hat and a
spur. The hat was picked up in the President's box, and has been
identified as one belonging to the suspected man Booth; the spur had
dropped upon the stage, and that also has been identified as one
procured at a stable where the same man hired a horse in the
evening. A letter of Booth, written several months ago shows that he
was plotting the capture of Mr. Lincoln, but gives no intimation that
he contemplated assassination.</p>
<p>The Diplomatic Corps have visited President Johnson. Baron Gerolt,
Prussian Ambassador, read an address of condolence, and expressed
hopes for the early re-establishment of peace and the maintenance of
friendly relations with foreign Powers.</p>
<p>Sir Frederick Bruce has presented his credentials. He expressed
deep sympathy at Mr. Lincoln's death, and said that her Majesty had
nothing more at heart than to cultivate relations of amity and a good
understanding, so long happily existing between England and
America. In this spirit he was directed to perform his
duties. Mr. Johnson expressed pleasure at her Majesty's friendly
sentiments, and said that the interests of civilisation and humanity
required that England and America should be friends. He always
accepted it as an honourable fact that the Queen was a sincere and
honest well-wisher of the United States.</p>
<p>President Johnson has made several speeches in reply to the
addresses of delegates from different parts of the Union; but he has
afforded no definite indications of his policy, though he has
repeated his declaration that treason is the highest crime, and that
traitors must be punished.</p>
<p>It is alleged that Mr. Johnson's intoxication on the day of his
inauguration as Vice-President was a most exceptional occurrence,
the<pb n="423"/> combined result of natural excitement and two glasses
of spirits taken by medical advice. It is affirmed that Mr. Johnson is
not a dram-drinker, but habitually a sober man in the strictest sense
of the word. We gladly take this view of the case. Still, the fact
must weigh against him that he suffered himself to be "overtaken" (to
use the mildest euphemism at one's command) on such an august
occasion. From the memoir of the new President--given, with a
Portrait, in another part of this Journal--it will be seen with what
energy he raised himself, step by step, from his originally obscure
condition; and it is to be hoped, for the welfare of his country as
well as for his own credit, that his good genius will not desert him
now that he has attained the summit of man's ambition. President
Johnson evidently feels the weight of responsibility cast upon him,
and has borne himself with a dignity and prudence which are
reassuring.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson having vacated the vice-presidency, the office devolves
upon Mr. Lafayette S. Foster, of Connecticut. According to the laws of
the United States, in case of the death of both the President and
Vice-President, the President <hi rend="italic">pro tempore</hi> of
the Senate becomes Chief Magistrate.</p>
<p>The greatest order continues throughout the Northern States.</p>
<p>General Anderson formally replaced the United States flag on Fort
Sumter on Friday, the 14th ult., when the Rev. Ward Beecher and others
delivered patriotic addresses.</p>
<p>General Lee has arrived at Richmond, where he was enthusiastically
received both by the Unionists and Confederates. Lee's farewell order
says that, after four years of arduous service, marked by unsurpassed
courage, the army had been compelled to yield to overwhelming numbers
and resources, and had surrendered to avoid useless sacrifice of
life.</p>
<p>It is reported from Richmond that Mr. Jefferson Davis and his
Cabinet have reached Augusta and established a Government there,
preparatory to flight to the Transmississippi Department.</p>
<p>The surrender of General Johnston, which, under existing
circumstances, could not long be delayed, is announced, but not as yet
upon what appears to be trustworthy authority. Mosby also is said to
have laid down his arms, and Rosser is stated to have made
propositions to the same effect. After a series of hard fights the
Confederates were driven from the outworks of Mobile, and on the 12th
ult. it was found that they had evacuated the place. This was their
last seaport. An expedition from Charleston has destroyed 1000 bales
of cotton, and all the railway bridges between Columbia and Florence,
and has brought in 2500 slaves. 5000 more are waiting to come in.</p>

<p>The murder of President Lincoln has called forth in the British
Provinces the utmost indignation and numerous expressions of deep
sympathy with the Northern States at their bereavement. The Governor
of Nova Scotia, in consequence of the assassination, postponed his
intended visit, and recommended the adjournment of the Legislature as
a mark of sympathy. The day of the solemnisation of President
Lincoln's funeral in Washington (the 19th ult.) was observed in the
principal cities of the provinces by a partial suspension of business
and the closing of the public buildings.</p></div2>

<p>The horror which the murder of Mr. Lincoln has excited in England
is being daily expressed in one form or another. The Queen has written
a letter of sympathy to Mrs. Lincoln; and both Houses of Parliament
have, at the instance of the Government, addressed the Crown, asking
that the sentiments which animate them may be known to the Government
of America. Besides the two large meetings held in St. James's Hall,
of which particulars are given elsewhere, the working classes of
London met, on Thursday, at St. Martin's Hall, and passed addresses of
condolence with Mrs. Lincoln and the American people. Meetings for a
similar purpose have been held in every important town in the
kingdom. The usual spring county meetings in Scotland were, with one
or two exceptions, held on Monday. At nearly all it was resolved to
transmit to the American Minister in London addresses expressive of
the sorrow and indignation with which the commissioners of supply and
justices of the peace had learned the news of the assassination of
President Lincoln, and of their sympathy with the American people
under that calamity.</p></div2>

Treasury<lb/>of the United States.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> Hon. Hugh M'Culloch, who was lately
appointed by President Lincoln to the office of Secretary to the
Treasury, vacated by the retirement of Mr. Fessenden, is a native of
Kennebunk, York County, in the State of Maine. He was educated for the
legal profession, and, in 1838, removed to Fort Wayne, in the State of
Indiana, where he has resided above thirty years, filling at one time
the office of Probate Judge. But he soon left the paths of legal
practice and judicial promotion for the banking business, and became
cashier of the Branch Bank of Indiana at Fort Wayne. He was
subsequently made one of the Board of Control of the State Bank system
of that State and it is asserted by his friends that there was not one
of the measures devised for the security and efficiency of that
system but was inspired or shaped by his sound judgment and financial
sagacity. He early established a reputation as a skilful and most
reliable financier, which each succeeding year enlarged; and on the
incorporation of the State Bank in Indianapolis, with its twenty
branches, in 1856, he was made president under the most encouraging
auspices, and, despite the crash of 1857, gave a character to the
banks of Indiana which made, unmistakably, a favourable impression on
financial circles. When the office of Comptroller of the Currency was
instituted, he was recommended for it with general unanimity, and the
moneyed interests of the country felt that in his hands the conversion
of the State banks into national institutions was entirely
secure. This great financial revolution, by which the national
currency is passing from under a divided, irregular State control to
that of a national system which is to secure a uniform American
currency, has been superintended by Mr. M'Culloch. Already five
hundred of these State creations have assumed the prefix of national
banks, and the change is going on rapidly and healthfully. That much
of this is due to the tact and masterly management of Mr. M'Culloch
those best qualified to judge will readily concede. Mr. M'Culloch had
agreed to take the position of president of the Fourth National Bank
of New York, with its capital of 4,000,000 dols., organised by a
number of the leading men of that city, but they reluctantly released
him on finding that there was a general conviction that the office of
Secretary to the Treasury could be placed in no more efficient
hands.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">SKETCHES IN PARLIAMENT.</p>
<p>....It so happened that the moving of the address to the Crown
expressing the opinion of Parliament with regard to the murder of the
President of the United States was concluded in the Commons before it
commenced in the Lords; so that a very slight increase of activity
enabled any who chose and had the privilege, to bear witness to both
ceremonials. There was this disadvantage, however, that the
proceedings in the Upper House were dimmed and dulled by contrast. In
any case however, and without the drawback of comparison, every
spectator must have been sensible of utter failure. In that large
gilded and many-hued chamber Earl Russell's voice is painfully
inadequate to the area which it ought to fill; and when he appears, as
he does during half his speeches, to most of those who are striving to
listen to him, to be going through an operation akin to that by means
of which intercommuncation is held with the deaf-and-dumb, the effect
is indescribable. This time, what was heard was characteristic of that
cold, hard, unsympathising style out of which he never has been
routed, except in a few cases when his personal ambition has been
involved or his personal vanity wounded. What need was there of a long
dissertation on questions of policy, actual and tentative, and of
half-insinuated political distrust, when the subject was the
denunciation of a great crime? But why dwell on this painful failure
when one has to speak of one still more conspicuous and, moreover,
most surprising? What evil influence came over Lord Derby's spirit at
such a moment, when the springs of his naturally generous heart should
have been overflowing? Was it that an unconscious distaste for his
task lurked in his mind? For unless that were so there can be no
accounting for the bad tone, the mistakes in illustration, the absence
of spontaneity in the right, and its intrusive presence in the wrong,
places, even for the deficiency of eloquence, which he displayed. In
fact, it seemed as if he looked at the act which he was called on to
denounce purely in its political and not in the least in its personal
phase, and was doing violence to his political proclivities in
condemning it. Any way, he never has appeared to less advantage; and
it were as well if the whole proceeding in the Peers' had never
occurred, for all its appropriateness to the occasion.</p>
<p>It is quite certain that if Lord Palmerston had been able to
perform the function of condolence in the Commons, that it would have
been done correctly--with tact and with due, if without pronounced,
effect. As senior Secretary of State, the deputy-leadership was for
the nonce with Sir George Grey; and in a certain sense he was
successful, although in another sense he could hardly have been
considered so. If he was wanting in the dignity, the measured
solemnity, which was fitting to such an exposition of the feelings of
the House and of the nation, he was abundantly earnest, emotional, and
almost impassioned; so that though his speech was here and there
faulty, and as a whole not particularly well constructed or conceived,
he was manifestly real, and what he said came direct from his feeling;
and even in such an assembly as the House of Commons genuineness is
not always unacceptable. In marked contrast to Sir George's address
was that of Mr. Disraeli. In its conception and arrangement, in
delicate touches, in happy illustrations, and in its whole spirit, it
was admirable--indubitably the very best thing of the kind he has ever
produced; but the manner, the voice, the pose, the gesture were all so
artificial, that the mind of the listener was inevitably awakened to
the palpable evidences of elaborate preparation in the speech itself,
which, had it been uttered naturally and simply, would have been an
oratorical triumph of no mean order; but, after all, it seemed to
spring from impulses and feelings so creditable and so sympathetic
that, with as much surprise as pleasure, the universal House applauded
it with cheers the ring of which was of the true kind, and which must
have been peculiarly agreeable to Mr. Disraeli, than whom no one could
better understand their quality....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">HOUSE OF LORDS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Monday.</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Murder Of President
Lincoln.--Address To The Crown.</hi></p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> moved an address to the
Crown expressing the sorrow and indignation with which the House had
heard of the assassination of Mr. Lincoln. He believed that the motion
would receive the entire concurrence of their Lordships. Having stated
that her Majesty had written an autograph letter to Mrs. Lincoln
condoling with her in her bereavement, the noble Earl observed that no
such crime had been committed in modern times as the murder of the
twice-elected President of the great American Republic, who had borne
his honours meekly; had displayed so much integrity, sincerity, and
straightforwardness, and had done so much to alleviate the miseries of
war; and who appeared disposed to follow up the success achieved by
arms by a wise, conciliatory, and generous policy towards the
South. He was sure that there was in this country a universal sympathy
with the United States in their great deprivation, as well as a hope
that the successor of Mr. Lincoln would follow the example of
moderation set him by his predecessor. He trusted that the policy of
neutrality which had been adopted by her Majesty's Government in
reference to the civil war, and the moderation which had characterised
that of the United States towards this country, would continue; and
that this special proceeding of Parliament would have the effect of
convincing the people of America that every class in this country felt
the deepest sympathy with them in the loss they had sustained.</p>
<p>The motion was seconded by the Earl of <hi
rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi>, who said that the House, in expressing
its sorrow and indignation at the atrocious crime by which the United
States had been deprived of its chief magistrate, only followed the
universal sympathy which prevailed from one end of the country to the
other; and such an expression of feeling must prove a complete
refutation of any idea or impression which might lurk in the mind of
the people of the United States that any unfriendly feeling existed
towards them on the part of any section of the people of England. For
the crime which had been committed no palliation could be offered,
and, whatever difference of opinion there might be as to the
respective rights of the North and the South, all must agree that it
could not serve the cause of the South. It was, he thought, impossible
to believe that the Confederate Government could in any way approve an
act which was not only a crime but a blunder. He joined with Earl
Russell in lamenting the loss of a man who had conducted the affairs
of the United States amidst great difficulties with singular
moderation and prudence, and who was bent on trying a system of
conciliation. The death of such a man, and in such a manner, was not
only a subject of deep regret but also a serious misfortune to the
country of which he was the chief, and it was to be hoped that his
successor would see the wisdom of following out that conciliatory line
of policy which there was every reason to believe the late President
was preparing to inaugurate when his valuable life was taken.</p>
<p>After a few words from Lord Stratford de Redcliffe in favour of the
motion, it was unanimously agreed to....</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Monday.</hi></p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">The Murder Of President
Lincoln.--Address To The Crown.</hi></p>
<p>The orders of the day were postponed for the purpose of enabling
the Government to propose an address to the Crown on the assassination
of President Lincoln.</p>
<p>Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">G. Grey</hi>, having expressed his regret
at the unavoidable absence of Lord Palmerston, observed that it was
comparatively unimportant by whom the motion was made, because he felt
confident that the address which he was about to move would meet with
the cordial and unanimous assent of the House. When the news of the
assassination of President Lincoln and of the attempt on the life of
Mr. Secretary Seward reached this country, the first impression on the
mind of every one was that the intelligence could not be true. But
when the fact became fully known a feeling of deep sorrow, horror, and
indignation pervaded the public mind, and the people of the United
Kingdom felt as if some great calamity had befallen
themselves. Whatever might be the conflicting opinions or sympathies
of the public as between North and South, they had completely vanished
in the presence of the great crime which all Europe now deplored. He
was persuaded that this sentiment also animated every man in the
Southern as well as in the Northern States. The American nation now
mourned the loss of their trusted and chosen chief, struck down by the
hand of an assassin at the most eventful period of his country's
history. Just as it was hoped that the civil war was about to be
brought to a close, all eyes were turned towards Mr. Lincoln, in the
expectation that in the hour of victory he would have shown that
forbearance and just consideration which would have added tenfold to
the energy and ability by which he had prosecuted the
war. Unfortunately, the hand of an assassin had deprived him of the
opportunity of displaying his magnanimity; but it was to be hoped that
the good sense and right feeling of those on whom the arduous duty of
conducting public affairs would devolve would lead them to act with
the same wisdom and sagacity which there was reason to believe he
would have exhibited had his life been spared to accomplish the
pacification of his country. Sir George Grey, who was frequently
cheered throughout his speech, concluded as follows:--"Sir, I wish it
were possible for us to convey to the people of the United States an
adequate idea of the depth and universality of the feeling which this
sad event has occasioned in this country. From the highest to the
lowest there has been but one feeling entertained. Her Majesty's
Minister at Washington will, in obedience to the Queen's commands,
convey to the Government of the United States an expression of the
feelings of her Majesty and of her Majesty's Government on this
deplorable event. And her Majesty, with that tender consideration
which she has always evinced for the sorrows and sufferings of others
in whatever rank and station (hear, hear), has with her own hand
written a letter to Mrs. Lincoln (hear, hear), conveying the heartfelt
sympathy of a widow to a widow (hear, hear) suffering from an
overwhelming calamity that has so suddenly come upon her (hear,
hear). From every part of this country, and from every class of the
community, one voice is now raised--a voice of abhorrence at the
crime, and of sympathy and interest in that country which has this
great loss to mourn. The British residents in the United States have
met, as may have been expected, to express their feelings against the
crime committed; and we read that our British North American colonies
are vieing with each other to give expression to the same sentiments
of sympathy. And not only is it from men of that race which is
connected with the inhabitants of the United States by the tie of
origin, language, and blood that a feeling of this kind arises, but I
believe that every country in Europe is giving expression to the same
sentiments and sending them to the Government of the United
States. But I am sure, therefore, I am not wrong in anticipating that
this House, in the name of the people of England, of the people of
Scotland, and of the people of Ireland, will be anxious to record its
expression of the same sentiments and feelings to the Government of
the United States. Of this I am confident, that this House could
never more fully and never more adequately represent the feelings of
the people of this United Kingdom than by agreeing  to the address
which it is now, Sir, my duty to move, expressing to her Majesty our
sorrow and indignation at the assassination of the President of the
United States and praying her Majesty, in conveying her own
sentiments to the Government of that country upon this deplorable
event, that she will express at the same time upon the part of this
House their abhorrence of the crime and their sympathy with the
Government and the people of the United States in the deep affliction
into which they have been plunged." (Loud cheers from all parts of the
house.)</p>
<p> Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Disraeli</hi>: "Sir, there are rare
instances when the sympathy of a nation approaches those tender
feelings that, generally speaking, are supposed to be peculiar to the
individual, and to form the happy privilege of private life, and I
think this is one of them (Hear, hear). Under all circumstances we
should have bewailed the catastrophe at Washington; under all
circumstances we should have shuddered at the means by which it was
accomplished. But in the character of the victim, and in the very
accessories of his almost latest moments, there is something so homely
and so innocent that it takes the subject, as it were, out of the pomp
of history and out of the ceremonial of diplomacy. It touches the
heart of nations, and appeals to the domestic sentiments of mankind
(Hear, hear). Sir, whatever may be the various and varying opinions of
this House and the country generally of the policy of the late
President of the United States, of this, I think, all must be agreed,
that in a trial which, perhaps more than any other, tested the moral
quality of the man he performed his duty with simplicity and strength
(hear, hear). Nor is it possible for the people of England to forget
at this moment that he sprang from the same fatherland, and spoke the
same mother tongue (Hear, hear). When crimes of this character are
perpetrated the public mind is apt to fall into gloom and perplexity,
and that has arisen because it is as ignorant of the causes as it is
of the consequences of such an act, But it is our part, I think, to
reassure them under any unreasoning panic or despondency (Hear,
hear). Assassination has never changed the history of the world. I
will not refer to instances of remote antiquity, although an accident
has made the most memorable example of those times familiar at this
moment to the mind and memory of most gentlemen present. But even the
costly sacrifice of a C&#x00E6;sar did not propitiate the inevitable
destiny of his country. But in more modern times, the people of which
were animated and influenced by the same interests as ourselves, the
violent deaths of two heroic men, Henry IV. of France and the Prince
of Orange, are conspicuous illustrations of this great
truth. Therefore at this moment, while I second the address to the
Crown, and express upon my own part, and I hope on the part of every
member of the house, feelings of unaffected and profound sympathy with
the citizens of the United States at the untimely end of their elected
chief, I would not sanction any sentiment of depression. I would
rather take this opportunity of expressing my fervent hope that from
these awful years of trial the various populations of North America
may come out elevated, chastened, rich in that accumulative wisdom,
and strong in that disciplined energy which a young nation can only
acquire in a protracted and perilous struggle. Then will be open to
them again, not merely the same course of power and prosperity which
they have heretofore pursued, but they will pursue that course of
power and prosperity for the general happiness of mankind (Hear,
hear). It is with these feelings, Sir, that I now second the address
to the Crown." (Loud and general cheering.)</p>

<p rend="center">THE NEW PRESIDENT OF<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps">The
United States.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew Johnson</hi>, who was lately
elected Vice-President of the United States, and who has succeeded to
the presidency upon the death of Mr. Lincoln, was born in Raleigh,
North Carolina, Dec. 29, 1808. When he was four years of age he lost
his father, who died from the effect of exertions to save a friend
from drowning. At the age of ten he was apprenticed to a tailor in his
native city, with whom he served seven years. His mother was unable to
afford him any educational advantages, and he never attended school a
day in his life. While learning his trade, however, he resolved to
make an effort to educate himself. His anxiety to be able to read was
particularly excited by an incident which is worthy of mention. A
gentleman of Raleigh was in the habit of going into the tailor's shop
and reading while the apprentice and journeymen were at work. He was
an excellent reader, and his favourite book was a volume of speeches,
principally of British statesmen. Johnson became interested, and his
first ambition was to equal him as a reader and become familiar with
those speeches. He took up the alphabet without an instructor; but, by
applying to the journeymen with whom he worked, he obtained a little
assistance. Having acquired a knowledge of the letters, he applied for
a loan of the book which he had so often heard read. The owner made
him a present of it and gave him some instruction on the use of
letters in the formation of words. Thus, his first exercises in
spelling were in that book. By perseverance he soon learned to read;
and the hours which he devoted to his education were at night, after
he had finished his daily labour upon the shopboard. He now applied
himself to books from two to three hours every night, after working
from ten to twelve hours at his trade. Having completed his
apprenticeship in the autumn of 1824, he went to Laurens Courthouse,
South Carolina, where he worked as a journeyman for nearly two
years. While there he became engaged to be married, but the match was
broken off by the violent opposition of the girl's mother and friends,
the ground of objection being Mr. Johnson's youth and the want of
pecuniary means. In May, 1826, he returned to Raleigh, where he
procured journey-work, and remained until September. He then set out
to seek his fortune in the West, carrying with him his mother, who was
dependent upon him for support. He stopped at Greenville, Tennessee
and commenced work as a journeyman. He remained there about twelve
months, married, and soon afterwards went still further westward, but,
failing to find a suitable place to settle, he returned to Greenville
and commenced business. Up to this time his education was limited to
reading, as he had never had an opportunity of learning to write or
cipher; but under the instruction of his wife he learned these and
other accomplishments. The only time, however, he could devote to them
was in the dead of the night. The first office which he ever held was
that of alderman of the village, to which he was elected in 1828. He
was re-elected to the same position in 1829, and again in 1830. In
that year he was chosen mayor, which position he held three years. In
1835 he was elected to the Legislature. In the Session of that year he
took decided ground against a scheme of internal improvements, which
he contended would not only prove a failure, but entail upon the State
a burdensome debt. The measure was popular, however, and at the next
election (1837) he was defeated. He became a candidate again in
1839. By this time many of the evils he had predicted were fully
demonstrated, and he was elected by a large majority. In 1840 he
served as presidential elector from the State at large on the
Democratic ticket. He canvassed a large portion of the State, meeting
upon this tour several of the leading Whig orators. In 1841 he was
elected to the State Senate. In 1843 he was elected to Congress,
where, by successive elections, he served until 1853. During this of
period of service he was conspicuous and active in advocating the bill
for refunding the fine imposed upon  General Jackson at New Orleans in
1815, the annexation of Texas, the tariff of 1846, the war measures of
Mr. Polk's Administration, and a homestead bill. In 1853 he was
elected Governor of Tennessee after an exciting canvas. He was
re-elected in 1855, after another active contest. At the expiration of
his second period as Governor, in 1857, he was elected United States
Se<pb n="438"/>nator for a full term, ending March 3, 1863. At the last Presidential election he was made Vice-President, and took the oaths of that office on the 4th of March. We engrave his Portrait, from a photograph supplied by Mr. A. M. Bailey's American agency, Northumberland-court, Charing-cross.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Public</hi> meeting was called upon very
short notice, at St. James's Hall, on Saturday evening, to express
condolence with the people of the United States, and with the widow
and family of the late President Lincoln, upon the shocking event
which took place at Washington on the 14th ult. The hall had been most
appropriately decorated. The galleries were tastefully draped with
black cloth, trimmed with white bandeaux, and relieved with a white
and black mixed cord, in festoons. The upper gallery was similarly
draped, and displayed a group of the American national colours covered
with crape. The whole was completed (by Messrs. Garstin, of
Welbeck-street, gratuitously) in little more than an hour, as the hall
was otherwise engaged up to three o'clock. The hall was well filled in
every part. The chair was taken by Mr. W. Evans, president of the
London Emancipation Society. The meeting was addressed by
Mr. W. E. Forster, M.P.; Mr. Peter Taylor, M.P.; Mr. Leatham, M.P.;
Mr. T. B. Potter, M.P.; Mr. Baxter, M.P.; the Hon. Lyulph Stanley,
Mr. H. Fawcett; Mr. Caird, M.P.; Mr. Grenfell, M.P.; Mr. Crum Ewing,
M.P.; the Rev. Newman Hall, and Mr. Mason Jones, and the proceedings
were of a very earnest and impressive character.</p>
<p>The following were the resolutions adopted:--</p>
<p>"That this meeting desires to give utterance to the feelings of
grief and horror with which it has heard of the assassination of
President Lincoln and the murderous attack upon Mr. Seward, and to
convey to Mrs. Lincoln and to the United States Government and people
an expression of its profound sympathy and heartfelt condolence.</p>
<p>"That this meeting desires also to express the entire confidence
which it feels in the determination and the power of the Government
and the people of the United States to carry out to the full the
policy of which Abraham Lincoln's presidential career was the
embodiment, and to establish free institutions throughout the whole of
the American Republic.</p>
<p>"That copies of the foregoing resolutions be placed in the hands of
the Hon. C. F. Adams, the American Minister, for transmission to his
Excellency the President of the United States, Mrs. Lincoln, and the
Hon. W. H. Seward."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">MEETING OF AMERICANS IN LONDON.</p>
<p>A meeting of Americans in London was held at St. James's Hall, on
Monday evening. The decorations of the hall were the same as those
displayed on Saturday, with the addition of an immortelle which hung
below the American flag. The chair was taken by his Excellency the
Hon. Charles Francis Adams, the Minister of the United States at the
Court of Great Britain; and amongst those present, besides Lord
Houghton; Alderman Salomons, M.P.; Mr. T. B. Potter, M.P., and other
members of the British Parliament, were the following gentlemen from
America or connected with America:--Mr. Cyrus Field, Judge Winter,
Dr. Black, Mr. Fuller; Mr. E. C. Fisher, of the United States Sanitary
Commission; Rev. Crammond Kennedy; Mr. Morse, Consul of the United
States; Mr. Nunn, Deputy Consul of the United States; Mr. B. Howard,
New York, late United States army; Mr. Henry Bergh, late Secretaire de
la Legislation des Etats Unis d'Amerique St. Petersburg; Dr. Coffin,
Mr. Henry Thornton, Mr. John B. Stephenson, Mr. C. M. Lampson,
Dr. Ludlow; Mr. E. G. Tinker and Mr. Ward, New York; Mr. H. Stevens
and Mr. B. F. Stevens, Vermont; Dr. Storrs, Mr. Peach, and Mr. Massey,
New York; Mr. Phillips, Wisconsin; Mr. G. J. Abbott, Consul of the
United States for Sheffield and Bradford; Rev. J. Shaw, Boston;
Mr. J. Holmes Goodenow, United States Consul at Constantinople;
Mr. G. Grant, Mr. Gerard Ralston, Philadelphia, Consul-General of
Liberia; Captain Richardson, San Francisco; Mr. C. Stratton (General
Tom Thumb) and Mrs. Stratton, Mr. J. M'henry, Captain Tomkins, and
Mr. H. Brough.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams, the chairman, in opening the proceedings, remarked that
it was because Abraham Lincoln was a faithful exponent of the
sentiments of a whole people that he was stricken down. The blow that
was aimed at him was meant to fall upon the Northern supporters of the
Union. It was a supposed short way of paralysing the Government which
they had striven so hard to maintain. It was, then, for their cause
that Abraham Lincoln had died. If he was called a tyrant who was
elevated to his high post by the spontaneous voices of a greater
number of men than had ever been given in republic before, it was only
because he was obeying the wishes of those who elected him. Mr. Adams
expressed his confidence in the new President. "He, too," said his
Excellency, "has been susceptible to the influence of the national
opinion. He, too, has gradually been brought to the conviction that
slavery, which he once defended, has been our bane and the cause of
all our woe. And he, too, will follow his predecessor in making the
recognition of the principle of human liberty the chief pathway to
restoration. Maybe that he will colour his policy with a little more
of the sternness gathered from the severity of his own trials. He may
give a greater prominence to the image of Justice than to that of
Mercy in dealing with notorious offenders. But if he do, to whom is
this change to be imputed? Lincoln leaned to mercy, and he was taken
off. Johnson has not promoted himself. The magician who worked this
change is the enemy himself. It would seem almost as if it were the
will of Heaven which has interposed the possibility of this marvellous
retribution."</p>
<p>Mr. Morse, the American Consul in London, spoke of President
Johnson from his personal knowledge. Twenty-one years ago, he said, he
entered the Congress of the United States with Andrew Johnson, who was
then the representative of the State of Tennessee. He was on a
committee with him, and sat three or four times a week with him,
perhaps, for the space of two years, and he said there, that
throughout the whole of that period, and for three or four years
subsequently, during which time his acquaintance with Andrew Johnson
continued, he never heard one word whispered against his fair fame. He
never heard the reproach of intemperance cast upon him. He had seen
him daily, and knew him well, and he knew that to charge him with
habitual intemperance was one of the vilest slanders that could be
brought against him.</p>
<p>Dr. Black moved a resolution expressing confidence that Mr. Johnson
would "faithfully prosecute to final success the wise, the humane, and
statesman-like domestic and foreign policy of the late President
Lincoln." Remarking that Mr. Lincoln, who was so vilified when living,
had, no vilifiers now, Dr. Black said Andrew Johnson was now the man
at whom attacks would be directed; but it would not be many years, he
apprehended, before his vilifiers would also hang down their
heads.</p>
<p>The various resolutions were carried unanimously, and one was added
in recognition of the sympathy extended to the United States by the
people of this country.</p></div2>

<p>....Of the assassination of President Lincoln little can be said
here in our light way. Probably no event could have drawn towards the
North the wavering sympathies of our commercial classes so strongly as
this. The Queen, sympathising in her widowhood, has written touchingly
and gracefully to Mrs. Lincoln. It is said that Booth--who assisted,
by-the-way, in hanging that proto-martyr of this slave war, John
Brown--was madly fond of acting such characters as Brutus, Pierre, or
Jaffier. No doubt his overwrought mind had long been familiar with the
idea he so fatally put in action. As anything about Herostratus--that
ambitious youth who "fired th' Ephesian dome," and who, we are told,
"outlives in fame the pious fool that rear'd it"--would have been
interesting on the morrow of the event, it may not be out of place
here to remark that the last time the three brothers Booth played in
New York they acted in "Julius Caesar," Marc Antony, Brutus, and
Cassius being personified by Junius Brutus, Edwin, and the assassin
John Wilkes Booth, the last, as will be here seen, playing, not Marcus
Brutus, but the lean, hungry, and envious Cassius....</p></div2>

successively introduced to the scenery of winter and summer, of the

and to the great popular gatherings where the anti-slavery sentiment
was educated. Garrison and Whittier are among Mr. Conway's portraits,
and some specimens are given of the really magical oratory of Wendell
Phillips. There is also a fine gloomy picture of the shame and horror
created at Boston by the enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Law. A
remarkable utterance of an old Governor of Virginia is mentioned. "I
thank God," he wrote to Charles II., "there are no free schools nor
printing, and I hope we shall not have any these hundred years, for
learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the

<p>Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of America during
the most momentous period of rule since that of his great predecessor
George Washington, was the grandson of Abraham Lincoln, killed by
Indians in 1784, and was the son of Thomas Lincoln, of Virginia, by
his wife, Nancy Hanks. He was born, Feb. 12, 1809, in Harden County,
Kentucky. His father, Thomas Lincoln, when the young Abraham was about
eight years of age, removed with his family to Spencer County,
Indiana. There for the next twelve years Abraham Lincoln worked with
his father in the ordinary pursuits of a settler, living in the log
hut which the neighbours assisted them to build when they first came
to the neighbourhood. He had not, however, during all these years the
guiding hand of his mother, for she died shortly after they took up
their residence in Indiana. In course of time, a Mr. Crawford came to
settle in the neighbourhood and opened a school in his own cabin, and
Abraham Lincoln was his pupil. Abraham was a youth of manifold
qualifications; he had perseverance, a desire for knowledge,
truthfulness, and earnestness. The books which he loved to peruse at
this period were Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," "&#x00C6;sop's
Fables," a life of Henry Clay, afterwards Lincoln's model of a
statesman; and Weem's "Life of Washington." When he was nineteen he
made a trip to New Orleans in a flat-boat with the son of one of his
neighbours, with a cargo for the New Orleans market. In addition to a
long voyage down the River Ohio, which bounds Indiana on the south,
the young voyagers had at least one thousand miles of the Mississippi
to traverse before they arrived at their destination. The voyage was
successful, and raised the character of Abraham Lincoln in the
vicinity as a youth of energy and promise. In 1830, when Abraham was
twenty-one years of age, he migrated once more with his father to
Decatur, Illinois. The father being there comfortably settled, Abraham
started on his n account, hiring himself out first of all as a farm
hand, and occasionally acting as a clerk in a store. When the war with
the Indians broke out in 1832, commonly called the Black Hawk War,
Mr. Lincoln was elected to the command of a company of volunteers. One
who knew him at this period writes that "he was an efficient, faithful
officer, watchful of his men and prompt in the discharge of duty; and
his courage and patriotism shrank from no dangers or hardships." After
his military career, Lincoln kept a store; and then took to the
business of a surveyor. In 1834 he was sent to the local Legislature,
and during the time the House was not sitting he applied himself with
vigour to the study of law. In 1836 he obtained a license to practise;
and in 1837 went to Springfield, the chief town in Illinois, and
commenced as a lawyer, in partnership with the Hon. John F. Stuart. He
rose rapidly in public favour, and is said to have been very successful
as on advocate in jury trials. In 1846 Mr. Lincoln was returned to
Congress, and took his seat as the only Whig member from Illinois. He
continued to belong to Congress till 1849. The Whigs were the
forerunners of the present powerful Republican party, the chief point
of difference being that of slavery. Lincoln was for freedom, and on
that ground opposed the Mexican War. He supported a bill abolishing
slavery in the district of Columbia. When the Wilmot proviso was
discussed to exclude slavery from those territories which had been
captured from Mexico, Mr. Lincoln voted for the proviso; and he
afterwards stated that, in one way or another, he had cast his vote
about forty times in favour of the abolition of slavery. In 1849 he
stood, and was defeated, for the office of United States' Senator for
Illinois, and consequently remained at home from that period until
1854 in the practice of his profession. In that year the Kansas
Nebraska Bill was passed by the slaveholding party, aided by some of
their supporters in the North. Mr. Stephen A. Douglas stood for United
States' senator from Illinois, and Mr. Lincoln opposed him; the two
champions ultimately holding seven joint debates in different towns of
the State for the purpose of informing the people of the grounds of
difference of policy upon which they were called on to decide. Upon
his discussions with Douglas, however, the eyes of the whole country
were fixed, and the ability and quaint humour which Mr. Lincoln
exhibited, and the success which he gained for the party, made him
very popular among the Republicans. The immediate practical question
which then agitated the people, which came to be the turning-point of
the presidential election of 1860, was whether or not slavery ought to
be permitted in the new territories as, one by one, they came to be
peopled. Mr. Lincoln believed that slavery ought to be excluded from
the territories, although he did not see his way to interfere with
slavery in those States where it existed. The Republican Convention,
which met at Chicago, nominated Mr. Lincoln as their candidate for the
presidency. The contest lay between him and Mr. Seward. The canvass
was carried on with the usual good humour in the North, but amid
threatenings and mutterings in the South in the prospect of their
defeat. The palling resulted in the return of Mr. Lincoln--the numbers
being, for Lincoln, 1,8577,910; for Douglas, 1,291,574; for
Breckenridge, 850,082: and for Bell (a Whig of long standing),
646,124. The election, in 1860, of Mr. Lincoln was hailed with delight
by the people of the Northern States, and when he proceeded to
Washington to execute the functions of President the whole country
watched his progress with intense satisfaction. Mr. Lincoln's policy
was to woo the South to submission to the constitutionally-expressed
will of the people by every argument which would be supposed to have
weight with American citizens. His appeal was vain. The men to whom it
was addressed had for a long series of years encouraged the delusion
that slavery was a Divine institution. The North, with Mr. Lincoln as
President, had no choice but to enforce the laws and to use whatever
powers the Constitution gave for the suppression of the South, which
had burst out into open rebellion. The terrible war that followed and
its ever-varying incidents are too much matters of present knowledge
and history to need any detail here. Sufficient it is to say that in
the west the national arms were almost uniformly successful. In the
east the forces of the Union failed to capture Richmond until weary
years of effort had been wasted and several successive Generals tried
and removed. But the elasticity of free institutions permitted of
these changes of commanders, and the patriotism of the people
supported the President in whatever appointments he deemed best for
the furtherance of the cause until--by his happy selection of General
Grant, who had proved victorious in the west, and Grant's no less
admirable appointments of Generals Sherman, Sheridan, Thomas and
others--the power of the South has been completely battered down. The
emancipation proclamation of President Lincoln was one of his boldest
and greatest acts, and the cause of the Union seems to have prospered
ever since. Lincoln had been a second time elected President, and the
surrender of the Confederate army was just being looked on as the
closing-in scene of the mighty struggle, when President Lincoln fell
the victim of one of the foulest and most daring acts of assassination
that has ever disgraced the pages of history. Assassination is a crime
which seems to have peculiarly and invariably the curse of Heaven upon
it; for in perusing the annals of the world we find it has not only
not been followed by success, but it has been usually a fatal blow to
the cause in support of which the murderer has done the deed. No
doubt, therefore, this dreadful slaying of the President will tend
more than aught else to cause a revulsion in the minds of his
opponents and bring them round, and to thus establish the Northern
triumph permanently, and to effect the long-desired pacification of
America. President Lincoln died, on the 15th ult., from the shot fired
at him by John Wilkes Booth in Ford's Theatre, Washington, on the
previous evening. The President leaves a widow and family.</p></div2>

<p>The war may now be said to be virtually closed, for by the latest
advices from New York (to the 28th ult.) we learn that General
Johnston has surrendered all the forces under his command on the same
terms as those granted to General Lee; and the Confederate forces
still at large are of small importance.</p>
<p>At a meeting on the 18th ult. between General Sherman and General
Johnston, at which Mr. Breckenridge was present, an agreement was
drawn up which was virtually a treaty of peace. Hostilities were by it
suspended, and forty-eight hours' notice was to be given of their
resumption. The Confederate armies were to be disbanded, their arms
and public property being deposited in the State capitals. The State
Governments were to be recognised by the Federal Executive. Where
there were conflicting State Governments, the Supreme Court was to
decide as to the legitimacy of each of them. The civil and political
rights, and rights of property of the people, were to be recognised to
the extent of the law as written in the Constitution; and, finally, a
general amnesty was to be proclaimed. Sherman's action was promptly
repudiated by the Federal Government, chiefly on the ground that he
had no right to treat for peace, and that the terms of the agreement,
if acted upon, would guarantee the continuance of slavery. General
Grant at once went to Raleigh, and ordered hostilities to be resumed
and pressed forward without delay.</p>
<p>A despatch sent by General Grant, on the 26th ult., from Raleigh,
reported that General Johnston had surrendered to General Sherman all
the forces under his command--embracing all from Raleigh to the
Chattahoochie--upon terms the same as those granted by General Grant
to General Lee's army in Virginia. Private accounts stated that
General Johnston had endeavoured to obtain an amnesty and permission
for President Davis and other Confederate lenders to leave the
country, but that these demands were summarily rejected by General
Grant.</p>
<p>It was reported that General Taylor, who commands the only
Confederate force now in the field to the east of the Mississippi was
ready to surrender to General Canby, the captor of Mobile, if
"favourable" terms were granted to him. Nothing was known as to the
intentions of General Kirby Smith, who commands the Confederate forces
west of the Mississippi, but probably he has by this time accepted
conditions similar to those agreed to by Lee and Johnston.</p>
<p>It was asserted that Mr. Jefferson Davis, with an escort of 200
horse, had left Goldsborough for the Mississippi; and there had even
been a rumour that he had already crossed the Mississippi, on his way
into Texas.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Death of Booth.</hi></p>
<p>The death of President Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth, is
announced. It appears that Booth--whose leg had been broken by a fall
from horseback, but which had been set by a Maryland surgeon, named
Mudd, who has since been arrested--and an accomplice, named Harold,
were discovered to have taken refuge in a swamp in St. Mary's County,
Maryland. They were pursued, but seem to have found means to cross the
Potomac, and to reach a farm near Port Royal, on the Rappahannock.
There they were followed by a party of Federal horse, but they
barricaded themselves in a barn, and refused to surrender. The Federal
troopers then set fire to the barn, and in the affray which ensued
Harrold was taken alive and unhurt; but Booth was shot through the
head by a sergeant. He lived, however, about about three hours
afterwards, and found an interval to send a farewell message to his
mother. Booth's corpse and Harrold were taken into Washington on the
morning of the 27th ult. It is stated that Booth's body has been
buried privately, by order of the War Department. Junius Brutus Booth
has been arrested on suspicion that he was of his brother's
accomplices.</p>
<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">General News.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. Lincoln's remains were conveyed on the 215th ult., amid
popular demonstrations of mourning, from the City Hall, New York, to
the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t, en route for Albany, followed by the largest
procession ever assembled in that city, including the foreign Consuls,
detachments of military, and large numbers of citizens and coloured
people. Masses of people lined the streets through which the
procession passed. In the evening religious services were held by all
the sects in New York. A meeting was also held in Union-square, at
which Mr. Bancroft delivered an oration.</p>
<p>President Johnson has appointed June 1, instead of May 25, as a day
of humiliation on account of Mr. Lincoln's death.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward is rapidly regaining strength, and has already
been out riding. His son is out of danger.</p>
<p>Harrold has, so far, been quite reticent and morose. The trial is
to take place immediately.</p>
<p>Lewis Payne, the man who, it is supposed, attacked Mr. Seward, is
in gaol at Washington. He recently attempted to beat his brains out
against the iron bars of his cell, but was prevented, securely bound,
and his head incased in a wadded cap, in order to frustrate any
similar attempt at self-destruction.</p>
<p>Secretary Stanton has declared that he possessed information to
the effect that the assassination plot had been framed in Canada, and
approved at Richmond; and that the man apprehended at Washington, and
believed to be the assailant of Secretary Seward and sons, was one of
the St. Albans "raiders."</p>
<p>The changed aspect of the war has enabled the Government to reduce
the military expenditure a million dollars a day.</p>
<p>President Johnson had made a speech in which he stated that
leniency must be shown to the people of the South, but their leaders
must be punished.</p>
<p>Confederate prisoners who were willing to take th allegiance and
"become loyal citizens," and who were "proper objects of clemency,"
were to be released upon such terms as the President might deem "fit
and consistent with public safety."</p>
<p>A frightful calamity had occurred on the Mississippi, the
transport-steamer Sultana, with 2000 Federal soldiers on board, having
been destroyed on the 28th ult., near Memphis, by the explosion of her
boilers. Of the 2000 men on board, who are said to have been "paroled
prisoners," released by the Confederates, 1400 perished.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The American War Is Over.</hi> We are unaware
that it has ever been our duty to write five words which we have
written with more sincere thankfulness. The task of tracing the
history of this hideous conflict has been one which we have sought to
discharge faithfully, unwelcome as it was; and at the close of the
struggle we may fairly say that, while none of the splendid deeds of
the South blinded us to the fact that there was a black spot upon its
escutcheon, none of the harsh and unfriendly utterances of the North
in regard to England biassed us into doing less than justice to the
perseverance and vigour with which the Federals fought for the
Union. It may seem a small thing to add that we have always sought to
record the exact truth, in reference to the incidents of the war, so
far as we could ascertain the truth; but it is not entirely without
grounds that it has been laid to the charge of partisans on both sides
here that narratives of victory and defeat have not unfrequently been
coloured in accordance with party views. Let all these things be
forgotten, now that North and South are again joined, and</p>
<q><p rend="center">Fast as the "sword" can make them, they are
one.</p></q>
<p>Johnston's surrender, on the same terms that were accorded to Lee,
rapidly followed the repudiation of the more easy terms which Shaman
thought himself entitled to offer. There remain, of course, a number
of Confederate soldiers in the field; but that number is so reduced
that it is hardly to be supposed that they will make a stand. It may
be doubtful, indeed, whether their commanders would be justified by
military usage in attempting a resistance. They will, of course, be
allowed the same terms as the two armies which have
capitulated. Should they endeavour to hold out, the overwhelming
forces which will rapidly be hurled against them will inevitably crush
them. We may venture to hope, therefore, that the last death-shot has
been fired. But the war itself is over, whatever may remain to be
done.</p>
<p>Now have the new President and his advisers to address themselves
to the solution of the grandest problem which has ever been presented
to conquerors--the problem of real pacification. Nations in
insurrection have been subdued before now, but the conditions have
never resembled those in which Mr. Johnson finds the noble provinces
which have been regained to the Union by the sword. European despots
have fought with insurgents, and won the day; but it was to lay on new
chains and stamp out the last embers of hope. England was suddenly
defied by a fierce and monstrous revolt in the East; she closed with
the rebels, and they were given to the region kites; but, her terrible
work done and the lesson read, she had but to leave it to produce its
own effect. But in the Southern States the case is entirely
different. There is an absolute necessity for placing the Southerns at
the earliest moment that prudence permits in the possession of equal
rights with the rest of the population, and they must neither be
trampled upon nor left alone. They must be regained to the Union, not
only in name but in fact, and they must be aided in the reparation of
the ravages of war and invited and encouraged to be loyal co-operative
citizens. There is more. The operation of the war has deprived them of
the unpaid labour by which they were formerly supported. The North
should hardly be less generous to a vanquished brother than England
was to her own children. We compensated those from whom we took the
slave. We do not say that such compensation is due to men who removed
the quarrel from a national tribunal to a field of blood; but the warm
and true hearts of the Northern Americans will tell them that some
indulgences, be the form what it may, should be proffered to those who
have to learn to make bricks without straw. The moment has arrived
when the noblest statesmanship is required. The problem for solution
is very grand; and it will be seen whether republican institutions
have produced men who are competent to deal with such a crisis. Upon
the measures of the next six months depends the question whether the
Union shall be truly consolidated, or whether a vast and disaffected
population shall be left to watch for a new opportunity of
severance.</p>
<p>The miserable assassin of the President has perished miserably, as
he deserved. If he desired the &#x00E9;clat of a state trial and a
solemn execution, to be preceded by a theatrical speech, these things
have been denied him. He has not even had the gibbet and the parade
which he vaunted in having aided to prepare for John Brown. Injured by
some accident--perhaps his fall when he sprang past the wife of the
man he foully murdered and dropped on the stage--he was hunted from a
swamp into a barn, and he was brought down by a shot from a common
soldier's pistol. He escaped the gallows, and has been buried like a
dog. Except in connection with the trial of his accomplices, there is
no reason why his infamous name should again sully a page.</p>
<p>One thing more, and the greatest. Slavery is extinct in the United
States of America. On this record all men--certainly all
Englishmen--must look with unmixed satisfaction. In the winter of 1852
the ladies of England signed an address to the ladies of America, and
in respectful and affectionate language besought them to consider the
best means of making preparation for the abolition of slavery. The
document bore the names of nearly a hundred and fifty thousand
Englishwomen. Had that kindly prayer been heeded, it may be that the
horrors we have be recording for four years would have been spared;
but the subject was a large, a complex, and a difficult one, and it
was less easy to grapple with it than to bid Englishwomen mind their
own business and attend to the beggars in Ireland and in the dens of
London. Still, we believe that the appeal sank deep into many hearts
in the West, and confirmed many more in their desire for a peaceful
settlement of the question. But it was decreed that it should not be
settled peaceably; and four years of the most sanguinary warfare have
been needed to break chains which we should so gladly have seen
quietly unlocked. But the work is done, and the Slave is Free. There
is much, very much, of deep and enduring sorrow in the sight which is
now to be seen in America; but for this victory of freedom we may all
thank God.</p></div2>

<p>The New York Emigration Commissioners have issued their report for
1864. They state that in the course of the year there landed at New
York 222,338 passengers, of whom 39,422 were American citizens and
182,916 were aliens, the latter number being 27,072 more than in
1863. 89,766 of the aliens were Irish, 23,871 English, 57,579
Germans. The commissioners provided employment, food, lodging, or
transportation for 28,957; cared for 7363 in the refuge and hospital
of the commission, and for 235 in its smallpox hospital; and for 978
did the service of burying them.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE MOURNING FOR PRESIDENT LINCOLN IN<lb/><hi
rend="smallcaps">BROADWAY, NEW YORK.</hi></p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> aspect of the principal streets in
the city of New York for two or three days after the news of the death
of President Lincoln was full of signs of public grief and
consternation. Our New York correspondent sends a sketch of the
appearance of Broadway on the 18th ult., which is reproduced in our
Engraving. He observes that this sad scene afforded a striking
contrast to that which had been displayed in the same city
immediately before. "For several days previously," he says, "New York
had presented quite a carnival appearance; for the surrender of Lee
with his army was hailed as the harbinger of peace, which has so long
been earnestly desired by the mass of the people. The great
thoroughfares of the city were all a-flutter with flags, and one or
two days of this week were to have been devoted to the celebration of
the recent successes with which the Federal arms had been crowned. But
Easter Sunday dawned upon a city dark and sepulchral as a city of the
dead. Scarce a house in it but has been draped in the deepest mourning
since three days ago when the news of the great national calamity fell
like a thunderbolt upon the whole American community. Long festoons of
black and white muslin are drooping sadly everywhere, and even the gay
show-cases that stand outside the shop doors are dressed with funereal
rosettes. Street boys are selling little mourning badges consisting of
ambrotype likenesses of the murdered chief magistrate, tied up with
knots of crape." Another correspondent says, "there still seems no
desire to resume business until after the funeral of the lamented
President. Each hour increases the gloomy appearance of the city. In
every street the houses are decked with crape, with portraits of
Mr. Lincoln hung about with garlands entwined with black, while in
many places huge black crosses are in the windows of houses winch
remain closed all day, seemingly deserted. It is inexpressibly sad,
this outward show of grief; while that it is sincere is proved by the
gloomy looks, the tearful eyes, of those who are to be met in the
streets. In many places the decorations, though sombre, are
exceedingly picturesque, the dark tones being relieved by the bright
red and blue of the national colours entwined with crape. The public
buildings are many of them hung from dome to basement with long folds
of black cloth disposed most artistically; and, as these buildings are
of white marble, the effect may be imagined. On Broadway some of the
stores are thus decorated, while others have huge palls hanging from
the roof to the street. All is dark, gloomy, grand. The expression of
grief is, I dare assert, the most universal, most sincere, most
impressive ever witnessed."</p></div2>

<p>....And Mr. Wilkes Booth, what of him? A struggle, a summons, a
defiance, and a shot, and there is an end of him. It is well that it
is so, save that we needed from his lips--and may have had--a distinct
denial of any complicity of the South with the act of one whose
patriotism ran to seed in wild madness. More than 250 addresses of
condolence, or utterances of horror at the deed, have gone forth from
England to America, and Mr. Tenniel's cartoon, which, unhappily, was
rather too hastily executed, of Britannia sympathising with Columbia
is true to the letter. By-the-way, Americans here present have been
charmed with the noble verses which accompanied <hi
rend="italic">Punch's</hi> woodcut, and many have said that the manly
recantation therein will do more to knit the heart of America to that
of England than anything which has been written--yes, even than the
Queen's letter. the verses will be reprinted in every paper throughout
the States. President Lincoln's death--let us have the courage to say
it--is not an unmixed evil, or at least not an evil out of which good
will not spring. It has brought, at one sudden turn, France and
England to the side of America; it has severed the last tie which
bound President Davis and his Southerners together; and it has given
the Americans the image of a good, earnest, duty-loving man to set
before them as an ideal corrective of restless political craving and
a purposeless, noisy ambition....</p></div2>

<p>By the North American and the City of Washington we have New York
news to the 6th inst.</p>
<p>President Johnson had issued a proclamation offering a reward of
100,000 dollars for the arrest of Mr. Jefferson Davis, who was said to
have been on the 28th ult. at Yorkville, on the northern border of
South Carolina, and to have had some Federal cavalry only one day's
march in his rear. Charges of implication in President Lincoln's
assassination have been made against Mr. Davis, also against Jacob
Thompson, Clement C. Clay, Beverly Tucker, George N. Sanders,
W. C. Cleary, and "other rebel traitors against the United States
Government, harboured in Canada," for whose apprehension rewards are
offered. The charge has, however, been indignantly denied by them in
the Canadian journals.</p>
<p>The formal surrender of General Johnston's forces, which were
stated to number 27,000 men, took place at Greensborough on the 29th
ult. The main body of General Sherman's army was about to march
northwards; but General Schofield's corps was to remain in North
Carolina.</p>
<p>Mr. Mallory, the Confederate Secretary of the navy, has given
himself up to the Federal authorities at Pensacola.</p>
<p>At Memphis an order had been issued announcing that after a
certain date those of the Confederates who have not surrendered will
not be treated as prisoners of war.</p>
<p>The reduction of the Federal armies has been begun by a discharge
of convalescent and paroled soldiers; and it was said that as many as
400,000 men would be immediately disbanded.</p>
<p>President Johnson made a speech to the Pennsylvania delegation
reiterating that the severest penalties of the law would be inflicted
upon the rebel leaders. He has issued a proclamation removing the
restrictions on trade, except in articles contraband of war, with
the Southern States east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Chase and a treasury agent have left for the South,
the organise the law courts and trade regulations.</p>
<p>A Confederate iron-clad steamer, named the Webb, said to have been
laden with cotton, ran out of the mouth of the Red river on the 23rd
ult., and succeeded in passing the Federal squadron. She proceeded
down the Mississippi, and passed New Orleans on the 25th, but before
she had passed the forts she encountered a Federal frigate coming up
the river, and her captain ran her ashore and burned her.</p>
<p>Mr. Seward was nearly restored to health, and his son is improving
gradually.</p>
<p>The newspapers were discussing the terms on which a
"reconstruction" of the Union is to be effected; and the chief
difference of opinion appeared to be on the question whether negroes
shall be admitted as voters.</p>
<p>An advertisement had been published in a Washington paper inviting
officers and soldiers to go to Mexico, and other papers hint at
filibustering expeditions thither.</p>
<p>It is said that among Mr. Lincoln's papers has been found a
package of letters marked, in his own handwriting, "Assassination
Letters." While many of them threatened his life, others warned him of
plots to take it.</p></div2>

so-called Confederate States as belligerents was to be withdrawn by
the Government.--Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> thought the
question ill-timed. The President of the United States, when he
declared the ports of the South blockaded, left the Government no
choice but either to refuse to acknowledge the blockade or to
recognise the South as belligerents. Under the blockade the United
States had the right of search of neutral vessels, and that right had
been exercised with great severity. So long as they continued to
maintain the right of search it must be assumed that war continued to
exist. The order as to Federal vessels of war not staying more than
twenty-four hours in a British port might be relaxed; but until the
United States Government said whether they intended to continue or
discontinue the right of search he could not answer the question of
the noble Lord. If the United States should declare the war at an end,
the Government would refer the question of what should be done to the
law officers of the Crown.</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi

<p rend="center"><hi rend="smallcaps">Belligerent Rights Of The

<p>Mr. <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi> asked the first Lord of the
Treasury whether the Government had determined to withdraw its
recognition of the belligerent rights of the (so-called) Confederate
States of America.</p>
<p>Lord <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston</hi>, who was received with
loud and general cheering, rose to answer the question. The noble Lord
spoke with fully his usual animation and rigour. He said the course of
transactions with regard to belligerent rights of the two parties has
been this:--The President of the United States issued a proclamation
declaring a strict blockade of all the coasts and certain ports in the
Southern Confederacy, in accordance, as he stated, with the law of
nations. Now a blockade is, according to the law of nations, a
belligerent right, which can only accrue to a State which is at
war. The fact of the President of the United States declaring a
blockade in accordance with the law of nations gave him, according to
that claim, all those rights which belong to a belligerent declaring a
blockade--the right of capture, condemnation, and the right of search
with regard to neutral vessels. The British Government had but one of
two courses to pursue--either to refuse to submit, on the part of
British vessels, to those belligerent rights, on the ground, which
might have been assumed, that there was no formal belligerent on the
other side. That was not thought expedient, and therefore the only
course to pursue was to acknowledge and to submit to these belligerent
rights. But that necessarily involved the acknowledgment that the
other party was also a belligerent and entitled to the rights of a
belligerent. Whenever the Government of the United States shall
declare that it ceases to exercise with regard to neutrals those
rights of search, capture, and condemnation which belong to
belligerents, then the war, as far as neutrals are concerned, ceases,
and there will be no acknowledgment of belligerents either on one side
or the other....</p>
<p rend="center">HOUSE OF COMMONS.--<hi
rend="smallcaps">Thursday.</hi></p>
<p>Mr. D. Griffith gave notice that, to-morrow, he would call
attention to the reward offered by the President of the United States
for the capture of Mr. Jefferson Davis, and ask the noble Lord at the
head of the Government whether he would intimate to the Government of
the United States that a resort to any extremities would be deplored
by the whole civilised world....</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> first vessel that went up the James
River to Richmond after the evacuation of that city by the
Confederates on Monday, April 3, was a private yacht, the steamer
Octavia, of 430 tons, built in America, but belonging to an English
gentleman, Mr. T. W. Kennard, the chief engineer of the Atlantic and
Great Western Railway, who was accompanied by his son and several
other gentlemen in this early visit to the fallen capital of the
south. We have been favoured by Mr. Kennard with the sketches from
which our Illustrations on page 481 are engraved. One of them is a
view of Fort Powhattan, with the encampment on the extreme left of the
Federal position before Petersburg, about half way up the river in
going from Fortress Monroe to Richmond. The yacht passed this place on
the Monday morning, and saluted with two guns. The salute was returned
by Fort Powhattan, and the troops cheered. At that hour Mr. Kennard
had not heard of the evacuation of Petersburg and Richmond, which had
taken place the sane morning; but he met a number of large steamers,
crammed with Confederate prisoners, coming down the river. Upon his
arrival at City Point, the head-quarters of General Grant, he learnt
that both Petersburg and Richmond were abandoned, and the Confederate
army in full retreat. Mr. Kennard then landed at City Point, and
called upon General Collis, the Federal officer in command. Next
morning, having been summoned by Admiral Porter to attend on board the
flagship, Mr. Kennard did so, and made a satisfactory apology for
having ventured, without a pass, to bring his yacht up the river, as
the Federal authorities had ordered that no vessel should go above
Fortress Monroe. The next two or three days were spent in exploring
Petersburg and the country around that town. On the Friday Mr. Kennard
and his party proceeded to Richmond. He gives the following account of
his visit to the ruined city:--</p>
<p>"After waiting some hours on that day at the bridge over the
Appomattox, at Petersburg, for the rails to be laid down for us, we
safely crossed over on to the Richmond Railway in the first United
States car that had run on the line for years past. En route to the
fallen city we passed exploded ammunition-trains and railway
d&#x00E8;bris, not forgetting numbers of niggers profuse in broad
grins, salutations, and elaborate bows. These poor fellows were only
too glad to let us have all the Confederate currency they had about
them in exchange for any trifle we liked to give. Upon arriving at
Manchester, on the south side of James River, we found the fine
rail-bridge, three quarters of a mile long, destroyed by fire. Nothing
remained but the stone piers. All the other bridges were destroyed in
the same way, and we entered the town over a bridge of boats thrown
across by the Federal troops. The scene of ruin and devastation
presented on entering the place is beyond description. The main
street, and the entire blocks of buildings stretching down to the
river, had been totally destroyed by fire--some<pb n="481"/> say by
order of General Ewell, others by accident. At any rate, nearly half
the city has been reduced to ashes, notwithstanding the efforts of the
Federal troops to arrest the flames. Only one hotel was open, and but
few shops, and those very bare of goods. The Capitol was visited, also
Jeff Davis's house, Castle Thunder, and the notorious Libby prison,
crammed to overflowing with Confederate prisoners. Both are miserably
small holes, originally warehouses. The stories heard with regard to
the treatment of Federal prisoners in the Libby are contradictory; one
Colonel, who, with 150 other officers, had been confined in it for
three months, speaks well of the treatment; on the other hand, there
are statements of shocking ill-treatment and suffering. One of the
first regiments in the city was negro, and black troops were on guard
in every street.</p>
<p>"No pillage or destruction of property had taken place; and, to the
great honour of the Federal arms be it fairly said, never before did
cities like Petersburg and Richmond, entered by excited troops after
years of siege, suffer to so trifling an extent. Tobacco was the only
temptation that could not be resisted. There was not a whisper amongst
the inhabitants conversed with, other than that they had been treated
in the most humane and proper manner. We can all certify to the fact
that out of the thousands upon thousands of troops we have seen only
one man has been detected the worse for drink. This is accounted for
by the fact that spirits are forbidden both in the army and navy on
service. One could not fail to remark the deep mourning worn by the
ladies moving about the streets, or the careworn expression of their
countenances. The 'darkie' element, on the contrary, was decidedly
jubilant. The return to City Point was by way of the James River
steamers having arrived while we were in the town. We thus had an
opportunity of seeing part of the vast system of fortifications and
works that surrounded the fallen city, extending over eighty
miles. The number of guns left by the Confederates must have been
enormous. The celebrated Atlanta was lying in the neighbourhood of
Dutch Gap, in company with five Federal monitors. The gap appears
about 200 yards in length, cut through a very high bank, under fire of
the Confederate guns. Had the work been successfully carried out,
seven miles of batteries through which the gauntlet had to be run by
the invading fleet would have been saved. From the enormous strength
of the shore batteries and number of torpedoes sunk it seems almost
impossible that any ship could have reached Richmond. Suspicious
little red flags stack in floating logs of wood commanded the greatest
possible respect from the man at the wheel. These had been placed by a
torpedo-hunting gun-boat to mark the proximity of its deadly game; but
not without reason was this respect paid, for it is rumoured a
river-steamer that passed us an route to Richmond deviated from the
proper course, struck a torpedo and was sunk, the majority of those on
board being killed. The torpedoes fished up by the hunters were lying
on each bank--one containing no less than 1700 lb. of powder. In all
excursions some of the party get adrift. One of ours did on this
occasion, a circumstance he had no reason to regret, as he passed the
evening with General Weitzel, who occupies Jeff Davis's house, and
visited points of interest in the fugitive President's
carriage. Saturday was spent at City Point in making our adieus to all
those who had shown our party such great and unusual attentions. We
saw a train of 2000 men dispatched to bring back some 12,000 prisoners
captured on Thursday, including General Ewell and five other
generals. Upon our way back to the yacht the English portion of the
party called upon the President, who had been here for some time on
board the River Queen steamer. The President received us with the
greatest courtesy and we enjoyed a long and interesting conversation
with him, not the least amusing part of it being a history he gave of
General Grant's career, winding up with a happy anecdote of a boyhood
adventure of the General. The President looked very careworn, and with
feeling expressed his delight at the prospect of a speedy close of
this dreadful war."</p>
<p>There is a melancholy interest now belonging to this record of so
late a conversation with President Lincoln whose fate was not known
when Mr. Kennard wrote his letter. A view of the City of Richmond, and
that of Mr. Jefferson Davis's House, are likewise engraved from
Mr. Kennard's sketches.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> funeral of the late President
Lincoln, as we have already reported, commenced on the 19th ult. The
body had lain in state under the dome of the Capitol in Washington and
had been visited by thousands of people. The members of the Cabinet,
with other friends of the deceased, assembled at six o'clock in the
morning on the 19th, and, after a brief religious service, the coffin
was taken from the catafalque and placed in the hearse which was
waiting to receive it in front of the Capitol. The procession was then
formed, and escorted the remains to the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t of the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, in New Jersey-avenue, where a
special train had been prepared for their conveyance. In front of the
procession marched the Veteran Reserve Corps, under command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Bell; following them came the hearse with the
coffin, beside which was a guard of honour composed of a detail of
twelve orderly sergeants from the Veteran Reserve Corps, under the
command of Captain J. M. M'Camley of the 9th, and Lieutenants
J. R. Durkee of the 7th, E. Hoppy of the 12th, and E. Murphy of the
10th Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps. Immediately following the hearse,
on foot, came Lieutenant-General Grant, Brigadier-General Hardie,
Brigadier-Generals Barnard, Rucker, Ekin, Howe, Eaton, Townsend, and
M'Callum, and Major-Generals Hunter and Meigs, Admiral Davis and
Captain W. R. Taylor of the navy, and Major Field of the marine
corps. Behind them were several carriages, in which were Secretaries
Stanton, Welles, and M'Culloch; Postmaster-General Denison and
Attorney-General Speed; Major B. B. French, Commissioner of Public
Buildings; Commissioners Dole, of the Indian Bureau; Holloway, of the
Patent Bureau; Captain Newman, of the Capitol Police; Governor
Oglesby, Senator Yates, and ex-Senator Browning, of Illinois; the
Illinois delegation, which took charge of the remains on behalf of
that State; and a number of other senators and members of
Congress. President Johnson's carriage was in the procession,
accompanied by the President's body-guard, mounted, which closed the
procession. The coffin was carried into the d&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t,
followed by the gentlemen before mentioned, civil and military, and
deposited in the car, which had been prepared for its reception. A
prayer was repeated by the Rev. Dr. Gurley; and the train, decked with
funeral trappings, started from Washington at eight o'clock. It
arrived at Baltimore about ten, when the coffin was borne to the
Exchange, and lay there in state till the next day. The same ceremony
took place at Harrisburg and Philadelphia on the two following
days.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 24th ult., the funeral arrived at New York. A
correspondent in that city, from whose sketch one of our
Illustrations is engraved, describes the scene as follows:--</p>
<p>"The remains were escorted from the railway station by the
favourite regiment of New York, the 7th. The funeral car in which the
body was conveyed was decorated with eight black-and-white plumes and 
draped with the national flag. It was drawn by six grey horses,
heavily draped and plumed, and led by soldiers. The street which the
cort&#x00E9;ge passed were lined with dense crowds of people
representing all classes of society and creeds of politics; for,
whatever differences of opinion might have existed with regard to
Abraham Lincoln while living and holding the reins of Government in
his hands, they are all merged now in sorrow for his untimely fate,
and detestation of the assassin who has brought the nation to this
great grief. As soon as the body had been carried into the City Hall
and placed upon the catafalque prepared for its reception, a solemn
dirge burst forth from a choir of 900 Germans, who, dressed in black
and with their heads uncovered, were ranged in close array upon each
side of the steps leading up to the City Hall, the space in front of
which was kept clear by a strong force of policemen and by detachments
of the 8th Regiment. Outside this cordon the crowd was immense, but,
like, most American crowds, quite orderly. From noon yesterday until
noon to-day the body lay in state in the Rotunda of the City Hall,
within a lofty catafalque erected at the head of the stairway leading
to the Governor's Room. The coffin was placed in a sloping position
beneath the canopy, the upper part of it being open, so as to display
the features of the murdered Chief Magistrate. A guard of honour,
composed of officers of the army and navy, remained in constant
attendance near the body. All day and all night a silent procession of
citizens--men and women, old and young, rich and poor--moved past the
coffin in single file, winding up the stairs on one side and down by
the other. Many floral tributes were laid upon the coffin, some of
them composed of camellias and other rare flowers. On the afternoon of
the second day (the 25th) the remains left New York, by way of Albany
and Buffalo. They arrive at Springfield, Illinois, on the afternoon of
the 31st, and will be interred there with all possible
honours."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....Two contradictory signs are visible in America. One peaceful
and happy, the other lurid and threatening. On the one hand, we are
told general Grant is "mustering out" 400,000 men--nearly half a
million of armed men, at one stroke; secondly, that President Johnson,
who once or twice made such spread-eagle speeches about the
armour-bearer of Jove--i.e., the American Eagle--and the British Lion,
is bent on a pacific course, and that he really desires to cultivate
the British alliance. But, on the other hand, it is very plain that
the Emperor of Mexico is somewhat disturbed and that the old Mexican
Republic is is making overtures to the North American Union; and, at a
meeting in New York, gentlemen were both publicly and privately
assured that those who promised to support the Monroe doctrine could
do so without compromising, or, to use the precise words, "without
involving themselves or the Government in trouble." Does this point
to filibustering? And what are we to understand of the President's
proclamation which directly implicates Canada? The advertisement which
begs all discharged soldiers and officers to register their names with
Colonel Washington and to "emigrate" to Mexico seems ominous. Shall we
have more Rifle Rangers, and Captain Mayne Reid, promoted to a
General, as their leader? Mr. Jefferson Davis has friends even in the
New York press, who deny that he has taken any treasure with him in
the eleven waggons which follow, or rather followed, this deposed
President. If he be caught, with Messrs. Breckenridge and Secretary
Benjamin, there will be a grand trial, and no doubt manly deaths on
the scaffold; for President Johnson, urged "to regard Davis as the
common enemy of the human race," will punish all traitors with the
"utmost severity." Treason, says President Johnson, "is the greatest
of all crimes," and the people and General Walbridge approved of
it. Shade of George Washington, listen to this utterance! How the old
world-wisdom is vindicated! How true is Sir John Harrington's
epigram--</p>
<p rend="center">Treason doth <hi rend="italic">never</hi> prosper;
what's the reason?<lb/>For if it prosper none dare call it
treason.</p>
<p>No, treason is not quite the greatest of crimes; but want of
success is.</p></div2>

<p>The pacification of the country seems to be rapidly
progressing. General Dick Taylor has surrendered his forces to General
Canby. The interview between the two Generals for arranging the terms,
which were similar to those granted to Lee and Johnston, took place at
Magee's Plantation, fourteen miles north of Mobile, on the 4th
inst. In some quarters however, there is evidence of a disposition not
to give in. Kirby Smith has published an appeal to his soldiers, dated
Shrieveport, April 21, denouncing Lee's surrender and exhorting them
to stand by their colours. He says that his resources are ample to
protract the struggle until foreign aid arrives, or until such time as
they can secure terms worthy of a proud people. The people of Houston,
Texas, passed resolutions on the 22nd ult. to continue the
struggle. The trans-Mississippi department was declared to be
sufficiently vast and full of resources to repel invasion, ensure
independence, and sustain Davis. "Some thought otherwise," adds the
telegram, laconically.</p>
<p>Jefferson Davis had not been captured. When last heard of he was at
Powell Town, Hancock County, a little north-east of Milledgeville,
Georgia. A close watch is being kept on the coast to prevent his
escape.</p>
<p>Several orders have been issued having in view the reorganisation
of the South. These show, in the first place, that there will be no
undue severity exercised on the people; next, that slavery is
everywhere absolutely extinguished and the freed men put under the
guardianship of the Federal forces, which for the present will occupy
the country; and, finally, that trade is to be fully reopened.</p>
<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation calling for renewed
efforts to capture rebel cruisers. He goes onto say that he will
refuse hospitality to the ships of neutral nations who may
henceforward give hospitality in their ports to rebel cruisers.</p>
<p>In an address to the coloured population, President Johnson said
that he trusted the time would come when all the coloured people would
be assembled in one country, best adapted to their condition, if it
should appear that they could not get along with the whites. He
declared that man could not hold property in man.</p>
<p>The trial of the Booth conspirators, which began on the 9th inst.,
is proceeding, with closed doors. The prisoners pleaded not
guilty.</p>
<p>According to the <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi>, Johnson's
proclamation offering rewards for the arrest of Mr. Davis and others
was issued upon the opinion of the Judge Advocate-General that
evidence proved Mr. Davis to be connected with the inception and
execution of the Booth plot, though it is not supposed that direct
personal action can be traced to him.</p>
<p>A Mexican emigration company has been formed in New York, with
agencies throughout the United States, and has advertised for naval
and military emigrants. A large number has already been enlisted. It
was, however, confidently anticipated that the Federal Government
would enforce the neutrality laws as regarded the Mexican
enlistments.</p>
<p>There is an increasing exodus from Canada to the United States. The
inhabitants of Lower Canada are emigrating in large
numbers.</p></div2>

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mr. Simon Tappertit</hi>, to whom Mr. Dickens
did me the honour of introducing me (with a few other favoured
persons) some years ago, had a secret society, bound by a dreadful
oath, the aim of which was to overthrow the tyrant masters, rescue the
gallant apprentices, slay the beadles, massacre the watchmen, seize
the Compter, strangle the City Chamberlain (the great enemy of all
City 'prentices), and, after due trial, behead the Lord Mayor. It is
true that the celebrated author did not permit Mr. Tappertit to reveal
all this; indeed, Mr. Sim, who used to "eye over" all suspected
persons, would have been torn, like Ravaillac, with horses, or grilled
on a bed of red-hot steel like Damien, rather than say one word; but
we inferred, such dreadful note of preparation lay in his frown, that
such was his intention. Poor, brave, misguided Tappertit! how much his
society resembles that of our Fenian heroes who, as the Jefferson
Brick of the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> writes with
scornful sarcasm, "ardently desire to crush the Kannucks and the dirty
Britishers, and wrench Ireland from the giant grasp of a bloated
aristocracy." I have many a time given a pet bit of quotation from
that pretty little green book, the "Spirit of the Nation." That book
will become historic; it is to be now the text-book of the invading
Fenians. Tom Davis, whose spirit is now "riding the whirlwind,"
Mr. Gavan Duffy, D. F. M'Carthy, Sliabb Cuillin, and others, will be
the Tyrt&#x00E6;i of the Fenians. The "Muster of the North," of which
the <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> quotes one line, will be
sung by millions of voices--</p>
<q><p>Glory to God, my eyes have seen the ransomed fields of
Down!<lb/>
My ears have drunk the joyful news, "stout Phelim has his own!"<lb/>
And gladsome bell, and bugle horn, from Newry's captured towers, Hark!
how they tell the Saxon swine, this land is <hi
rend="smallcaps">ours</hi>!</p></q>
<p>Seriously speaking, that was a document not wholly to be laughed at
which the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> gave on Tuesday from the <hi
rend="italic">New York Herald.</hi> A child's squib may set a house on
fire, and it is unpleasant to have a fowling-piece, loaded only with
gunpowder, peeping in your ear.</p>
<p>In Mexico the first faint drops of the thunderstorm seem to have
fallen. The officers of Maximilian refuse his Majesty's commission,
and Juarez has no lack of merry men who are going out as
emigrants. With grim satire we are told that these American emigrants
will be furnished with arms to protect themselves against robbers. A
few Parrott guns, a Dahlgren or so, and the most approved of modern
cartridges will be added; and a piece of bunting, commonly known as
the "gridiron," alias the stars and stripes, will be used to frighten
away birds from the upspringing crops of these peaceable <hi
rend="italic">incola.</hi> 'Tis a mad world, my masters! The dragon's
teeth have been sown, and the crop is not dead yet....</p>
<p>Those irrepressible Bonapartes are at it again. Fresh from the tomb
of Mdme. M&#x00E8;re, the <hi rend="italic">mater regum</hi>, Prince
Napoleon--that Junius Brutus of the occasion, that lover of everything
Roman except that which is austere--has made a speech eulogising the
first Emperor for his ardent attachment to Republicanism! Napoleon
Bonaparte, indeed, loved Republicanism as much as a nurse loves the
baby whom she overlays and smothers out of existence. But we are
always discovering fresh virtues in the martyred saint of
St. Helena. He loved American Republicanism and, by a kind of
prophetic prevision, he hated the aristocrats of the South. It is
indeed easy to hate those who are down. They debate now with closed
doors, and before an unreported tribunal, the fate of some of those
aristocrats--such Robert Lee and Jefferson Davis--at Washington. The
best French papers are earnestly in favour of the conquered South, and
tremble lest anyone should first raise the cry of "<hi
rend="italic">V&#x0153; Victis!</hi>" One might praise democracy
another way; the appeal to the many is sure to be answered. A great
man would try and <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> the many, even though he
failed. But if the Prince's speech was in bad taste, the <hi
rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> acted in worse taste in excluding it; and
now, all society in Paris talks--for its usual three hours--about the
coolness of the Emperor, the anger of the Court, and the rashness of
that headstrong youth, Plon-Plon. Verily the French kaleidoscope is
very prettily turned!</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE CAPTURE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">One</hi> of the instincts which a high state
of civilisation has developed in men is that which prompts them to
draw a wide distinction between political and criminal offences. Some
of our most highly reputed moralists have maintained the right of
insurrection, condemning the exercise of it only when it is resorted
to without due consideration of the means it can command for ensuring
success. That which we call "treason" when it loses its cause, we
glorify as "patriotism" when it wins; and, in common estimation, the
interval between the two diminishes in proportion as the efforts which
are made at change, by armed force, either the form or the course of
no existing Government approach the attainment of their object. We do
not think it necessary to test the foundation upon which this
sentiment rests. It suffices that it not only exists but prevails in
every civilised community the main guarantees of whose liberty have
been wrested from <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> rulers by military
means. Our own political<pb n="518"/> Constitution and the
independence of the United States owe their origin to movements which
unquestionably might have failed, and which, if they had, would have
figured in history as unjustifiable revolts. Success has consecrated
them; but common-sense teaches us that the good fortune which turned
the scale in their favour could not affect the morality of the agents
who initiated them, and that, had.the results been other than they
were, the men who risked their all in attempting to achieve them would
have been in all essential respects unchanged in character, although,
instead of extorting the homage of mankind, their names might possibly
have been blackened with infamy.</p>
<p>Neither here nor, we should think, in America, can the capture of
Mr. Davis, the political chief of the late Confederation, be regarded
as matter for congratulation by those who look far ahead. The desire
that he might not be so entangled in the ruins of the political
edifice which the North had overturned as to prevent his escape from
personal danger was all but universal. Men who seriously disapproved
of the course which he had pursued felt it as strongly as men who
admired and applauded it--the latter on account of sympathy with the
man, with the object at which he had aimed, and with the energy and
courage he had displayed in the prosecution of it--the former, because
the issue of the contest could not be made more complete by the
punishment of any who took an unsuccessful part in it; because a
struggle which has enlisted the enthusiastic and self-sacrificing
support of millions for the space of four years cannot be relegated to
the position of a municipal crime; and because any exhibition of
vindictive feeling by the North can have no other effect than that of
making reconciliation with the South more difficult and hopeless. On
all accounts, and with regard to all the parties concerned, it
appeared highly desirable that the leading men of the late Confederacy
should succeed in getting clear of the pursuit of their
antagonists.</p>
<p>The event has fallen out quite otherwise. Mr. Jefferson Davis has
been taken, as have also three or four of his most intimate
associates. Their camp at Irwinsville, seventy-five miles southeast of
Macon, was surprised, and the fugitive-in-chief, it is reported,
attempting to make good his escape disguised as a woman, was
apprehended by troopers. We have observed with pain, not unmingled
with disgust, a misplaced effort in some quarters to make merry over
the latter circumstance. Assuming the truth of the statement made to
Major-General Wilson by his men, we see no ground in it for this
attempt to disparage Mr. Davis's personal courage. Let the same
criticism which has found amusement in such an incident exhibit a like
levity over the devices resorted to for concealment by Charles II., or
by the young Pretender of 1745, and the good taste of society will
very speedily frown it out of countenance. The man who was the soul of
an enterprise which required the utmost pertinacity as well as the
largest sacrifices on the part of twenty millions of people to put
down, might have been reasonably thought beyond the reach of that
petty malice which can detect ignominy in a not uncommon <hi
rend="italic">ruse</hi> to evade pressing danger. The only thing about
it to he deplored is that it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The people of the United States would very gladly, we think, have
been spared the further trial of their magnanimity to which this
capture will expose them. The surrender of General Lee had all but
quenched their fiery passions when the assassination of president
Lincoln occurred to rekindle vindictive instincts. The excitement
occasioned by that event was subsiding when Mr. Davis was
apprehended. What will be done with him? If it can be proved that he
was accessory to murder there will be an end to embarrassment, for in
that case the sympathy of all men will be instantly withdrawn from him. But who anticipates this? None, we venture to surmise, but those who have cherished towards him feelings of personal antipathy. No; the charge which he will, doubtless, be put upon his trial to answer is that of treason--that of having levied war against the Government of the United States; the legal penalty of
 it is for Congress to declare. Every step, it may be presumed, will
be taken with due solemnity. The prisoner will have a fair trial; his
offence will be proved; the verdict will go against him; he will
perhaps be sentenced to the death of a felon! And what then? Most
thoughtful people on both Continents are asking this question with no
little anxiety--what then? Let us look at it for a moment.</p>
<p>If the sentence should be fully carried into effect, it is
difficult, at least for European onlookers, to discover what benefit
will accrue therefrom to the American Union. True, the Government at
Washington might cite, in defence of an extreme course, not a few Old
World precedents, some of which might be selected from English annals;
but their ability to do this would not dispose of the fact that public
opinion as to the mode of dealing with political offences has
undergone considerable change since the commencement of the present
century, and nowhere more decidedly than in the United States. Judging
from the temper displayed by the people of the North during the brief
interval between the surrender of General Lee and the assassination of
President Lincoln, nothing would have been more in accordance with
their wishes than the proclamation of a general amnesty; and it may be
safely inferred, from the spontaneity and universality of that
outburst of kindly sentiment, that severity in wielding the sword of
justice is not required to satisfy popular feeling. It can hardly be
pleaded that it is necessary to the safety of the Government, the
military collapse of the Confederacy having proved so complete as to
render further deterrent measures quite superfluous. Public policy
does not demand it, inasmuch as the speedy conciliation of the South
is the one point at which true statesmanship should now aim, and the
ignominious execution of Mr. Davis would serve only to add a last drop
of bitterness to the cup of humiliation handed to her, and to encircle
the name of her foremost man with an aureola of martyrdom. Finally,
it would largely abate from the sympathy which late events have
elicited from foreign nation, and cast a shade upon the glory which
evermore awaits those who pluck victory from midst great difficulties
and dangers. We do not discuss the Constitutional doubts involved in
the case; but, on the assumption that Mr. Davis has been guilty of
treason against the sovereignty of the United States, we contend that
the circumstances which in this instance surround the offence
powerfully recommend the exercise of clemency.</p>
<p>We believe it will rest with Congress to declare, in the almost
certain event of Mr. Davis's conviction, the nature of his
punishment. If so, we are not without hope that, through its highest
organ of expression, the nation will pronounce a lenient sentence. It
is not to be expected that the prisoner will receive immediate and
plenary pardon. But we entertain the hope that his life may be spared,
and that exile for the remainder of his days from the American
continent will be considered as heavy a doom as expediency and public
policy render imperative. Much embarrassment might be avoided by the
adoption of some such course; general respect, both at home and
abroad, would, we think, be gained by it. All that is thought to be
due to the majesty of the law, and to justice, would be secured; while
the least possible violence would be done to the sentiments of
humanity, which are strong in the bosom of civilised communities. Our
kinsmen across the water will, we earnestly trust, remember and
illustrate the language of the bard whom they as well as we
revere--</p>

INTELLIGENCE.</hi></p>
<p rend="center">AMERICA.</p>
<p>We were able to give in a considerable portion of our last
Impression the highly-important intelligence brought by the Scotia,
which arrived yesterday week, of the capture of Jefferson Davis, with
his family and Staff. They were surprised and captured by Wilson's
cavalry, at a place called Irwinsville, seventy miles south-east of
Macon, in Georgia. This place is on the direct line to Florida, and
not far from the frontier. It stands on a tributary of the Suwanee
River, of which the Chattahoochie is another tributary, and which
empties itself into the Gulf. In all probability Mr. Davis expected to
be able to get down this river to the sea, and thus clear
away. General Wilson states that, as a last resort, Mr. Davis
disguised himself in one of his wife's dresses and sought refuge in
the woods. When brought to bay, he threatened his captors with a
bowie-knife, but surrendered on the presentation of a revolver.</p>
<p>By the Hibernian, which brings intelligence from New York to the
20th ult., we learn that Jefferson Davis, with his wife, son, two
daughters, and eighteen other prisoners, has been conveyed to Fort
Monroe, where they were strictly guarded. Breckenridge is supposed to
have escaped over the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Times</hi> says that the
deliverance of Davis to the gallows will only help to consign the
rebellion to infamy. The <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> regards him as
an accessory to Mr. Lincoln's murder, and says there is no human
possibility that he can escape the full penalty of the law. The <hi
rend="italic">Tribune</hi> trusts that Davis will be treated as a
prisoner under the protection of the dignity and honour of a
self-respecting people.</p>
<p>Magruder had made a speech at Houston, Texas, in which he expressed
his determination to continue the war. Sheridan left New York on the
19th ult. for Texas, in order to suppress the rebellion in that
State.</p>
<p>Regular warfare having ceased to the east of the Mississippi by the
capitulation of the Confederate armies, the Secretary for War has
notified that after June 1, all persons found in arms in those regions
will be punished with death.</p>
<p>A reward of 25,000 dols. is offered for the arrest of Governor
Smith, of Virginia. A troop of cavalry was in pursuit of Governor
Magrath in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The New York papers say that the amnesty proclamation will include
all the Confederate soldiers below the grade of
lieutenant-general.</p>
<p>The negroes have petitioned for the suffrage.</p>
<p>The Government have admitted reporters to the conspiracy trial, and
all the evidence which was heard while the Court sat with closed
doors has been published. According to a correspondent of the <hi
rend="italic">Express</hi>, the evidence implicating Davis in the
assassination plot has proved to be unfounded. His capture will,
however, soon set the question at rest. Witnesses testified to having
seen Booth in Canada conversing with George Saunders. Booth was also
present at secret conferences of the rebel officers at Stanton,
Virginia. All the prisoners in court were heavily ironed. The
specification charges them with with conspiring with John Surratt,
Wilkes Booth, Jefferson Davis, George Saunders, Beverly Tucker, Jacob
Thompson, Wm. Cleary, C. C. Clay, Geo. Young, and others unknown, to
murder President Lincoln, Johnson, Seward, and Grant, in aid of the
rebellion. Harrold is charged with aiding Booth to commit murder and
assisting his escape, Payne with attempting the assassination of
Mr. Seward, and  with lying in wait to murder President Johnson and
General Grant. Mudd, Arnold, and Mrs. Surratt are charged as accessory
to the crime. Mr. Reverdy Johnson has been admitted as counsel for
Mrs. Surratt. One witness testified that Surratt visited Richmond last
March, accompanied by a lady, and on his return to Washington had
about 200 dols. in gold. He stated that he had seen Jefferson Davis
and Benjamin, and that Richmond would not be evacuated. On his return
from Richmond Surratt left for Montreal, and returned to Washington
the day before Lincoln's assassination. The Assistant Secretary for
War, Mr. Dana, has, it is stated, identified the key to the cipher
found in the office of the Confederate Secretary Benjamin with the
one found in Booth's trunk. Major Eckert has identified the
translation of a despatch sent from Canada to Richmond in cipher.</p>
<p>President Johnson had exchanged courtesies with the new French
Ambassador, and it is clear from the remarks made by both personages
that the relations between the two Governments are of the most
friendly character.</p>
<p>On the 13th ult. the ram Stonewall was at Havannah, receiving guns
and ammunition there. The Captain-General of Havannah refused the
request of the United States Consul that she should be surrendered as
a pirate.</p></div2>

<p>Lord Palmerston, replying to an inquiry of Mr. Lefevre, repeated
his statement of a former night, to the effect that communications had
been going on for a considerable time between the United States and
British Governments with regard to the captures made by the Alabama
and other Confederate vessels of war. The tenour of these
communications was of the same kind as the tenour of those which had
already been laid on the table. The latest of these had been received
since the accession of Mr. Johnson to the presidency; but whether the
instructions on which it was made were issued by President Lincoln or
President Johnson he could not say....</p></div2>

<p rend="center">ECHOES OF THE WEEK.</p>
<p>....America and England are soon to be again linked together, the
Atlantic telegraph cable of 2600 miles being this week completed. If
successful, let us hope that, as English money has made the cable, an
English ship has taken it out; as it has been made upon English
ground, designed by an English firm, and has owed its construction to
English inventors, our Transatlantic friends will let us have a little
more credit in the matter than they did some years ago, when the
junction was made complete for one moment and then failed. How many
ardent English souls felt bitter disappointment then! Mr. Thackeray
was one who lost a thousand pounds in that adventure for the partial
success and incipient boldness of which Mr. Cyrus W. Field and the
Americans took all the credit, and gave the blame of non-success to
the elements. It may seem to some of little moment if, while we know
whose the true merit is, we allow others to take away the praise; but
in reality this weakness does re-act upon us. The unthinking flock to
the most prominent and powerful or prominently powerful, and
eventually a mass of such people become of weight. If his own country
really knew America as well as the Hon. D'Arcy M'Ghee, England would
be saved some sad, sad trouble in Ireland. It is because impulsive
Paddy believes that the Yankee pays better, talks louder, does greater
things, stoops lower, jumps higher, dives deeper and comes out drier
than any one else in the world that he is attracted by thousands to
his shores....</p>
<p>Of general Echoes silence must be taken as the antithesis to the
Irish echo, which repeated more than it heard. There is a "monster"
meeting of teetotallers on Hampstead Head on Whit Monday for the
purpose of promoting the Prohibitory Bill. Lord Fermoy and the borough
and county members have been invited to attend. Pleasant irony, is it
not? The representatives of the press will be "accommodated." In
France M. Montalembert has declared that the victory of the North is
one of virtue over vice, liberty over slavery; and the medallists of
Paris--who, by-the-way, cut some of the finest medals ever seen to
commemorate the Russian defeat of Napoleon--will issue a gold medal to
the memory of Abraham Lincoln. Ex-President Davis languishes in the
casemates of Fortress Monroe; a letter in cipher has been brought as
witness against him; and Governor Brown, of Georgia, Governor Smith,
of Virginia; and Governor Magrath, of South Carolina, will be produced
(the latter when caught) as witnesses against him. Even the journals
which defend him are, according to the <hi rend="italic">Daily
News</hi>, "taking a course calculated to diminish whatever chances
there may be of saving him from the scaffold." Mr. Davis may meditate
upon the treatment of Richard II., for, like him, he is in that
position that "none are so poor as to do him reverence." We wait to
hear two things from America--the first is the effect of the Queen's
letter and English condolence; the second a denial or a confirmation
of the astounding statement that the counsel appointed for political
prisoners have, with one exception, that of Mr. Reverdy Johnson,
refused to defend the accused.</p></div2>

occupied for the storing of military implements and munitions by the
War Department of the fallen Government, and which were consigned to
the flames by order of their own General, Breckenridge, when their
army evacuated the city, early on the Monday morning of the above
date. The fire, which thus began with the destruction of the
Government offices, workshops, and storehouses, was raging unchecked a
few hours later, when General Weitzel, of the Federal army, entered
the city with his detachment of negro troops; and, spite of all his
efforts to preserve the city, whole streets were consumed, including
many of the shops, warehouses, factories, and flour-mills, with one of
the railway stations and several public edifices, which were not, like
the armoury and arsenal, appropriated to warlike uses.</p></div2>

<p>The grand jury of the district of Columbia have found true bills of
indictment against Jefferson Davis and Breckenridge for treason. They
are indicted separately, the overt act being the raid, in July last,
within the district of Columbia, Breckenridge having been present in
person and Davis constructively.</p>
<p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Philadelphia Inquirer</hi>,
Davis is manacled on both ankles, the connecting chain being 3
ft. long. He resisted manacling, and it became necessary to throw him
down and hold him until the irons were clinched. The <hi
rend="italic">Herald</hi> denies this statement, and says that Davis
is confined in a casemate comprising two rooms. A guard is with him
constantly, but he is not manacled, nor are his movements within the
casemate restricted.</p>
<p>The story of Mr. Davis's attempt to escape in his wife's clothing
is now discredited. Of the many accounts furnished no two are
alike. The latest version of the affair comes from Washington, and
represents that Colonel Pritchard has presented to the War Department
the historical garments themselves, which are now said to consist of
a waterproof cloak, used by Mr. Davis as a skirt, and a shawl, which
he used as a hood. It seems probable that the petticoat hoax has been
purposely circulated by certain officials in order to heap ridicule
upon the Confederate leader. Caricatures representing Mr. Davis
attired in hoop-skirt, shawl, and bonnet, are sold all over the
country. Also others representing him, in similar costume, brought to
bay, bowie-knife hand. Few of the leading journals indorse these
absurdities.</p>
<p>Governor Letcher, of Virginia, James A. Seddon, and Judge Campbell
have been arrested. Alexander Stephens and Postmaster Regan have been
sent to Fort Delaware, and Wheeler and his Staff to Fort
Warren. C. C. Clay has surrendered; he denies all complicity Lincoln's
assassination.</p>
<p>It is persistently reported that General Lee is to be arrested and
indicted for treason.</p>
<p>In the conspiracy trials at Washington the evidence for the
prosecution has been completed and the defence opened. The prisoners
have set up an alibi. Two important witnesses have been examined, and
their testimony has been withheld. Witnesses in open court have
testified that Jacob Thompson had heavy money transactions with the
Ontario Bank at Montreal. The cipher messages intercepted between
Canada and Richmond make no allusion to the assassination of
Mr. Lincoln. The cipher found by Secretary Davis was in Secretary
Benjamin's office. A letter addressed to Davis, signed Alston, has
been produced in court. The writer offers to rid the South of some of
her deadliest enemies. The letter is indorsed:--"Referred, by
direction of the President, to the Secretary of War to Harrison, Nov.,
1864, for attention, by order, J. A. Campbell, A.S.W."</p>
<p>From Texas there is news of a skirmish of little
importance. General Hood and his staff are said to have got across the
Mississippi. One report has it that Kirby Smith wished to surrender,
but that some of the generals under his command refused to go with
him. The latest accounts from New York, to the evening of the 27th
ult., state that commissioners from Kirby Smith, accompanied by
General Heron and Commander Foster, arrived at Baton Rouge on the 23rd
ult., and it is asserted that terms have been arranged for the
surrender of Smith's whole army.</p>
<p>President Johnson had issued a proclamation opening all the ports,
except those of Texas, to foreign trade, and removing all trade
restrictions east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> says that the Attorney-General
has decided that that the amnesty proclamation was a means to secure
the suppression of the rebellion. The rebellion ended, the amnesty is
void. It does not restore citizenship or property. The confiscation
decrees are in full force, and the exercise of executive clemency
cannot extend to the future.</p>
<p>President Johnson is reported to have said that he will leave
question of granting the suffrage to the negroes to the decision of
the loyal people of the interested States.</p>
<p>Five tons of archives of the Confederate Government had been
captured in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The <hi rend="italic">New York Herald</hi> has proposed a scheme to
liquidate the national debt by the voluntary subscription of 300,000
persons at 10,000 dols. each. Upwards of a million dollars have been
subscribed in two days in furtherance of this proposition.</p>
<p>Grant and Sherman's armies, numbering 150,000 men, marched, on the
23rd and 24th ult., from the Capitol at Washington through
Pennsylvania-avenue, past the White House, where Grant reviewed the
troops in presence of Mr. Johnson and the Cabinet. An enthusiastic
crowd thronged the line of procession. Sherman was loudly cheered.</p>
<p>In the number of the <hi rend="italic">Augusta Sentinel</hi> of May
2 was the last printed relic of slavery likely to be seen in that part
of the South. It was the advertisement of "T. Savage Hayward,
auctioneer" who posed to sell at the "Lower market, on May 2, the
coloured man Peter, a finished waiter, and the negro woman Laura, a
good field hand." General Upton reached the city next day and
T. Savage Hayward was glad to escape.</p>
<p>The Federal Government has given the best proof of its
determination to maintain a strictly neutral line of policy towards
Mexico by seizing a barque containing Mexican emigrants which had
sailed from an American port.</p>
<p>The Confederate ram Stonewall has been surrendered unconditionally
to the Cuban authorities, by whom it will probably be handed over to
the representative of the United States.</p>
<p rend="center">BRITISH NORTH AMERICA.</p>
<p>Dr. Blackburn has been committed for trial at the Toronto Assizes
on the charge of violating the neutrality laws.</p>
<p>After a protracted dispute, the Canadian Government has a

<p>Some of the leading commercial men of Montreal are to attend the

<p>Tuesday's <hi rend="italic">Gazette</hi> contains an official
letter from Earl Russell, formally withdrawing belligerent rights from
the ships of "the so-called Confederate States." Any such vessels that
may now be in British ports are forthwith to depart, and, for the last
time, United States vessels that may be watching them, will be
prohibited from doing so before the lapse of twenty-four hours. If the
commanders of Confederate vessels wish to divest them of their warlike
character they may do so, but at their own risk.</p>
<p>President Johnson commences his presidential career with an
intimation that he declines to receive any presents. To some wealthy
citizens who sent him a splendid carriage and a "span of horses," he
writes:--"While I fully appreciate the purity of your motives in thus
tendering to me such substantial evidence of your regard and esteem, I
am compelled, solely from the convictions of duty I have ever held in
reference to the acceptance of presents by those occupying high
official positions, to decline the offerings of kind and loyal
friends. The retention of the parchment conveying your sentiments, and
the autographs of those who were pleased to unite in this
manifestation of regard, is a favour I would ask; and I assure you,
gentlemen, I shall regard it as one of the highest marks of respect
from any portion of my fellow-citizens. Trusting that I shall continue
to merit your confidence and esteem in the discharge of the high and
important duties upon which I have but just entered, and with the best
wishes for your health, &#x0026;c., individually, I am, gentlemen,
yours truly, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew Johnson.</hi>"</p>
<p>The friends of General Grant in Philadelphia have presented him
with a new house, completely  furnished. The arrival of the General,
with his family, last week, was (says the <hi rend="italic">Boston
Congregationalist</hi>) characteristic of the man. He made special
request of the committee of presentation that there should be no
reception or public announcement of his coming, and so careful were
the gentlemen at the committee of the General's wishes that, outside
of their own number, not twenty persons in the city knew of his coming
till he landed at Walnut-street Wharf. The General's staff for this
peace movement consisted of his wife and three children, and maid, and
Lieutenant-Colonel Parker, an Indian, who has accompanied General
Grant since the beginning of his Mississippi campaign. Before a crowd
could gather, the party were welcomed within the doors of 2009,
Chestnut-street, by the committee of presentation and a few ladies
from their families. George H. Stuart, chairman of the committee, in a
brief greeting, that touched all hearts by its allusions to the
General's bright career, and the nation's joy and love, presented the
deed and the keys of the house. The General's response was briefer
still, and he broke down with emotion in the attempt to express
gratitude for so generous a recognition of humble service for
country. After the introduction to the house in all its apartments,
the family were invited upstairs to a collation spread by ladies. The
house is one of a block of brick, with brown stone dressing, on
Chestnut-street, above 20th. It is new and neat, and, like its
occupant, without pretension, and eminently adapted for service. It
cost, with the furniture, not far from 50,000 dols.</p></div2>

<p>....If the stories about the treatment of Mr. Davis at Fortress
Monroe be true, so much the worse for American humanity. If they be
untrue, the authors of them should be at once punished. The bitterest
opponents of that successful republic, which has now an Ireland--nay,
a Poland--of its own, and which holds an enemy who has been far less
bitter, less expensive, more courteous, and less abusive and virulent,
than Napoleon was to us,--her bitterest opponents can wish nothing
better than she should iron her enemy, throw him down on his back, and
rivet his manacles, while he is begging to be shot rather than thus
insulted. To be treated worse than we should treat a furious
burglar--to be debarred from book and candle, pen or paper, and to be
shut up ironed and alone--is surely beyond the bitterness of
death. Really the old country, that stoopid old grandmother England,"
comes out brightly in her treatment of Napoleon fifty years ago. He
was too shifty and too expensive an enemy to be let loose; but he had
an island given to him, he was still Emperor, still waited on by his
devoted friends. We did not call in the smith and the manacles. Do,
pray, Mr. Johnson, permit the New York press to deny these
charges. Slay the victim, if it is to be so; but do not torture him
before he be slain....</p></div2>

<p>The surrender of General Kirby Smith, which we were able to
announce in a large portion of last week's Number, took place on the
26th ult. It is unofficially reported that the same terms have been
granted to him as were accorded to Lee and Johnston. This surrender
includes the whole of the Confederacy across the Mississippi, so that
the Federal Government has not an enemy left in the field. On the
receipt of this intelligence President Johnson ordered the immediate
release of all the prisoners who have been sentenced by military
tribunals to imprisonment during the war. The Government,
notwithstanding the surrender of Smith, has dispatched an extensive
military and naval expedition, fitted out at Fortress Monroe, to
Texas.</p>
<p>The President has issued a proclamation of amnesty and restoration
to the rights of property, except in slaves and cases wherein
proceedings under the Constitution laws have been instituted, to all
persons who have directly or indirectly participated in the
rebellion, and who will subscribe to the oath to support the
Constitution, the Union, and all emancipation laws and proclamations,
except those included in fourteen clauses of exceptions:--All civil,
diplomatic, judicial and State officers, soldiers above the rank of
colonels, sailors above the rank of lieutenants, prisoners of war,
political prisoners, raiders from foreign territories, those
implicated in the ill-treatment of Federal prisoners, members of the
Federal Congress of 1861 who have aided rebellion, any persons from
the loyal States, or those in the seceded States owning property to
the value of 20,000 dols. who have voluntarily aided the rebellion,
and those who, having once taken Mr. Lincoln's amnesty oath of 1863,
have disregarded its obligations. The proclamation concludes with
notice that to those of the excepted classes who shall make special
application to the President for pardon such clemency will be extended
as may be consistent with the facts of the case and the dignity and
peace of the United States.</p>
<p>This proclamation bears the counter-signature of W. H. Seward,
being the first official document which the Secretary of State has
signed since the murderous attack made upon him on April 14.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward, in accordance with the direction of the
President's amnesty proclamation, has issued a circular in regard to
the administration of the oath of allegiance. The oath may be
subscribed before any commissioned officer--civil, military, or
naval--in the service of the national Government, or any civil or
military officer of a loyal State or territory who by the laws thereof
may be qualified for administering oaths.</p>
<p>President Johnson has also issued a proclamation appointing William
W. Holden provisional Governor of North Carolina, with power to call
an election by the loyal people who shall have taken the new amnesty
oaths to appoint delegates to revise the State Constitution and
restore the State to the Union under such a form of local government
as will entitle its people to protection by the United States against
invasion, insurrection, and domestic violence. The military in the
State are ordered to assist Governor Holden in carrying out the
provisions of the proclamation, and the different departments of the
Federal Government are directed to take possession of the public
property, and to forthwith put in force their respective laws
applicable to the geographical limits of the State.</p>
<p>General Grant had arrived in New York, and had been received with
great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Messrs. Wendell Phillips and Amasa J. Parker, in speeches to the
Anti-Slavery Convention in Boston, denounced President Johnson's plan
for the restoration of North Carolina to the Union, and decided that
construction without negro suffrage would be a practical surrender to
the Confederacy and a gross fraud upon the people of the
North. Mr. Sumner has addressed a letter to the coloured men of North
Carolina telling them to insist on all the rights and privileges of
citizens and declaring that whoever robs them of those rights is a
usurper and an impostor.</p>
<p>Mr. Jefferson Davis has been transferred from Fortress Monroe to
the Capitol prison at Washington. The reports that he had been
manacled are somewhat conflicting; but they have not been officially,
or even semi-officially, denied. Mr. Davis will, it is rumoured, be
tried by the District Supreme Court, under the presidency of Judge
Carter; but the trial will not take place until September.</p>
<p>The trial of the alleged conspirators at Washington is
progressing. The prosecution had produced Mr. Lewis F. Bates, of
Charlotte, North Carolina, whose house Mr. Jefferson Davis made his
stopping-place during his flight from Richmond. Evidence wee given
that, on the 19th of April, Mr. Davis addressed an assemblage of
persons in front of Mr. Bates's house, reading to them a telegram
announcing the assassination of Mr. Lincoln and the probable killing
of Seward, which he is represented to have supplemented by giving
utterance to Macbeth's murderous soliloquy, "If it were done, when
'tis done, then 'twere well it were done quickly." On the next day,
in Mr. Bates's house, during a conversation between Davis and
Breckenridge on the assassination, in which the latter regretted the
crime merely because he regarded the occurrence as unfortunate for the
South, Davis is stated to have remarked, "Well, General, I don't
know," and repeated his Shakesperean quotation. An employ&#x00E9; at
Ford's Theatre testified to the prisoner Spangler, carpenter to the
establishment, having assisted the escape of Booth immediately after
the assassination. Numerous witnesses have been examined, with the
view of impairing the evidence for the prosecution. Insanity has been
pleaded in defence of Payne and Atzeroth.</p>
<p>The Military Commission has sentenced Senator Harris, of Maryland,
to three years' imprisonment and the forfeiture of political
rights. President Johnson has approved this finding, but remitted the
sentence and released Mr. Harris. The President has also commuted the
sentence on the Indianapolis conspirators--Bowles, Mulligan and
Horsey--to imprisonment for life.</p>
<p>An abstract of General Sherman's report to General Grant
animadverting in strong terms against the conduct of Halleck and
Stanton towards him has been published. Halleck has been superseded
by Thomas, and it was believed that Stanton would have to retire from
the Cabinet. The Western troops of General Sherman's army have broken
up their camps around Washington, and are being transported westward,
to be mustered out of service in their respective States. General
Sherman has arrived in New York. In his farewell address to the army
he recommends the men to return to peaceful pursuits, and not to seek
new adventures abroad, which would only lead to death and
disappointment.</p>
<p>The scheme for the liquidation of the national debt by voluntary
subscriptions is being followed up.</p>
<p>The Senate of Tennessee had passed a bill declaring that all voters
in that State must be white male citizens, twenty-one years old, and
excluding from the suffrage all persons more than twenty-one years old
who had "aided the rebellion."</p>
<p>Some Southern papers report that the people are disposed to accept
the new order of things, and to stand by the Government to
re-establish order and and industry.</p>
<p>The 1st of June, appointed by President Johnson for national
mourning for the death of President Lincoln, was observed throughout
the North by suspension of business and by religious services.</p>
<p>Secretary Seward has rescinded the order requiring persons
entering the United States to be provided with passports.</p>
<p>The American Telegraph Company had announced that, with the
termination of the war, telegraphic communication between New York and
New Orleans and all the intermediate cities had been restored.</p>
<p>Several persons have been arrested at San Francisco for complicity
in a conspiracy to seize a steamer and put it to sea as a Mexican
privateer.</p>
<p>The Ordnance D&#x00E9;p&#x00F4;t Magazine at Mobile exploded on the
25th ult. Eight blocks of buildings and 8000 bales of cotton were
destroyed and 300 persons killed.</p></div2>

<p>The Earl of <hi rend="smallcaps">Derby</hi> called attention to two

piracy against persons trading with the excepted ports.</p>
<p>Earl <hi rend="smallcaps">Russell</hi> said when his letter was
written the war in America was practically ended, and only two
Confederate vessels remained afloat, one of which was about to
surrender to the authorities at Havannah. Having first ascertained
from Mr. Adams that the United States had determined upon abandoning
their belligerent rights, he at once brought the question before the
Cabinet. The war had now entirely ceased, and the maritime Powers of
Europe had expressed concurrence in the decision of the British
Government. With regard to the proclamation of President Johnson, it
was certainly a curious document, and that portion of it which
denounced as piracy the attempt to trade with ports not blockaded was
somewhat startling. Sir Frederick Bruce had immediately sought an
explanation, but could get none, and his opinion was that the threat
was merely meant to be suspended <hi rend="italic">in

<p>....This column of June 3 having, it would seem, unduly reflected
on Mr. Cyrus W. Field, I subjoin a letter from Professor Thomson, who
was associated with Mr. Field in the first great, and temporarily
successful, enterprise; and also add a paragraph from Mr. Varley, the
celebrated electrician. It would seem that "Mr. Field and his
associates in America, having obtained the sole privilege, for fifty
years, of placing a telegraph cable on the shores of Newfoundland,
actually laid the line connecting that island with the United
States. They next induced the United States Government to take
soundings across the Atlantic, after which Mr. Field came to England;
and, joining himself to Mr. J. W. Brett, Mr. C. T. Bright, and
Mr. Whitehouse, promoted the formation of the Atlantic Telegraph
Company. The capital of &#x00A3;350,000 was raised in twenty weeks,
Mr. Field himself taking shares to the amount of &#x00A3;88,000. He
has crossed the Atlantic, at his own expense, thirty-three times on
this business. In 1858 he refused a present of &#x00A3;1000 offered
him by the directors as a reward for his services. So much for
Mr. Cyrus Field's part in the undertaking. With regard to the naval
officers and engineers, it is not denied that those belonging to this
country received in America the same medals and other honorary rewards
as were bestowed upon their American colleagues." I give Professor
Thomson's letter entire:--</p>
<q><p>I remarked with surprise a statement in your Number of June 3 to
the effect that Mr. Cyrus Field and the Americans had "taken all the
credit" of the temporary success of the first Atlantic cable. Having
been cognisant of the main facts of the case from the commencement, I
can confidently express the opinion that injustice has been done to
both the Americans and Mr. Field in that remark. In answering
congratulatory addresses which, immediately after his landing with the
end of the cable were very naturally given to him both by his
countrymen and our own people of our North American colonies, he most
fully and handsomely gave credit to English directors and executive
officers of the company, and on no occasion claimed or admitted more
than the most moderate statements of credit for his own very large
share in the great work. I believe also that, to the utmost of their
knowledge, the American press gave credit to all our countrymen who in
any way promoted or assisted the undertakings. The rapid and
lamentable change from exultation in a supposed success to painful
disappointment did, however, prevent, on both sides of the Atlantic, a
full and well-balanced judgment of the claims of all concerned, which
no doubt would have done effective justice to all. I am, &#x0026;c.,

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">A Grand</hi> review of the Federal armies
under the command of General Grant and General Sherman took place at
Washington, before President Johnson, on the 23rd and 24th ult., the
army of the Potomac, numbering 75,000 men, being reviewed on the first
day, and General Sherman's army, nearly 85,000, on the second. We are
indebted to Messrs. Brady and Co., of Washington, for our Illustration
of the first day's martial display, in Pennsylvania Avenue, near the
White House, with the pavilion, or grand stand, where the President
and his Cabinet Ministers, accompanied by some members of the Senate,
the Judges, the chief Government officials, and other persons had
taken their seats to behold the troops marching past. They had a very
imposing appearance, all arms of the service being represented in full
force. The occasional introduction of a body of Zouaves served to
relieve the sameness. The dark and light blue uniforms gave fine
effect to the spectacle, looking up the broad avenue. There was a
continuous moving line, as far as the eye could reach, of national,
State, division, brigade, regiment, and other flags. Some of them were
new, their stars of gold leaf glittering in the sun, and contrasted
strongly with the flags tattered in battle or worn to mere shreds. The
troops were well clad, and their fine marching elicited praise from
every spectator. As the different corps and divisions passed before
the President and General Grant, their respective commanders left the
column and took seats on the platform. The troops occupied six hours
in review, from nine o'clock in the morning until three in the
afternoon.</p></div2>

<p>Messrs. Horace Greeley, Wendell Phillips, Gerritt Smith, and others
are arguing strenuously against the hanging of Mr. Jefferson
Davis. They declare that it would be a gross breach of faith to try
General Lee or other pardoned men. In the course of a speech delivered
on negro suffrage at the Cooper Institute, New York, Mr. Wendell
Phillips observed:--"It is idle to talk of punishing the South. 'You
cannot,' said Burke, 'indict a nation. I cannot draw an indictment
against a whole people,' said the great British orator. It would be in
vain, also, to indict as guilty of murder fourteen States, or to
convict them of treason. Every unnecessary severity is cruel; and if
this nation is as strong as it seems to be, it does not need vengeance
(Applause)....I shall never consent to the death of Jefferson Davis
until I fear his life. He is weaker alive, a ridiculous fugitive, than
dead and buried in the sympathies of millions. Let him live, then. I
once said of John Brown, 'Virginia dared not let him live.' No man,
with my consent, shall have it to say of this strong, serenely secure
nation, 'It dared not let Davis live.' We are too strong to need
vengeance."</p>

<p rend="center">....And so Spiritualism is, in the person of
Dr. J. B. Ferguson, about to bid us farewell. At the Spiritual Lyceum,
a place in Newman-street, formerly a dancing-saloon, but now opened
for a free trade in Divinity, with a fresh supply of unlicensed
Spirits, the friends of the Doctor did present him with a testimonial
and a "purse of gold." That last is a term of indefinite value which
sets one thinking. The occasion of this presentation was that the
Doctor is going "from our midst" and his mission is "to heal the
wounded souls of the Southmen and Northmen, to plead for justice and
peace." Alas! the bodies of many of them may want healing too; but
even of these souls let us hope that Ferguson may take heed. He was a
great institution at the Davenport s&#x00E9;ances, and always a
subject of mild wonder to the present writer, who, having slapped and
pinched him in a dark s&#x00E9;ance, has heard the good Doctor
thereafter expatiate on his being touched by "spirit hands." And this
gentleman is, it seems, the spiritual, ghostly, or religious adviser
of President Johnson. "He was for years an occasional, and often a
regular, attendant upon me as one of my parishioners. Him I know, and,
knowing, have followed his extraordinary history, and have freely
communed with him upon all the great questions the revolution has
forced upon our people." They did say that Lincoln was a Spiritualist:
here we have direct testimony that Johnson is the intimate and
disciple of the ablest and boldest spiritualist. What next, and
next?</p>
<p>But Dr. J. B. Ferguson is more. Does anybody remember--does not
everybody remember--Mr. Mark Tapley's Eden and the wonderful Scadder,
the land-agent? He was a Utopian, he was, and Dr. Ferguson has ideas
that way, too. "I trust to be able to show the British capitalist how
permanent investments may be made on American soil!" As if the British
capitalist did not know that! Shade of Sydney Smith, haunt this
doctor! Permanent investments!--permanent is a good word. "Without
indulging in any Utopian speculations on the most practical basis, I
hope to found a colony in one of the fairest and most fertile regions
of that country." Labourers, artisans, and <hi
rend="italic">teachers</hi> will be needed there, and opportunities
for moral, social, and religious reforms, equal if not superior (<hi
rend="italic">sic</hi>) to any offered in the palmiest days of
colonisation." I must now appeal to he spirit of a different
Smith--not Sidney, but Joseph. Are we to have a new religion in that
fair region? At present, in America, the spiritual mediums do not
prosper, one having been arrested by the revenue officers for not
taking out a license as a juggler. The Davenports have made an
alliance with Mr. Guppy, the author of the celebrated work "Mary
Jane," who accounts for all these rapping drawings and prophetic
whisperings by a theory of "chemical fluids and phosphoric essence."
Guppy has fitted up a ch&#x00E2;teau near Paris, and is going to
convert the savans of Europe. Well, did not MM. Mesmer and Cagliostro
once try to do the same? After this business, ladies and gentlemen
adjourned, we are told, to the Lyceum Hall up stairs, where another
meeting was held of a "snug and social character."</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH CABLE.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Once</hi> more we are upon the threshold of an
attempt to link together by means of the telegraphic cable the Eastern
and Western hemispheres. That it may issue in permanent success will
be the universal wish on both sides of the Atlantic. The experiment
made seven years ago has demonstrated the feasibility of the
undertaking, for it will be hard indeed if the ground which science
won science cannot find means to retain. The compliments exchanged
between our gracious Sovereign and the President of the United States,
albeit so soon followed by an irremovable obstruction in the line by
which they were conveyed, were regarded then as the first fruits of an
enterprise destined to unite in closest amity the two great branches
of the Anglo-Saxon race. That promise was premature. One cannot say
that it was without significance--for, like the dove sent forth from
the ark which returned to Noah with an olive leaf, so the first
message transmitted from the Old to the New World by means of an
electric wire was a prophecy that in due time the ocean should
practically cease to separate Europe from America. Believing in that
"sure word," scientific men have studied with praiseworthy assiduity
and perseverance all the conditions of complete success, and, with one
exception only, are confident of a favourable result. That exception
relates to the weather during the period of laying the cable. Nautical
experience has selected what is supposed to be the most auspicious
fortnight in the year, and they whose knowledge is best grounded and
most reliable assure us that the probabilities of accomplishing the
much-desired object reach very near to moral certainty. We shall
assume, then, that the Great Eastern, in the capacious hold of which
the precious coil has been stowed away in tanks; will, on this
occasion, belie her reputation for singular ill-fortune, and will
safely "pay out" the cable's length from Valencia to Newfoundland. We
shall take for granted that within the present month regular
telegraphic communication will be established between the two
hemispheres, and that shortly afterwards the London journals will
commence a daily summary of the New York news of the day before. We
know well enough--and if we did not there are many ready to tell
us--that</p><q><p rend="center">There's many a slip<lb/>'Twixt the cup
and the lip;</p></q>
<p>but we mean to disregard it, and to brave the reproach which
matter-of-fact people may deem due to an unauthorised attempt to
interpret the future. We wish to indulge in dreams which we are
strongly encouraged to believe will, not long hence, be converted into
realities; to reason upon a basis which, as everybody must be aware,
is as yet hypothetical; to give rein to our thoughts from a
starting-point which possibly may never exist. In this matter,
however, as in others we merely act upon the highest attainable
evidence; for, unless--which there is not the shadow of a reason for
suspecting--we have been greatly misled by the most competent judges,
there are more solid grounds for concluding that the cable will be
safely laid than that it will not.</p>
<p>What a prospect opens to this generation through that presupposed
event! What a cloudland, gorgeous and unsubstantial, it appears in the
distance, yet how real, material, palpable, will it prove when we are
encircled by, and grow familiar with, its marvellous phenomena! For
instantaneous communication between America and Europe means, of
course, in its ultimate development, instantaneous communication all
the world over. And so we shall have<pb n="622"/> daily before our
eyes a bird's-eye view of human affairs over the entire surface of the
globe, and shall be able to study all nations, as day by day they are
making contemporaneous pages of history. They who feel an interest in
it may pursue this thought into the yet distant ages of the
future. All peoples of all climes, of all stages and varieties of
civilisation, of all forms of social economy, political government,
and religious culture, virtually in presence of each other, and
observant of each other's mutual bearing--why, what can arise out of
this but a rapid assimilation of central ideas, and a modification of
the lower by the higher types of national organisation? We witness at
present but the initiatory stage of the process, and yet the changes
it has introduced are wonderful--wonderful even beyond the possibility
of conception by our forefathers. But we should fail in our best
attempts to realise the vast moral results which must inevitably grow
out of intimate contact between mind and mind in every region of the
earth. We are unable to imagine the different ways in which a
simultaneous knowledge of the same current facts will operate in
elevating the general condition, and moulding the more prominent
features, of humanity; but we are warranted in the belief that its
tendency will be beneficent, its influence ameliorative, its formative
virtue progressively more energetic, and its effects in unison with
the hopes of those who rejoice to believe in "a good time coming."
What was the origin of our race is a problem which sinks into
comparative insignificance beside the infinitely more interesting
question as to whither it is tending. The discoveries and applications
of science, happily, point in a direction consonant with the
instinctive yearnings of our hearts; and every new invention of
world-wide importance gives us fresh reason for adopting as the motto
of the entire human family the word "Excelsior!"</p>
<p>Leaving, however, this widest sphere of speculation, let us
restrict our thoughts to the more immediate benefits to England and
America likely to follow upon the establishment of telegraphic
communication between them. No one doubts for a moment that it will
powerfully conduce to international amity, and will be the best
possible guarantee for the maintenance of peace. War between civilised
nations, and still more between nations allied in blood, in language,
and, in religion, is seldom the first thought or desire of either when
misunderstandings arise. Events hardly ever occur which have power,
like a flash of lightning, to set the passions of the public suddenly
ablaze. The greenwood of material interests underlies the more
inflammable elements of our nature, and the fire beneath it needs to
be fanned and fed by the rubbish of evil surmises, and
misrepresentations, and exaggerations, for a considerable while before
national wrath gets kindled. Where the interval between a fancied
offence and the true explanation of it is narrowed to a single day,
there is not much room left for the play of unworthy suspicions. The
spark is trampled out before it takes hold upon what is most
combustible in the popular temper--for ignorance and misapprehension
of each other's motives is the most frequent cause of quarrel between
nations as between individuals.</p>
<p>Peace, however, is but a negative quality, although an invaluable
one. There is a more positive result of instantaneous
intercommunication to be considered. Those who have carried on large
commercial transactions with a distant country are, perhaps, the only
persons competent to estimate the uncertainty, the hazard, oftentimes
the loss, arising from doing trade upon data liable to change between
the time when the state of the market is known and a purchase is
ordered or a consignment is made, and the time when the goods arrive
at their destination. The interval of a fortnight or even less is
occasionally sufficient to change the whole aspect of the
undertaking--and the knowledge which is gained by a subsequent mail
might, if possessed a few days earlier, have saved many a merchant not
merely from torturing anxieties but from sudden bankruptcy. The
telegraphic cable, it is true, will not entirely obviate this
disadvantage, but it will at any rate diminish it by one half. Values
will still fluctuate during the period required for the transit of
merchandise, but need not be subject to changes, as now, during the
interval which must elapse between the giving and receiving of
orders. This is but one illustration of the commercial benefit to be
anticipated from the success of the experiment in hand--perhaps the
simplest and most intelligible one. Hundreds of a like bearing might
be named. The general effect, however, will undoubtedly be a large
increase of trade intercourse between the two countries, conducted,
moreover, at much less risk, and with much less of that wear and tear
of the spirits which suspense so inevitably entails.</p>
<p>Out of increased commerce springs increased amity. People whose
mutual interests demand frequent exercise towards one another of
consideration, forbearance, confidence, and a regard to honour, get to
respect one another, to appreciate one another's excellences, and to
esteem one another's character. Let these friendships be
multiplied--as they will be by the telegraphic cable--and the ties
which will bind the two nations together will be multiplied in the
same proportion. Through the medium of those ties and of others, the
prevailing sentiment of the two peoples will be every year
assimilated, and, by the influence of each upon the other, in
accordance with an infallible moral law, will be raised, refined, and
sublimated. In this way the telegraph will become a disciplinarian,
whose training, because unsuspected, will be the more felt. The novel
appliance, as between England and America, will come into play just in
time. The civil war is closed; the doom of slavery is sealed. There
remains nothing which need divide the one country from the other in
feeling. The interests of both are the same; the heart of both may be
one. May Heaven grant a propitious season for that part of the
experiment which is still uncertain, and may the consequences of
success be more important, politically, commercially, socially, and
religiously, than the most imaginative among us is able to
conceive!</p></div2>

<p>President Johnson has issued a proclamation appointing Judge
Starkey Provisional Governor for the reorganisation of the
Mississippi. This proclamation is entirely similar in its instructions
and provisions to that issued appointing Mr. Holden Governor of North
Carolina. Another proclamation has been issued removing all internal,

<p>General Kirby Smith issued his farewell address to his troops on
May 30. He declared that he at first refused to surrender upon the
terms accepted by Lee, and would have continued the struggle until
honourable terms were secured for soldiers and civilians alike; but,
upon reaching Texas, he found that the forces he had relied upon had
abandoned their cause, and that he was a commander without an army and
a general without troops.</p>
<p>According to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> correspondent,
expulsion and beating of negroes for attempting to ride in the street
cars are of daily occurrence in Philadelphia and New York. On
Saturday, the 10th ult., a party of nearly 200 soldiers attacked a
settlement of negroes in Washington, drove them from their houses,
beat them, destroyed their furniture, and appropriated whatever of
value could be found. The negroes subsequently rallied, when a fight
ensued, in which firearms were used upon both sides, and several
persons injured.  The <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> reports that in
Washington the greatest ill-will against the negroes exists, and that
they are kicked and beaten upon the most trivial pretexts; while in
Richmond the schools which had been opened for the freedmen have been
closed on account of the ill-treatment and intimidation of the black
children by the whites. A letter from Philadelphia says:--"The feeling
between the soldiers and negroes in all parts of the country is
intense. Very little provocation will be necessary to cause a riot
anywhere. The Irish are the particular enemies of the blacks, and fire
flies whenever they come together."</p>
<p>A delegation from the negroes in Kentucky have applied to the
Bureau of Freedmen in Washington for advice and assistance in
obtaining work and the means of support. They represent that the
whites in their State refuse to employ them in any capacity
whatever. They have also waited upon President Johnson and petitioned
that martial law in Kentucky might be continued; and General Palmer
granted powers sufficient for their protection. Both requests are

<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Our</hi> Special Artist and Correspondent who
was lately employed in the service of this Journal at the
head-quarters' camp of the Confederate Army in Virginia has furnished
us with an Illustration of almost the final scene in the history of
the Southern secession. After the surrender of General Lee's army and
the abandonment of Petersburg and Richmond, in the first week of
April, our Artist went to join the army of General Joseph Johnston,
and saw the last shot of the war fired; he then attended the journey
of the fallen President, Mr. Jefferson Davis, a distance of 700 miles,
to the neighbourhood of Macon, in Georgia, and did not leave the party
until it was disbanded, by Mr. Davis's request, two days before his
capture. The sketch from which our present Engraving is made was taken
by our Artist five days before the capture of Mr. Davis, when passing
over the Georgia Ridge, a range of wooded hills forming the boundary
line of the State of South Carolina. Mr. Davis is the central figure
of the three horsemen riding in front; General Bragg is on his right
hand, and Mr. Benjamin his Secretary of State, on the left; behind
Mr. Davis, and on his right hand, is General Breckenridge; next whom
is Mr. Regan, the Postmaster-General; the rest of the party are the
staff of Mr. Davis and the Kentucky soldiers of his escort. Two or
three loiterers by the roadside, in the right-hand corner of our
Engraving, seem to be watching the passage of the fugitives with
sentiments of deep compassion and regret.</p>
<p>Our Special Artist has returned to this country, bringing with him
a series of sketches illustrative of the latest scenes in the history
of the Confederate Government. These we shall engrave for early
publication.</p></div2>

<p rend="center">THE ATLANTIC TELEGRAPH.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcaps">All</hi> the preparations connected with the
departure of this great expedition are complete. Every facility has
been given by the Government to ensure, as far as possible, its
success, the resources of the dockyard at Sheerness having been placed
at the disposal of the promoters of the undertaking by the
Admiralty.</p>
<p>On Thursday week the directors gave an entertainment on board the
Great Eastern, in the hold of which the telegraph cable lies
coiled. The Lords of the Admiralty and her Majesty's Ministers were
the guests of the day; but the company included also many members of
the aristocracy. The novelty of the day was the transmission of short
messages through the entire length of the cable. The first of these,
"Success to the expedition," was spelt out in something under three
minutes, after passing through the 2228 nautical miles of cable,
stored in the big ship. Mr. J. Pender, M.P., the chairman of the
company presided, in the grand saloon; and, after giving the toasts of
"The Queen" and "The President of the United States," proposed the
"Health of her Majesty's Ministers." The Duke of Somerset, after
returning thanks, proposed "Success to the undertaking;" and the
chairman then gave "The American Minister, Mr. Adams," congratulating
all present on the friendly relations existing between this country
and the United States, and alluding with feeling to the good
friendship, delicacy, judgment, and tact Mr. Adams had invariably
displayed in every circumstance connected with this country in which
his diplomatic talents had been called into play. After a suitable
response, the party broke up, and the remainder of the afternoon was
devoted to the inspection of the ship, and to the examination of
charts and maps giving the soundings of her approaching voyage,
sanguine predictions of the complete success of the enterprise being
uttered on all sides.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern left her moorings at Saltpan Reach, near
Chatham, on Saturday last, for the Nore. Steam was got up on board at
an early hour on Saturday morning and, notwithstanding that the
machinery of the Great Eastern has not been brought into use for
considerably more then twelve months, the engines worked with
remarkable speed and regularity, while they were stopped and started
within a very few seconds after the word was passed. At half-past
twelve the order was given for starting the Great Eastern and she
immediately began moving down the Channel towards Garrison Point and
the Nore Light. The spot selected for her was about five miles below
the Nore Light, where there is a depth of at least seven fathoms at
low tides. By direction of the Government, the Porcupine,
surveying-steamer, had been previously engaged in making a survey of
the channel from the Medway to the Nore, and marking out the route by
buoys and boats, so as to prevent the possibility of any untoward
occurrence. On the Great Eastern passing the various vessels of war in
harbour, the crews crowded the rigging and saluted the steamer with
loud cheers. On board the Formidable, 84, flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir
C. Talbot, Commander-in-Chief, the marines presented arms; while on
board the Cumberland, 70, the band, as the Great Eastern steamed past,
played alternately "Rule Britannia" and "Hail, Columbia." The
paddle-wheels made about six revolutions per minute, and the screw
rather more, and this speed was maintained until the harbour was
cleared. On rounding Garrison Point a large concourse of spectators
vociferously cheered as the Great Eastern passed. Accompanying the
steamer were the Vivid, Locust, and Sheerness, Admiralty steamers,
with three private steamers, the Porcupine standing about half a mile
in advance to show the way to be taken. At a few minutes after two the
anchorage-ground below the Nore and the Mouse Lights was reached, and
the Great Eastern brought up, the whole of the operations connected
with her removal from her old to her new anchorage having been
effected without the least accident. Here she remains at anchor for a
few days for the adjustment of her compasses, and to receive on board
the remainder of her coals and stores.</p>
<p>The Great Eastern has in her about 7000 tons of cable, or,
including the iron tanks which contain it and the water in which it is
sunk, about 9000 tons in all. In addition to this she has 7000 tons of
coal on board, and 1500 tons more to take in. Her total weight,
including engines, will then be rather over 21,000 tons, a stupendous
mass for any ship to carry, but well within the capacity of the Great
Eastern, of which the tonnage is 24,000.</p>
<p>Before the following spring tides set in, which will be towards the
end of next week, the Great Eastern will start for Valencia. She will
be met there by the two ships of war, the Terrible and the Sphinx,
appointed to convoy her. Both these vessels are being fitted with the
best apparatus for deep-sea soundings; with buoys and means for
buoying the end of the cable, if it should become necessary; and with
Bollen's night-light naval signals, with which the Great Eastern is
likewise to be supplied. To avoid all chance of accident the big ship
will not approach the Irish coast nearer than twenty or twenty-five
miles, and her stay off Valencia will be limited to the time occupied
in making a splice with the massive shore end, which, for a length of
twenty-five miles from the coast, will be laid previous to her
arrival. This monstrous shore end, which is the heaviest and strongest
piece of cable ever made, will be laid from the head of a sheltered
inlet near Cahirciveen out to the distance we have stated, where the
end will be buoyed and watched by the ships of war till the Great
Eastern herself comes up. Some idea of the strength and solidity of
this great end may be guessed by the fact that its weight per mile is
very little short of half the weight of an ordinary railway metal. For
the shore end of Newfoundland only three miles are required, and this
short length will be sent in the Great Eastern. When once the splice
is made from the great cable-ship to the English shore end--an
operation which will consume about five hours--the work of laying the
cable will begin. By that time every mile of the cable in the three
tanks will have been joined up, and at a stated hour, morning and
evening, a series of signals will be sent through the cable to the
land at Valencia, and thence to London, giving the latitude and
longitude of the great ship, the state of the weather, and the number
of miles paid out. The cable will be first taken out from the forward
tank, next from that midships, and lastly from that astern; and, if
all goes well, the vessel should arrive with nearly 500 miles of cable
in her still unused--an excess which is most wisely allowed, in case
of accident. Since the paying-out apparatus has been in work its
action has been faultless.</p>
<p>Messrs. Canning, Clifford, and Temple have absolute charge of all
the details connected with the submergence. Mr. De Sauty is in charge
of the electrical condition of the cable for the makers; Mr. Varley
goes to represent the Atlantic Company; and Professor Thomson as
scientific adviser and referee. These gentlemen, however, are only the
chiefs of the various large departmental staff which will be on
board.</p>
<p>If all go well, both as to course and rate of steaming, telegraphic
communication with the United States may be looked for about the 20th
inst.</p></div2>

G. W. Bacon, (Sampson Low, Son, and Marston.) A very brief but
succinct biography of the late President of the United States of
America. It is probable that in days to come the grand simplicity,
unflinching determination, unalterable magnanimity, and universal
kindliness which distinguished Abraham Lincoln will, even more than
the recollection of his tragic death, render his name scarcely less
dear to Americans and less honoured amongst all nations than that of
George Washington; and it is well that all men should have within easy
reach the means of making themselves acquainted with the principal
events of "Honest Abe's" life and administration, from the days
preceding his "rail-splitting" to the fatal evening when he went,
against his inclination, to Ford's Theatre, "lest," in his own kindly
words, "the people should be disappointed." Mr. Bacon's book will
fulfil this purpose; it is not on a large scale. "but 'twill serve,"
and its bulk is increased by a collection of all manner of
lamentations upon Mr. Lincoln's assassination from all manner of
newspapers, and by a copy of the Constitution of the United States,
ignorance of the provisions of which was freely exhibited in the angry

<p>The death of this well-known American authoress occurred at her
residence in Hartford, Connecticut, on the 10th ult. Mrs. Sigourney
(by her maiden name Lydia Huntley) had attained the age of nearly
seventy-four years, having been born on Sept. 1, 1791. In 1819, she
was married to Mr. Sigourney, a hardware dealer in Hartford, and a man
of much culture and literary taste, and she had by him two children,
Mary, the oldest, now the wife of the Rev. Francis T. Russell of
Geneva, New York, and Andrew, whose death a few years ago was the
subject of one of her works, entitled "The Faded Hope." Her first
volume, entitled "Moral Power, in Prose and Verse," appeared in 1815,
and since that time she has been one of the most prolific American
authors. Together, her publications number nearly fifty volumes, many
of which attained a very large circulation. A prominent feature in the
character of Mrs. Sigourney was her great benevolence. She is said to
have made it a point to give at least one tenth of her income to
charitable objects.</p></div2></div1></body></text></TEI.2>
