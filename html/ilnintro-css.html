          <h2>Editors' Introduction</h2>

        <blockquote>  
            <p class="left">We began work on this project in 1988. Following a lead
            from a publishing colleague, I contacted an antiquarian
            book dealer, who was able to acquire the ten bound volumes
            of the Illustrated London News that encompassed the Civl
            War years. Each volume covers six months: January - June
            and July - December. The newspaper was published every
            Saturday and, of course, contained a great deal more than
            the news from America. Our plan was to go through the
            volumes line by line and select all the material that
            pertained to the Civil War, American social history, and
            political history.</p>

            <p  class="left">We started the selection of material, photocopying the
            requisite pages, and rekeying the text. The first volume
            and part of the second had been finished before the
            computer hard drive crashed. In the move to Georgia, the
            disks disappeared. Happily, we are well into the project
            again. In 1988, we were limited to a print version
            alone. Now there are many options.</p>

            <p class="left">Bound volumes of newspapers from the nineteenth
            century, much like magazines of the period, often vary
            from one copy to another. The title pages in the volumes
            from which this material has been drawn were added when
            the weekly issues were bound. On the verso of some title
            pages is an index to the engravings for the six-month
            period, though most of the volumes contain a separate
            index page with the engravings listed on both recto and
            verso. Many publications had special supplements, issues
            of different sizes, and loose folded supplements,
            sometimes in color. This particular set of volumes seems
            to include all the special supplements, which continue the
            pagination of the weekly issues. What are not always
            present are the infrequently issued loose supplements,
            often folded maps or colored engravings. Though these
            would be of interest, the contemporary editorials, news
            items, firsthand reports from America, and the spirited
            illustrations, usually based on sketches taken at the
            scene, provide a compelling and remarkably even-handed
            portrayal of the period.</p>

            <p class="left">The material was originally published in a 11&quot; 
            x 15 &frac34;&quot; format in three columns and many different type sizes and 
            fonts. For greater ease in reading, this version does not retain all 
            those variations in size and style. The text has been proofread at 
            least twice against the original. Volume number, page number, and 
            date (month, day, year) of the original follow each entry. The illustrations 
            adhere to the placement in the text of the newspaper as closely as 
            possible.</p>
