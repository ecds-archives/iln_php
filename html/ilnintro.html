        <blockquote> 
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial">We began work on this project in 
            1988. Following a lead from a publishing colleague, I contacted an 
            antiquarian book dealer, who was able to acquire the ten bound volumes 
            of the Illustrated London News that encompassed the Civl War years. 
            Each volume covers six months: January - June and July - December. 
            The newspaper was published every Saturday and, of course, contained 
            a great deal more than the news from America. Our plan was to go through 
            the volumes line by line and select all the material that pertained 
            to the Civil War, American social history, and political history.</font></div>
          <p><font face="Arial">We started the selection of material, photocopying 
            the requisite pages, and rekeying the text. The first volume and part 
            of the second had been finished before the computer hard drive crashed. 
            In the move to Georgia, the disks disappeared. Happily, we are well 
            into the project again. In 1988, we were limited to a print version 
            alone. Now there are many options.</font></p>
          <div align="left"><font face="Arial">Bound volumes of newspapers from 
            the nineteenth century, much like magazines of the period, often vary 
            from one copy to another. The title pages in the volumes from which 
            this material has been drawn were added when the weekly issues were 
            bound. On the verso of some title pages is an index to the engravings 
            for the six-month period, though most of the volumes contain a separate 
            index page with the engravings listed on both recto and verso. Many 
            publications had special supplements, issues of different sizes, and 
            loose folded supplements, sometimes in color. This particular set 
            of volumes seems to include all the special supplements, which continue 
            the pagination of the weekly issues. What are not always present are 
            the infrequently issued loose supplements, often folded maps or colored 
            engravings. Though these would be of interest, the contemporary editorials, 
            news items, firsthand reports from America, and the spirited illustrations, 
            usually based on sketches taken at the scene, provide a compelling 
            and remarkably even-handed portrayal of the period.</font></div>
          <p><font face="Arial">The material was originally published in a 11&quot; 
            x 15 &frac34;&quot; format in three columns and many different type sizes and 
            fonts. For greater ease in reading, this version does not retain all 
            those variations in size and style. The text has been proofread at 
            least twice against the original. Volume number, page number, and 
            date (month, day, year) of the original follow each entry. The illustrations 
            adhere to the placement in the text of the newspaper as closely as 
            possible.</font></p>
